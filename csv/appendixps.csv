Werstine, using the types identified by Hinman, confirms or slightly changes the stints analyzed by Howard-Hill and O&rsquo;Connor; he shows that in fact from the beginning of Folio setting, three type cases were employed, the ones Hinman only firmly locates as beginning in quire K.</p>"

1,0,1,0,"<p xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" class=""noindent"">He draws (p. 234) two major implications for editors and textual critics of the early Folio comedies. The first deals with cast-off copy for quires G and H. Ordinarily, as <a href=""#b_hinc1963"" class=""ref bibl"">Hinman</a> observed, when a quire was set in normal Folio printing order, there was need to cast off copy only for the first half of the quire, since the pages of the second half were set in their reading sequence [4&ndash;6<sup>v</sup>]..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. However, simultaneous composition of successive formes of a quire&mdash;possible for quire G, probable for quire H&mdash;would have necessitated casting off copy for both halves of the quire so that compositors could work concurrently from separate blocks of copy to set pages of the second half of the quire. Thus editors must be wary of compositorial attempts to stretch or squeeze the texts of <i>MM</i> and <i>Err.</i> into the space available. One such attempt is evident in the last half of quire H at the bottom of H5<sup>v</sup>b, set by Compositor C, and the top of H6a, set simultaneously by Compositor B, where verse is compressed into prose. Second, identification of cases x, y, and z [his former r, s, t] in quires G&ndash;I confirms attribution of pages in these quires to Compositors B, C, D, and F. Editors of the Folio Comedies may then have greater confidence in using the available studies of compositorial accuracy in arriving at judgments about when and how to emend. (<a href=""#b_werp2001"" class=""ref bibl"">Werstine</a> [2001], doubts that Compositor F, supposed to have set pages of the four comedies preceding <i>Err.</i> from Ralph Crane copy, can be differentiated from Compositor D, i.e., he does not exist.)</p>"
1,0,1,2,"<p xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" class=""noindent""><a href=""#b_werp2001"" class=""ref bibl"">Werstine</a>&rsquo;s example of verse compressed into prose on H5<sup>vb</sup>&ndash;H6<sup>a</sup> is weakened by observing how erratic that verse is (<a href=""#tln_1254"" class=""ref lb"">1254&ndash;8</a>; what did the compositors see in their copy? <a href=""#cn_1254a"" class=""ref note_cn"">see n.</a>), and how much white space appears in the SDs on H6. The evidence of compression on H5<sup>vb</sup> is the turnunder of (<i>sup</i>|<i>ping</i> (<a href=""#tln_1248"" class=""ref lb"">1248&ndash;9</a>)&mdash;one of only three turnunders in the entire play, one by each compositor&mdash;and, in the last line of the column, no space between the SP and the first line of a prose-lined speech, which is squeezed in when the last word <i>naile</i> might have been set on the next page. However, Compositor B&rsquo;s H6<sup>a</sup> shows no sign of compression carrying over from H5<sup>vb</sup>. As Werstine argues, Compositor B was probably setting H6 simultaneously from cast-off copy, leaving Compositor C to make all the necessary adjustments to get his allotted text into his type pages; nothing about the difficulty of reading printer&rsquo;s copy can be inferred from how B set the top of H6.</p>"
2,1,1,0,"<p xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" class=""noindent"">Because the compositors are setting from Sh.&rsquo;s MS for the first time, how they punctuated their stints proves interesting. If Hand D of <i>Sir Thomas More</i> is really Sh.&rsquo;s, he punctuated very lightly; indeed, fewer than 20 marks appear in the type facsimile in <a href=""#s_evns"" class=""ref witness"">Evans</a> (ed. 1974, pp. 1686&ndash;96). Such light pointing would impede reading comprehension, so when such copy came to the printing house, it <i>is look&rsquo;d on as a task and duty incumbent on the</i> Compositor, <i>viz. to discern and emend the bad</i> Spelling <i>and</i> Pointing <i>of his Copy</i> (<a href=""#b_moxj1683"" class=""ref bibl"">Moxon</a>, 1683&ndash;4; 1962, p. 192). Moxon goes on to say (p. 215): As he <i>Sets</i> on, he considers how to <i>Point</i> his Work, viz. when to <i>Set</i> , where ; where : and where.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . But the Rules for these having been taught in many School-books, I need say nothing to them here, but refer you to them. If Sh. carefully punctuated <i>Err.</i>, we would expect the compositors to follow his punctuation in such matters as the use of colons, semicolons, periods, and capitalization after midline question marks and periods; they were expected to follow good copy <i>strictly</i> (p. 192). In too lightly pointed copy, however, they were to make sense of the text. What happens is that each compositor treats the pointing differently. I do not mean that each compositor parses his text in a distinguishable way but rather that each shows preferences in his choice of punctuation marks. The following chart shows how each compositor handles colons and semicolons between the beginning and the end of verse lines and within prose passages; how frequently each capitalized after internal question marks; and how often each capitalized after an internal period. The relative lack of midline punctuation in the figures below reflects the fact that in Sh.&rsquo;s early blank verse the clause and the metrical line coincide most of the time.</p>"

Compositor B&rsquo;s tendency to set SDs flush right has been noticed, but no one has observed another punctuating habit, that of omitting periods in many SDs and, in <i>Err.</i> but not often in the other plays he set, at the ends of sentences that fill up his type measure. In the comedies, only Compositor B regularly omits periods in SDs; Compositor D does it once much later (Q4<sup>vb</sup> 456), and Compositor A also once (Aa2<sup>vb</sup> 452).

Expanded spacing is used to make space to fit in text that has been undercounted in casting off. The frequency with which Compositor B uses expanded spacing seems to have no bearing on this verse lined as prose, since he could have indented his flow-overs and achieved the same spatial effect. Compositor B expands normal spacing significantly more often than the others do, especially in <i>Err.</i>, where he is setting from a different kind of copy from what he had before.

At first sight it looks plausible enough to argue, as W. W. Greg does, that Exeunt omnes was added by a prompter or book-keeper on the left of the manuscript page, so duplicating the author&rsquo;s original direction on the right, and that the compositor [<i>xiv</i>] fitted them together in the printed text.

In other directions of this kind both characters are usually identified as of Syracuse or Ephesus, as at [<a href=""#tln_1440"" class=""ref lb"">1440&ndash;1</a>], Enter Antipholus of Siracusia with his Rapier drawne, and Dromio Sirac., or [<a href=""#tln_1811"" class=""ref lb"">1811&ndash;12</a>], Enter the Abbesse with Antipholus Siracusa, and Dromio Sir., and it may be conjectured that here the identification of Antipholus has been transferred to the end of the direction. The phrase a School-master, call&rsquo;d Pinch,.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is probably authorial, and Greg could not see why Chambers wanted to invoke a prompter to explain it; but the reason is, I think, clear enough, and it is the same reason that caused Greg to detect the intervention of a prompter at [<a href=""#tln_1665"" class=""ref lb"">1665</a>] and [<a href=""#tln_1898"" class=""ref lb"">1898</a>]. Both scholars wished to account for the split direction and duplication at [<a href=""#tln_1445"" class=""ref lb"">1445</a>]; this could be plausibly explained by supposing that a prompter made an addition to the manuscript at this point; and this explanation would appear more convincing if the prompter&rsquo;s hand could be found elsewhere. </p>"

The fact that the passage in F is split between the foot of one column and the top of another needs to be taken into account. He suggests that Sh. wrote a single direction in the right margin of his manuscript (p. xv), but divided it because of its length into two lines, Runne all out / as fast as may be, frighted, then, in the accident of printing, and of the division between columns, the direction was split into two and attached to different lines.

2,1,1,0,"<p xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" class=""noindent"">What accident of printing he does not say, but perhaps he was thinking of how a compositor might discover, as he transferred his block of composed type from the setting stick to the forme, that he had set too much for column a, and had to improvise to start column b, thus separating what had been a comprehensible SD. But again, this procedure hardly accounts for the fact that <i>Runne all out</i> is set in the empty space left in column a to match the space in column b used for catchwords and signatures. <a href=""#s_ard2"" class=""ref witness"">Foakes</a> is misleading when he says the passage in F is split at the foot of one column and the top of another, since foot means the last line of type normally used in a type page for text. <a href=""#b_werp1988"" class=""ref bibl"">Werstine</a> (1988, p. 244) thinks the placement of <i>Runne all out</i> in the direction line is unique in F and continues: It would appear that Compositor B was ready to take extraordinary measures to avoid setting a marginal stage direction at the top of a column. For this reason, he would not have completed the direction begun at the bottom of column H6va with the top line of column H6vb.

Aegeon was a hapless victim of the mercantile warfare, with whom Solinus sympathized, but whom he could not alter the law to save. As a merchant of souls (a frequent figure with priests generally), Hartley was the hapless victim of the warfare, both mercantile and religious, with Spain.

The way Egeon&rsquo;s family has been separated&mdash;the rock splitting their mast after the shipwreck, the two ships each rescuing one of the parents and one of the children, but unable to join, and then the grown son leaving his father to find his brother.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &mdash;recalls the father&rsquo;s tantalizing, successive losses in the Placidas [i.e., Saint Eustace] story; while Shakespeare&rsquo;s d&eacute;nouement&mdash;the prepared execution transformed into a scene of rejoicing&mdash;could have been suggested to him by the similar ending devised by Barnabe Riche. And the d&eacute;nouement.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. also borrows from the Clement legend (as well as from <i>Apollonius</i>, which Shakespeare is following to the extent of locating his play at Ephesus and making the mother an Abbess there). In the Clement legend, Peter&rsquo;s enemy, Simon Magus (Simon the enchanter), wishing to escape from execution as a magician, casts his own appearance on Clement&rsquo;s father&mdash;in Caxton&rsquo;s translation, he imprinted his similitude and likeness in this old man Faustinian, in such wise that of every man he was supposed to be Simon Magus; with the result that, although the sons recognise their father&rsquo;s voice, they would run away from him but for St Peter&rsquo;s intervention. Egeon meets with a similar [<i>66</i>] incomprehension from Antipholus of Ephesus, just before the other twin comes back on the stage: [quotes <a href=""#tln_1775"" class=""ref lb"">1775&ndash;91</a>].

(P. 66): In the context of this consistent distinction between the two stories.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. , we can see unmistakable allusions to the archetypal medieval drama that historically underlay the romantic plot. The romantic pattern of separation, wandering, and reunion, as David Bevington points out, derived directly from the moral pattern of fall from grace, temporary domination of evil, and rediscovery of divine favor&mdash;the structure that enabled travelling actors to adapt the vast drama of salvation history to the exigencies of a small troupe. What is therefore the oldest story in English drama permeates the language of the frame plot and contributes to its qualitative distinction from the newly fashionable classical action that it encloses. My fall is the play&rsquo;s first rhyme phrase, followed closely by the doom of death: Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall / And by the doom of death end woes and all ([<a href=""#tln_0005"" class=""ref lb"">5&ndash;6</a>]).

Of these plays, <i>Mother Bombie</i>, printed 1594, but acted probably in 1590, has closest affinities with <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, as being modelled on Roman comedy, though its plot, in which a group of four gay and witty servants to four old men conspire against them in helping to forward the love-schemes of their masters&rsquo; children, is Terentian, rather than Plautine. One of the servants is named Dromio, and Shakespeare may have borrowed the name from this play. [fn.: It should be noted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that this name is a variant of <i>Dromo</i>, a type-name for a slave in several of Terence&rsquo;s comedies.] His debt to Lyly, especially in the exchange between the Dromios and their masters, is too general and pervasive, however, to be reduced to a list of borrowings. It is possible to point to a number of phrases or images in Lyly&rsquo;s works which recur or are echoed in Shakespeare&rsquo;s play; for instance, I have noticed the following in <i>Mother Bombie</i>: beg him for a fool ([1.1.37; <i>Err.</i> 315]); the image of vine and elm ([1.3.124; 568]); of pulling a crow ([2.1.82; 744]); of the parrot crying rope ([3.4.57&ndash;8; 1326]); I had thought to have askt you ([4.1.36; 694]); there&rsquo;s a time for al things ([5.3.15; 458&ndash;9]); sing til we catch cold on our feet ([5.3.88; 661]); but some of these are proverbial, and some are to be found in other authors of the period also. The number of such echoes has a cumulative weight, especially when, in addition, Shakespeare employs [<i>xxxiv</i>] formal devices he learned from Lyly, and in the mock dialectics of II.ii, and again in the catechism of III.ii, recalls similar passages in <i>Midas</i>. Lyly&rsquo;s influence is felt finally in the tone of much of the comic dialogue, the cadences, the cheerful quibbling insolence of the servants, and the casual equality of speech between servant and master, who may nevertheless turn sharply on his villain at any minute.</p>"

Rather, he was overgoing Plautus, and Terence, on their supposed romantic side, as well as on that of comic intrigue. For this purpose, and for copiousness, he drew on additional sources. The leading interests of romance&mdash;as one might exemplify from Arthurian romances, from <i>The Squire&rsquo;s Tale</i>, or, coming to the period of our play, from the romance aspects of <i>Arcadia</i> and <i>The Faerie Queene</i>&mdash;were adventure; marvel, especially enchantment; the high sentiment of love, and <i>sens</i>, the implications brought out in the <i>mati&egrave;re</i>, the meaning the reader takes away with him, as a result of the author&rsquo;s treatment. Shakespeare develops into an adventure-story, that of Egeon, the successful quest for the long-lost child which in <i>Menaechmi</i> [<i>65</i>] is hardly more than a presupposition of the plot. For the initial peril demanded by a plot of this kind, he provides by translating from hoax into fact the situation of the Sienese merchant in Gascoigne&rsquo;s <i>Supposes</i> where it was already part of a drama of mistaken identities; and by heightening it from a potential threat to goods into a provisional sentence of death. The shipwreck and intervention of piratical fishermen, whereby, Egeon narrates, the family was first divided, have a probable source in Greene&rsquo;s <i>Menaphon</i>, and form a link with the source of the happy ending, the adventures of Apollonius of Tyre, related by Gower and Twine. He summarizes the relevant narrative in &ldquo;Apollonius.&rdquo; The interest of adventure is not confined to the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> and the opening scene; through the alien Antipholus it is carried into the main action. To him it seems that he has a series of adventures with the supernatural. His thoughts and feelings about them, like the providential coincidences that have brought all the members of the family to Ephesus, speak to our sense of marvel. His illusion of supernatural menace in these experiences is set against the real peril of Egeon, and against the truth of his love, even though his love-adventure, which brings the loftiest of love-sentiment into the comedy, seems to him supernatural and at least equivocally perilous too. In the idea of the town as a home of supernatural delusion, Shakespeare is again combining sources. The Epidamnum of <i>Menaechmi</i> (II.i) is notorious for cheats. The denizen&rsquo;s house there is associated by Shakespeare with Amphitruo&rsquo;s, a scene of supernatural shape-shifting. Epidamnum itself has changed to Ephesus, no doubt as the site of Diana&rsquo;s Temple in the Apollonius story, which becomes his Abbey. Diana of the Ephesians inevitably recalls Acts XIX, whence Shakespeare would remember, besides the uproar on her account, the references to curious (that is, black) arts practised in Ephesus, and to the exorcists, with whom Dr. Pinch (founded on the Medicus in <i>Menaechmi</i>) has something in common. The Ephesians are warned against supernatural foes in St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle, which also exhorts them, Geoffrey Bullough reminds us, to domestic unity, dwelling on the right relationships of husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants. With the father&rsquo;s rebuke to the wife in <i>Menaechmi</i>, and the long tradition of marital debate in mediaeval and Tudor literature, it thus contributed, no doubt, to the <i>sens</i> of the play.</p>"

Too, the scattering family is taken up by fishermen of Corinth and vessels from Epidaurus and Epidamnum. Evidently Shakespeare thinks of Epidamnum as being near Corinth and Epidaurus, seemingly near the western end of the Gulf of Corinth. This impossibility leads him to a fantasy of imagining a first version of <i>Err.</i> that would take place in Plautus&rsquo;s Epidamnus, and a second that shifts events to Ephesus with Sh. not noticing the inconsistencies the shift occasioned.

It is true that there is some interest in the ethical problems which hinge upon jealousy and that it is comedy in the true sense of a criticism of life, which is at heart profoundly serious, and employs all the machinery of wit or humour, with the deliberate intention of reaching through the laughter to the ultimate end of a [<i>26</i>] purged outlook upon things. Let an audience shake its sides at the plight into which a scold is brought by the railings of her tongue, and it is odds that they will go away with the conviction that the wiser course is not to rail..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. From one point of view, then, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is to be classed as a comedy. But if you strip the play of its ornaments of the romance plot and the ethics of jealousy, the interest declares itself as almost entirely one of plot. He then distinguishes two senses of farce, one merely a variety of comedy which, despite its roughness, still is interested in character, the second being one in which (p. 28) the interest of character is wholly replaced by an interest of plot. The conception of farce in this sense may be defined as the deduction of a logical conclusion from absurd premises. The playwright starts with some impossible assumption, which you must take for granted; however unconvincing, however grotesque, it is beyond your criticism. From this he proceeds, without any further breach of the probabilities, to show what follows, and to work out a resulting tissue of absurdities, all inherent in the initial situation. <i>Shr.</i> and <i>Wiv.</i> belong to the first kind, <i>Err.</i> to the second, though there is a (p. 29) qualification, namely that although the Ephesian twins do not know they have identical looking brothers, the Syracusan twins must have been told by Egeon of the fact, hence it is almost incredible that, when they found themselves being obviously and constantly mistaken at Ephesus for persons not themselves, the solution of the puzzle should have failed to suggest itself to them. Likewise Egeon should have figured out why he was repudiated by someone looking like his Syracusan son. There are therefore.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two assumptions, not one, made in the play; an assumption of physical [<i>30</i>] resemblance so close as to be mistaken for identity, and an assumption also of a very singular kind of oblivion in at least two of the personages.

With this explanation, natural to his melancholy temperament, he has positively encased himself in error, for it is as coherent as it is fallacious. In like fashion his choleric brother comes to attribute all his sufferings to a conspiracy instigated by his wife: both the Antipholi reach the verge of persecution-mania. Since Adriana also is given her point of view, which alters before the end, one can say of the three main persons that although they do not develop in the sense of being felt to change in character as a result of the action, their attitudes of mind develop, so that each is felt to have an inner self. That is, they are not wholly flat characters, such as might be fitting protagonists of pure farce.

If indeed themes can have value apart from the way they are dramatized, one might respond that in this play the experiences of love and marriage serve to develop the theme of what constitutes identity. Had Shakespeare intended to develop such an ideal relationship between man and woman, he missed his chance in Act V, where Luciana and Antipholus of Syracuse could have expressed their sentiments.

The play begins and ends with relationship: a family torn asunder and reunited. Relationship is the motive that has brought Egeon, and the alien Antipholus and Dromio, to the hazards of Ephesus; relationship is threatened by the tensions in the marriage of Antipholus the denizen. The chief entanglements spring from mistaken identity and mistiming: I see we still did meet each other&rsquo;s man, <br></br>And I was ta&rsquo;en for him, and he for me, <br></br>And thereupon these <i>errors</i> are arose. [<a href=""#tln_1875"" class=""ref lb"">1875&ndash;7</a>] The twins appear the same, but in reality are different; those who meet them are led by appearance into illusion. Repeatedly one of the persons assumes that he shared an experience with another, when in reality he shared it with a different one. In consequence, the persons cease to be able to follow each other&rsquo;s assumptions, and become isolated in more or less private worlds. Mistakes of identity all but destroy relationship, and loss of relationship calls true identity yet more in question; the chief persons suspect themselves or are suspected of insanity, or of being possessed, surrounded, or assailed by supernatural powers&mdash;madness or demoniac possession would be the eclipse of the true self, and sorcery might overwhelm it. The alien Antipholus and Dromio fear Circean metamorphosis; Egeon, that he has been deformed out of recognition by time. Yet the hazard of metamorphosis and of the loss of present identity is also the way to fresh or restored relationship. Antipholus the bachelor desires that Luciana will transform him and create him new; and Adriana&rsquo;s belief that in marriage the former identities coalesce and emerge identified with each other, is true if rightly interpreted. How the possessive interpretation, not relinquished by Adriana till almost the end, is at odds with the free giving and hazarding in which the wealth and debts of love differ from those of commerce, is another central theme, well traced by J. R. Brown. Adriana&rsquo;s envy of a husband&rsquo;s status contravenes principles of order that for Shakespeare and orthodox Elizabethans extended through the whole cosmos. The status of husband, and of wife, Kate&rsquo;s lines in <i>The Shrew</i> imply, are related to their places in this hierarchical order: Such duty as the subject owes the prince <br></br>Even such a woman oweth to her husband.

Out of the clashes of these private worlds of experience emerges another strand in language and action which is of some importance, a sense of evil at work in Ephesus. Dromio of Syracuse jests about the Officer who arrests Antipholus of Ephesus, calling him a devil, One that, before the judgment, carries poor souls to hell ([<a href=""#tln_1149"" class=""ref lb"">1149</a>]); he is quibbling on the last judgment, and on a common term for prison, but his jest, as is characteristic of the word-play of the Dromios, quickly becomes earnest when he meets his own master in the next scene [fn. comparing jokes on mistiming&mdash;<a href=""#tln_0205"" class=""ref lb"">205</a> ff., <a href=""#tln_0450"" class=""ref lb"">450</a> ff.&mdash;which turn out to have a bearing on the disorder later in the play&mdash;<a href=""#tln_0450"" class=""ref lb"">450&ndash;503</a> and <a href=""#tln_1025"" class=""ref lb"">1025&ndash;67</a>&mdash;and the way in which Dromio of Syracuse both parodies and reinforces his master&rsquo;s prejudices in his account of the kitchen-wench, Nell&mdash;<a href=""#tln_0933"" class=""ref lb"">933</a>].

A little later, Adriana puts her husband, as a man possessed by the fiend, into the hands of an exorcist, who chants, [quotes <a href=""#tln_1338"" class=""ref lb"">1338&ndash;9</a>].

Real horror attaches to the notion of the <i>complete</i> identity of two human beings; as in Poe&rsquo;s ghastly tale of a girl who turned out to be the re-embodiment of the mother who died in giving birth to her; and as in certain ancient legends of various lands, notably China. All normal persons (and especially Shakespeare) set so much store by human individuality that they shrink from the thought of its being submerged. And since the amusing, when intense, is nigh to the serious, there is something shuddery in the close resemblance of persons just when this appears to us intensely entertaining. I recall a school-teacher many years ago who found in her class at the beginning of the term two little girls who were remarkably, even weirdly, identical twins..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At the end of the first week the teacher exclaimed to us all with comic horror: These two are the same&mdash;how can I tell them apart? After a moment of dead silence a small boy (not I) piped out, Mary&rsquo;s temper&rsquo;s better&rsquo;n Martha&rsquo;s.

The theme of identity is here linked with those of relationship (dislocated or re-established), and of risk. To seek reunion with the lost members of the family, Antipholus is risking his identity; yet he must do so, for only if the full relationship is restored can he find content. And then, hints the image of one water-drop seeking another, the present individual identity will be lost, or transformed, in another way. It is to claim a sinking of identity in the marriage-relation, with the emergence of a new identity, where each is also the other, that Adriana uses the closely similar image in II.ii. In the play&rsquo;s harmonic structure, while this soliloquy is thus recalled at that point, in its own place it recalls the situation of Egeon, who on virtually the same quest as Antipholus, has so risked his mortal identity that it is forfeit to the [<i>59</i>] executioner. Antipholus&rsquo; fear that he is losing himself is full of comic irony. No sooner has he expressed it, than, with the entry of his brother&rsquo;s Dromio, he begins to be the victim of the successive mistakes of identity to which his words are designed by Shakespeare as a prelude, and in the course of which he will come to wonder whether he is beside himself, and has lost himself indeed. Brooks lists the mistakes based on confused identity, then It is by mistaking appearance for reality that Antipholus and his brother&rsquo;s Dromio misidentify one another. The threat to the very self involved in the confusion of appearance and reality is the thought most [<i>60</i>] vividly conveyed in Antipholus&rsquo; second soliloquy [<a href=""#tln_0261"" class=""ref lb"">261&ndash;71</a>]..&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

One problem in this essay is the paucity of quotation, which leads to the reader&rsquo;s not always recognizing the context (p. 371): Antipholus of Syracuse no sooner enters Ephesus than he is led by the device of mistaken identities to believe he has lost all his money. Having just learned of the precarious state of Syracusans in Ephesus, Antipholus of Syracuse fears that he will incur the debt which, unknown to him, his father has contracted. His financial situation is no sooner clarified than he is mistakenly accused of marital neglect by his sister-in-law, Adriana, who claims of him the obligations of husband to wife. The substitution of marital for monetary indebtedness is significant; it leads to the first possibility of redemption in the play. Antipholus of Syracuse follows Adriana to his brother&rsquo;s home, where he is promised a full dinner and Adriana&rsquo;s forgiveness. This is a plausible account of parts of 1.2 and 2.2, but one looks in vain for S. Antipholus&rsquo;s fear that he will likewise incur the debt that has been assessed Egeon (indeed, his failure to wonder about the <i>Syracusian</i> Marchant at <a href=""#tln_0165"" class=""ref lb"">165</a> is odd) or for Adriana&rsquo;s promise of forgiveness, though it is implied in shrive you (<a href=""#tln_0604"" class=""ref lb"">604</a>).

In the course of the play, he is robbed of those external assurances by which identity is normally confirmed and begins to doubt even the self-identification of his own memory; his identity is assured only at the unravelling that occurs when he and his twin are finally face to face.

This insistence is unnecessary for the audience, who already knows the plot, but apparently necessary for the fantasy about identity embedded here: for the recounting of events already familiar to the audience seems to ward off the danger that the twins, who discover themselves in the mirror relationship, will simply fuse. If <i>Comedy</i> is thus about the tenuousness of identity, it leaves us with a radical image of the frail arena of the self: for the twins must be separated out from one another to know who they are; and yet they can know who they are only by seeing themselves mirrored in one another..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p>"

The initial description of the splitting of each pair of twins, and of the parents, during their sea voyage gives us a cataclysmic image of oceanic divorce ([<a href=""#tln_0107"" class=""ref lb"">107</a>]) that seems clearly the emotional foundation for Antipholus&rsquo;s metaphor of the self confounded in the ocean.

The <i>Menaechmi</i> views social life as a petty competition for goods, for status, and for freedom to impose oneself on other people, so as to escape their imposition.

The solemn procession to the place of execution has hardly entered before it is overwhelmed by farcical confusions as various petitioners demand contrary assurances about what has happened when.

Shakespeare has reserved the play&rsquo;s most powerful poetry for a special effect&mdash;to show us the tragic abyss of estrangement at the very moment of its comic release. For now romance finally absorbs error in a characteristic expression of the comic-miraculous. One by one the errors are unpicked and repositioned as truths. But they are not, we should notice, discounted: the dinner, the chain, the purse of ducats, the diamond, are presented as the factual markers by which any society (not just a bourgeois one) comes to know itself.

The simultaneity of a jostling exit makes a good theatrical joke; it also raises, one last time, the basic question of the competitive ethic, and it offers once again the play&rsquo;s response, which is not to deny it or preach against it, but to set it side by side with the incommensurate ethic of brotherhood and family solidarity, and to leave it there without further comment. In a footnote to theatrical joke, <a href=""#b_hung1962"" class=""ref bibl"">Hunter</a> says, There may be, in addition, a reference to the Show of Amity in the <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where the representatives of Gray&rsquo;s Inn and the Inner Temple enter arm in arm to show that their quarrel over precedence has come to an end.

The third act is thus the place to begin the love of Antipholus of Syracuse for Luciana, which seems hopeless in the fourth, but ends successfully in the fifth. Conversely, the third act is the place to bring the forces opposed to the predetermined ending to their highest point. Thus we have the break of Antipholus of Ephesus with.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

If we can assume that this play as we have it in the Folio text shows signs of catering to an audience at least as learned as the playwright, then awareness of specific audience and perhaps also of the specific occasion of the Christmas revels at Gray&rsquo;s Inn in December, 1594, encouraged Shakespeare to indulge in authorial virtuosity..&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

But the gold chain behaves in a way alien to the solidity from which it is fashioned. It eludes its true owner, it leads to all kinds of mistakes, and the man to whom it is given in error enjoys it as one of a number of things of whose existence he is doubtful. In fact, though Antipholus does not actually state it, the chain for him is fairy-gold and might wither away to nothing at any moment. No sooner has the wrong Antipholus got the chain than (IV, i) we see a merchant pressing the goldsmith for a debt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [quotes <a href=""#tln_0997"" class=""ref lb"">997&ndash;1000</a>]. The rope is a substitute for the chain he would have [<i>66</i>] given, had his wife behaved herself.

As gold keeps on attaching itself to Antipholus of Syracuse, so ropes attach themselves, metaphorically and literally, to Antipholus of Ephesus.

But our sympathy with the speaker is overtopped by amusement at her mood of angry exaggeration. She is far from being a wretched soul bruised with adversity [<a href=""#tln_0308"" class=""ref lb"">308</a>]. Her only real woe, here, is that her husband is very late for dinner. To be sure, she hints that he may be with another woman (line [<a href=""#tln_0304"" class=""ref lb"">304</a>]). But this suspicion, entirely unfounded so far as the audience knows, is very faint and transient. All the more comical, therefore, is her great blaze of jealousy (lines [<a href=""#tln_0363"" class=""ref lb"">363</a>] ff.) when the strange demeanour of Antipholus of Syracuse, mistaken for her husband, has been reported to her. At this juncture the device of mistaken identity is superbly used for comedy of character. Antipholus of Syracuse, unlike his jaunty brother, is gravely moral. When finally he enters Adriana&rsquo;s presence and she regards him as Antipholus of Ephesus, he is exactly the man to look strange and frown ([<a href=""#tln_0505"" class=""ref lb"">505</a>]). No wonder his bearing turns Adriana&rsquo;s suspicion into a settled con-&shy;[<i>101</i>]viction. But now comes the finest stroke of all. Confronted with real trouble,.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as she believes, in her husband&rsquo;s life, her better nature comes to the fore. She drops her initial notion ([<a href=""#tln_0284"" class=""ref lb"">284</a>]) that her own way of life should, by rights, be as free as her husband&rsquo;s. She maintains indeed that there should be (in modern parlance) a single standard for both the sexes but she urges passionately that it should be pure and high [quotes <a href=""#tln_0519"" class=""ref lb"">519&ndash;39</a>]. How direct and powerful is the style here over against the neat, conventional rhetoric of the preceding quotation! This is one of the many instances.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where Shakespeare&rsquo;s good luck or good revision, or both, enables him to sharpen the style in accordance with the emotion. Here the pathos, by itself, would be too keen for comedy. But it is checked, for us, even as Adriana speaks, by the amazed looks of her two Syracusan listeners, wondering what it is all about; and it is submerged by the mirth, madder than ever, that ensues. </p>"

She has conned lessons of connubial discretion in an excellent school&mdash;the house of her married sister, Adriana. She has learned forbearance from observing the other&rsquo;s intolerance; she has acquired the art of making allowance, from noting her sister&rsquo;s exacting impatience; she grows confirmed in smooth acquiescence, from seeing the folly as well as misery of irritable and irritating opposition..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. While Adriana frets and fumes, Luciana gathers composure and a philosophy of obedience. Their first colloquy shows this characteristically: the one all heat and anger, the other all coolness and propriety. Shakespeare.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has made Luciana.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such a woman as would make one of those wives considered by common-minded men as model wives; that is, obedient and fawning wives. Luciana is calculating, submissive, and shrewdly obedient. She is ultra-passive outwardly, while inwardly maintaining a perfectly self-satisfied independence of opinion. Moreover, like all those women of systematic yieldingness rather than rational yieldingness, Luciana is given to palter with truth. It follows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that a woman who makes to herself a law, a mere calculating law, of blind and prone submission as the best course for her own interest, inevitably becomes, if not a liar, yet an equivocator, a sophisticator, a prevaricator, in some way a deviator from straightforward truth. All the little shifts and evasions; the paltry tricks and petty artifices; the carnying deceptions; the amiable falsifyings which women who adopt implicit obedience as their stock in trade in wedlock allow themselves, are the necessary growth of the course they pursue. Artful speech [<i>526</i>] and conduct are sure to proceed from forced and unnatural compliance; and uniform compliance is unnatural..&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

It is indeed Adriana who speaks with the voice of to-day in these matters. Why should man&rsquo;s liberty than our&rsquo;s be more? [284, slightly misquoted] she asks her sister, adding that none but asses will be bridled in such fashion by their husbands&rsquo; will.

There is no reason why Luce should not come into the presence of the on-stage party, but it is necessary that the Dromios should be kept apart, and that Adriana should not confront her real husband at this stage of the play.

Nelson judges that the stages in Cambridge were six feet high, but might vary from hall to hall. The space in front of the stage between the fireplace and the hall screen, with the scaffolding aligned along both sides, was left open for the frequent dancing that formed part of the revelry. Such a position for the stage meant that at least half the audience saw the play from the rear, though the height of the scaffolding where they sat (to the top of the House) improved sight lines; besides, actors were accustomed to playing to three or four sides of the public stage. Entrance to the stage could be through the door at the right rear of the half-pace, though actors would have to squeeze past the audience seated around the prince; or through the doors in the screen, forcing them to walk half the length of the hall and climb to the stage.

At times they seem some distance apart, at times they are close together, if not in the same locality..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have come to the conclusion that the most satisfactory arrangement for a modern reader&rsquo;s text is to alternate between two localities: (i) an open space before the house of Antipholus, which will have the priory on one side and a street-exit on the other, and (ii) the Mart, which will have the Courtesan&rsquo;s house in the centre and street-exits, one of them leading to the bay, on either side. We believe too that those responsible for the text, as we have it, kept those two localities more or less in mind, distinguishing them at the time of performance by means of placards, when necessary. Evidently the play was to be acted upon a simple platform with three doors at the back, and no inner-stage. He goes through the scenes, showing what placards would have to be erected. Possibly the three doors.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. were simply the entrances to the painted houses which are known to have been used on the academic and court stage; [<i>82</i>] but it is not necessary to our argument to suppose this, since the bare dais of a hall, with three doors at the back, would serve..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The obvious necessity for an upper-stage in 3.1., a scene which must have lost much of its effect when played in a hall without a gallery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suggest[s] that [Sh.] had the ordinary Elizabethan stage in mind throughout. (P. 98, on <a href=""#tln_0679"" class=""ref lb"">679</a>): In a public playhouse, for which this scene is clearly arranged, S. Dromio would be within i.e. behind the door or curtain at the back of the inner-stage, while Luce and Adriana would appear on the balcony which overhangs the inner-stage. All previous edd. have placed the two women within with S. Dromio. Such an arrangement is extremely awkward from the theatrical point of view, since the audience would be greatly puzzled by three unseen characters, more especially as one of them appears nowhere else in the play. Luce and Adriana, on the upper-stage, could be seen by the audience without themselves seeing E. Dromio and E. Antipholus, who would be at the door out of sight under the balcony. On the other hand at a performance such as that at Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where no inner-stage and probably no balcony would be available, the three characters would have to be within. Gray&rsquo;s Inn hall has a balcony over the screen end, but Wilson seems to envision the dais as the stage. Gray&rsquo;s Inn hall has only a single door opening to the dais.</p>"

What attracts Shakespeare to such a setting is not the verisimilar scenic effect&mdash;there is no indication that scenery or stage housing was used in the original production&mdash;but rather the spatial interconnection of the main stage and the space lying within. The stage fa&ccedil;ade becomes a part of Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedy of illusion and misunderstanding, much as it must have done on Plautus&rsquo; and Terence&rsquo;s stage before him.

The first recorded performance of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is that at Gray&rsquo;s Inn on 28 Dec., Holy Innocents&rsquo; Day, 1594, recorded in the <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>, which was published in 1688. In May and June 1594 the Admiral&rsquo;s men and the Chamberlain&rsquo;s men were formed to make some order out of the chaotic playing conditions caused in part by the extended closure of the London acting houses during the plague of mid 1592&ndash;mid 1594. The Admiral&rsquo;s company played at court on 28 Dec. (<a href=""#b_chae1923"" class=""ref bibl"">Chambers</a>, 1923, 4:109), freeing Sh.&rsquo;s company, themselves at court on the two previous nights, to play at Gray&rsquo;s Inn. <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> implies that the actors were called on the spur of the moment to calm what looked to be turning into a riot. If so, what good fortune to have a short Plautine comedy at hand. Here is the report of the event (ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 29&ndash;34): The next grand Night was intended to be upon <i>Innocents-Day</i> at Night; at which time there was a great Presence of Lords, Ladies, and worshipful Personages, that did expect some notable Performance at that time; which, indeed, had been effected, if the multitude of Beholders had not been so exceeding great, that thereby there was no convenient room for those that were Actors; by reason whereof, very good Inventions and Conceipts could not have opportunity to be applauded, which otherwise would have been great Contentation to the Beholders. About 9:00 p.m. the Inner Temple sent an ambassador with a large entourage to pay a formal visit to the mock prince of Purpoole, Henry Helmes, a law student, and was conducted to a (p. 30) Chair besides His Highness, to the end that he might be Partaker of the Sports intended. Polite speeches followed, emphasizing the long friendship between the Temple and Gray&rsquo;s Inn.</p>"
1,0,1,0,"<p xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" class=""noindent"">How to understand these events? On 28 Dec. a notable Performance was made impossible because worshipful Personages and Gentlewomen invaded the specially erected stage to such a degree that there was no convenient room for those that were Actors; the Templarian guests took offense and departed; order was mostly restored, and dancing and reveling, followed by a performance of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, were substituted, substitutions that were not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. any thing of Account in comparison to what had been planned. The Actors seem not to be the same as the Players, later called a Company of base and common Fellows, though it is just possible that the notable Performance was <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, not substituted but merely delayed until the rather small stage could be cleared for performance (<a href=""#b_smib1997"" class=""ref bibl"">Smith</a> [1997, p. 102]: The first recorded performance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. almost didn&rsquo;t happen).

Or is the whole account a fiction, one that pretends there was such mismanagement and such good fortune, followed by a mock arraignment and freeing of the prisoner?

More important is the fact that <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> and the <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> that occasioned its first recorded performance constitute.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a single piece of social process. He studies the two documents to show them as describing a rite of passage involving such matters as adolescent anxieties about identity, the emphasis in both on sexuality, and adult assurances, including (p. 118) in the end, both play and pageants find a place for women that supports rather than threatens male identity. <a href=""#b_kina1999"" class=""ref bibl"">Kinney</a> (1999, pp. 321, 323), commenting on <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>: This passage [quoted from pp. 31&ndash;2 above] has long been interpreted as a factual account.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ; but there is at least another reading possible: that Confusion was the theme and the whole evening performed as planned.

1,0,1,0,"<p xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" class=""noindent"">An alternative is to say this was all scripted, including a near riot that did not occur, a display of Templarian anger that never happened, and a planned performance of <i>Err.</i> to an audience so suitable for it that many have proposed that the play was written for Gray&rsquo;s Inn (though not necessarily for these revels, which seem to have been determined on only some two weeks before it was played).

But over time conventional spaces have developed. With the establishment of movable scenery following the Restoration, the painted flats and drops follow the same pattern until the rise of elaborate fixed sets in the 1870s. Prompt-books and playbooks describe the scenery, even stipulating into which grooves the flats were to be placed. The play now requires a throne room, a street in the mart, a chamber in E. Antipholus&rsquo;s house, and the exterior of the priory. For Hull&rsquo;s version, there has to be a garden, and, under the influence of Reynolds&rsquo;s staging, a chamber in the priory for the revised conclusion.

Aiming at an Ephesus where the strangest things could happen, Nagle Jackson in 1970 [Oregon Sh.

Modern dress also has been tried, as in John Bell&rsquo;s Australian production of 1978, set in the clearly cosmopolitan city of Ephesus..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trevor Nunn created a loosely defined modern setting that suggested anywhere from Turkey to Las Vegas. The 1920s were the background for Bill Cain&rsquo;s 1980 Boston Shakespeare Company version: strobe lights, barbershop quartets, and costumes made of long-johns.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tickled many funny bones. That same year Paul Barry&rsquo;s New Jersey staging found the Mardi Gras in a 1920s New Orleans a congenial setting; a wild assortment of costumes was thus justified.

We know, because Egeon has told us, that there are two pairs of twins; we know why Antipholus of Syracuse is recognized by the citizens of Ephesus and that the reason has nothing to do with Ephesus&rsquo; reputation for sorcery nor is it a dream. But we also find that the overweening confidence with which we begin, knowing the answers, is shaken in the course of the play. Every time I watch the play, I end up forgetting which Dromio has been sent on which errand by which Antipholus..&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We are nearly as confused as the characters. When both Dromios are played by the same actor the audience&rsquo;s ability to be confused, a confusion that the play wants us to undergo, is simply evaded, evaded because the audience comes to follow actor, not role, Graham Turner not Dromio.</p>"

Antipholis, Adriana, Luciana, and Hermia, whose sole function is to sing Michael Arne&rsquo;s setting of Hull&rsquo;s Stray not to those distant plains, a pastoral wish that the beloved tarry here with me and love. This addition with its song presumably goes back to the 1762 <i>Twins</i> (above), since Arne died in 1784; for the 1779 revival, Charles Dibdin&rsquo;s setting was used (<a href=""#b_goob1991"" class=""ref bibl"">Gooch, Thatcher, et al.</a>, 1991, 1:197). The song is preceded by Adriana&rsquo;s asking S.

He goes on to describe the garden, These beauteous bowers, in nature&rsquo;s fragrance rich, the whole addition apparently concocted to employ pastoral scenery and the song.

Clarke prompt-book: When wanting to play the piece quickly this scene is cut to the entrance of Ant of S.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. beginning with Why how now Dromio [<a href=""#tln_0862"" class=""ref lb"">862</a>], a drastic cut that deletes the wooing of Luciana.</p>"

0,0,0,5,"<p xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" class=""noindent"">Hull now adds 3.3, the meeting between S. Antipholis and Angelo (<a href=""#tln_0956"" class=""ref lb"">956&ndash;72</a>), which cannot take place in the garden but rather requires a change of scenery. At the end of his 3.2 Hull, having cut Dromio&rsquo;s geography of Nell (<a href=""#tln_0889"" class=""ref lb"">889&ndash;927</a>), has Antipholis exit and lets Dromio conclude the scene with <a href=""#tln_0944"" class=""ref lb"">944&ndash;5</a>, As from a bear a man would run for life, | So I from her that swears she is my wife, and exit. His new scene begins with the entrance of Angelo greeting S. Antipholis (<a href=""#tln_0956"" class=""ref lb"">956</a>). The scene is required because the garden scenery (located in the sixth or last groove, noted in the prompt-books) has to be replaced by The Street scenery (located in the first or second grooves) so that the two can speak. This new scene requires that Antipholis exit and return immediately after Dromio&rsquo;s lines, unless Hull&rsquo;s Act 1 ends at Dromio&rsquo;s exit. This latter appears to be what happens. Kemble (1811) adds in his hand to the new entrance of Angelo and Antipholis and Dromio of Syracuse, plus the line <i>Ant. of Syr.</i> Haste to the port, and find me out some ship, before Angelo&rsquo;s greeting (<a href=""#tln_0956"" class=""ref lb"">956</a>). Kemble is elaborating the beginning of Sh.&rsquo;s Act 2. The scene ends with Antipholis&rsquo;s rewritten soliloquy praising Luciana, which concludes with Unwillingly I go&mdash;my wounded soul, | (Howe&rsquo;er from Ephesus my body part) | Lingers behind in Luciana&rsquo;s heart.</p>"

As we will see, Reynolds&rsquo;s prompt-book describes a pantomime between S. Dromio and Luce that marks the end of his Act 1. Act 2 (in a three-act version) begins with Dromio entering, repeating those two lines about running from a bear, and being sent off to the port. Act 2 ends at <a href=""#tln_1461"" class=""ref lb"">1461</a>, with a good deal of horseplay, recorded in the prompt-books, involving struggles between Pinch and the Syracusans, who enter at <a href=""#tln_1440"" class=""ref lb"">1440</a>. In fact, Cumberland&rsquo;s SD is <i>Dr. Pinch runs across from</i> R. <i>to</i> L. <i>after them</i>.

At the end of Sh&rsquo;s 4.1 he expands Dromio&rsquo;s speech about returning to Adriana&rsquo;s to get the purse of ducats; Dromio worries that Blowzabell, the renamed Dowsabell, may appear and fright me from my purpose. In Sh.&rsquo;s 4.2, after <a href=""#tln_1128"" class=""ref lb"">1128</a> Hull gives Luciana an expanded speech urging Adriana&rsquo;s patience while expressing admiration for S. Antipholis&rsquo;s person as a prelude to her accepting him at the end of the play. In 4.3, the meeting of the Courtesan/Lesbia with the Syracusan twins is greatly rewritten. Lines <a href=""#tln_1231"" class=""ref lb"">1231&ndash;63</a> are replaced with S. Antipholis&rsquo;s scolding her for her looseness: What more temptations? <br></br>Mistress, you do impeach your modesty, <br></br>Here in the street to commit yourself <br></br>Into the hands of one who knows you not. The Placides give us stage business to accompany her entrance: Fondling around his neck. As the Syracusans move to leave her, she follows, and Dromio turns on her: No, you don&rsquo;t.

And now let&rsquo;s go hand in hand, not one before the other (<a href=""#tln_1910"" class=""ref lb"">1910&ndash;18</a>), followed by their exit into the Abbey, for which Reynolds writes a final scene that preserves most of Hull&rsquo;s sentimental conclusion. This restoration leads to greatly enhanced business for the Dromios. The most elaborate prompt-book description is the Placides&rsquo;. The two Dromios at extreme corners Look at each other and turn away laughing&mdash;Approach each other C. and stepping in the same manner. When near each other, both burst out laughing and run back to proceniums [i.e., the proscenium doors]. Both advance again to centre. They put up L. foot and laugh&mdash;they put up R. foot in same manner. Dromio of E. looks at himself from head to foot, Turns his brother round to look at him, and then giggles to himself&mdash;same business with Dromio of S. The dialogue ensues, then They place hands on each other&rsquo;s shoulders, and go up as the others advance. The two Dromios change smiles at back, and come down extreme corners. Even this business evolves; J. S. Clarke gives part of it: at <a href=""#tln_1909"" class=""ref lb"">1909</a> [Dromios] who have been asleep R &amp; L Now gradually awake&mdash;yawn&mdash;both X to C &amp; up not seeing each other &amp; at the [proscenium] door as they are about to enter, see each other&mdash;start&mdash;, come down C&mdash;look at each other&mdash;the[y] embrace &amp; look together. Finally, the whole business becomes clear in the Crane &amp; Robson prompt-book, 1878: at <a href=""#tln_1775"" class=""ref lb"">1775&ndash;6</a> during this Dromio of Ephesus has gone to sleep L[eft].

The most startling cut, considering that the passage has drawn the most academic comment, is that of S. Antipholis&rsquo;s water-drop speech (<a href=""#tln_0199"" class=""ref lb"">199&ndash;204</a>). Since the Placides played the Dromios, they may have thought that there was no need to make Antipholis needlessly interesting; they also take away his <a href=""#tln_1187"" class=""ref lb"">1187&ndash;94</a>. They cut the redundancy of <a href=""#tln_0255"" class=""ref lb"">255</a>, which repeats <a href=""#tln_0254"" class=""ref lb"">254</a>. Nearly like Smock Alley, they cut E.

Cutting Pinch&rsquo;s diagnosis of E. Antipholis as being possessed and needing to be tied up in a dark room (<a href=""#tln_1380"" class=""ref lb"">1380&ndash;2</a>) may reflect current medical practice. They are the only ones to cut all of <a href=""#tln_1406"" class=""ref lb"">1406&ndash;39</a>&mdash;others cut bits and pieces&mdash;a passage that requires a lot of the cast to be onstage in very busy action at the end of Act 4. The Abbess&rsquo;s refusal to turn E. Antipholis over to Adriana until she has cured him (<a href=""#tln_1572"" class=""ref lb"">1572&ndash;6</a>; Smock Alley cuts <a href=""#tln_1575"" class=""ref lb"">1575&ndash;81</a>) may have seemed too detailed, though it is part of the other cuts having to do with illness, or perhaps it is just in the tradition of reducing the Abbess&rsquo;s importance. The Placides are alone in cutting &AElig;geon&rsquo;s misery at not being recognized by the Ephesian twins (<a href=""#tln_1774"" class=""ref lb"">1774&ndash;88a</a>). One wonders whether the lines are expendably long, susceptible of misplaced laughter rather than pity, or what.

In the center of the stage is the abbey, with the clock, flanked on stage left by the Phoenix, Pinch&rsquo;s house, the Tiger Inn, a pawn shop (the usurer&rsquo;s, designated the 4th Merchant in SPs), Balthazar&rsquo;s house, and the Porcupine, and on the right by the Centaur, a tailor&rsquo;s house, an unmarked door, a fish stall (5th Merchant), and Angelo&rsquo;s house. The Phoenix and the Porcupine have windows, used prominently. Ranged before the houses are three squat blocks used as seats. Sh.&rsquo;s cast has been fleshed out with a tailor, innkeeper, three policemen, two sailors, two ladies, and the extra merchants. Luce is always called Nell. These extras groan, sigh, and murmur during the long speeches in the first and final acts. They are also given portions of the long speeches (e.g., <a href=""#tln_1588"" class=""ref lb"">1588&ndash;97</a> are divided among the fourth Merchant, Balthazar, Angelo, Courtesan, the fifth Merchant, the tailor, and the first Merchant).
