Preface

The title page tells part of the story of my indebtedness to two men who worked on this edition until their deaths. The Comedy of Errors took up much of T. W. Baldwin’s professional life, as the bibliography shows. Baldwin completed a draft of the commentary notes, based on his reading about the play from the earliest commentaries until about the middle of the twentieth century, when his interest in keeping current seems to have waned. He does systematically quote R. A. Foakes’s 1962 Arden edition. After Baldwin’s death, John Hazel Smith, his former student and a professor at Brandeis University, took over as editor. Smith assembled a rich bibliography and obtained photocopies of most of the entries. He also collated the editions listed in the Plan of the Work from 1623 to 1974, that is, from the First Folio to the Riverside edition of G. B. Evans, and he drafted the historical collation under the eyes of the general editors, Robert K. Turner and Richard Knowles. At Smith’s untimely death, then, much of the groundwork for the present edition had been completed, and I here express my gratitude for Baldwin’s and Smith’s labors; indeed, I would not have undertaken completing this edition if I had had to start from scratch.

I also wish to acknowledge the help of Denise Lamb, who assisted me at the very start of the project and whose proofreading eye caught my mistakes through the drafting of the first version of the commentary notes; would that she had been able to continue her aid. Elizabeth Mermann helped with German texts, and Jennifer Perry located reviews of performances in the late 19th and the 20th century. The staffs at the Folger Library, Brandeis University, the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, and the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford-upon-Avon assisted me in countless ways. Memorial Library on the Madison campus of the University of Wisconsin (Kenneth L. Frazier, director of libraries) maintains the Shakespeare Collection of great riches for the use of Variorum editors. This bibliographical support has been invaluable, as has that of the Memorial Library reference librarians, whose counsel and friendship went further than even their ability to figure out what in the world I was asking about. Thanks also to Pamela E. Wilkinson, my copyeditor, who brought order to what turned out to be a pretty primitive manuscript.

The Graduate School, through its Research Committee, funded a research assistant, for which I am grateful.

My debt to the general editors, Robert K. Turner, Richard Knowles, and Paul Werstine, far exceeds what is recorded on these pages. Especially, Dick Knowles, my colleague and friend, found ways to organize the compound mass I periodically dropped on him. Kent Cartwright alerted me to several mistakes in the historical collation, generously providing corrections.

I am happy to say in print what I have been saying for half a century to Jane Henning: I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and hope she will not complete the quotation.

Standish Henning







Plan of the Work

This edition contains four principal parts: (1) the text of The Comedy of Errors reprinted from the First Folio edition of 1623; (2) textual notes of the few significant emendations of the F1 text that have been made, as well as all the departures from the text of F1 in all the important editions of the play since 1623; (3) comments on the text designed to explicate its language where explication is called for and to summarize the notes that a long succession of editors and commentators have written on it; and (4) an appendix in which certain general aspects of the play are reproduced or summed up and data and opinions whose bulk or length precludes their incorporation in the commentary are collected.

The text printed here is a modified diplomatic reprint of that in the Norton facsimile of F1 prepared by Charlton Hinman (1968), checked against copy 53, the Urquhart-Wyndham copy, in the Folger Library. Press variants found in other copies are recorded in the appendix. The reprint does not reproduce typographical features such as the long s, display and swash letters, ornaments, and rules; abbreviations printed as one letter above another are printed as two consecutive letters, the second one superscript. Minor typographical blemishes such as irregular spacing; printing space-types; and wrong-font, damaged, turned, transposed, misprinted, or missing letters and punctuation marks have been corrected, usually silently. If, however, the anomaly is likely to have any bibliographical significance, its correction is recorded in the appendix. Where the error is not clearly typographical or where the correction is not an obvious one, the text has been left unaltered and various emendations have been recorded in the textual notes. When emendation of an obvious typographical error has resulted in a change from one word to another, the emendation has been treated as being substantive and has been recorded in the textual notes; otherwise, no substantive emendation or semisubstantive change of an accidental detail has been made in the text. The F1 lineation of both verse and prose has been preserved, except that the turned-over and turned-under lines have been printed continuously and such alteration has been recorded in the appendix. In general, the attempt has been made to omit and ignore all insignificant typographical peculiarities but to retain or at least record any accidental details of possible textual significance.

Through Line Numbers (TLNs) are printed by fives in the right margin; these numbers are used for all notes and cross-references in the edition. Inclusive act-scene-line numbers as determined in G. B. Evans’s Riverside edition (1974) are supplied in arabic numerals in the headline of each page of text, and Riverside act-and-scene division is indicated by boldface arabic numerals in the right margin. The beginning of each Folio column is marked outside the margins by signature-and-column indicators in parentheses.

The textual notes are based on a collation of the following editions. Each entry below is preceded by the siglum that represents that edition in the textual notes. These editions have been fully collated, letter and point. The place of publication is not mentioned when it is London.

A conjectural emendation is recorded in the textual notes only if an editor subsequently printed such a reading in the text; in these cases the earliest known instance of the conjecture that might have been known to the editor is recorded in the note. When the editor’s emendation differs in minor details of spelling or punctuation from the conjecture as originally proposed, the note records only the editor’s version, since this form was usually imitated by subsequent editors. A few unadopted conjectures of special interest are discussed in the commentary notes; all other unadopted conjectures and all that are merely duplicates of earlier conjectures are listed in the appendix. Manuscript conjectures, including J. P. Collier’s forgeries in the Perkins Folio, are ignored unless known to have been adopted or noted by an editor. The alterations of the text in printed acting versions and in prompt-books are discussed in a separate part of the appendix.

The textual notes record substantive or semisubstantive variants from the Variorum text in the editions fully collated—that is, either substitutions, additions, or reorderings of words or passages or else such changes of details of spelling, punctuation, typography, spacing, and lineation as significantly affect meaning or meter.

(1) Verbal variants: Misprints go unnoticed unless they create a word in the English vocabulary or appear to have been taken for a legitimate word by being repeated in one or more of the four Shakespeare Folios. Variant or modernized spellings are ignored; however, in doubtful cases variants possibly of this sort are included if the Oxford English Dictionary gives them a separate listing.

(2) Punctuation: Variant punctuation is recorded only when meaning is affected. Thus the fact that in various editions an independent clause ends with a comma, semicolon, colon, dash, or period is ignored if the meaning of the sentence or speech is unchanged thereby except in minor degrees of pace or emphasis, whereas a change from comma to semicolon that alters meaning is recorded. Similarly, there is no record that an obviously rhetorical question is marked with a period in some texts, but a period that distinguishes between a declarative and an interrogative sentence is recorded.

(3) Lining and meter: Variant lining that affects meter—that is, the relining of verse as prose, of prose as verse, or of verse as different verse—is recorded. The elision or expansion of syllables for metrical purposes or the addition of diacritical marks to locate accent is recorded only if the alteration displaces the accent from one syllable to another or changes the number of metrical feet in a line—that is, if it significantly affects the meter rather than merely makes the metrical pattern more obvious.

Variants in the accessories are recorded somewhat more selectively than those in the text proper.

(1) Added stage directions that describe action clearly implied by the text are ignored, as are directions for insignificant bits of stage business or those intended merely as props to a reader’s imagination. Variants that affect only secondary details of a stage direction are also ignored; in some cases the abbreviation subst. is employed to indicate substantial agreement among editions despite differences of detail. All differences about who enters or exits, about when he or she does so, or about stage business that affects the interpretation of a speech or scene are recorded.

(2) Only those variant speech prefixes that imply disagreement as to the identity of the speaker are recorded; variants in the form or spelling of the prefix are ignored. Variant scene divisions and numberings are recorded, but not alternative ways of recording these differences. Added and variant indications of locale are recorded, but not the different ways of indicating and particularizing the same place.

A variant reading in the textual notes appears in the form printed in the first edition to adopt that reading; insignificant variations in the spelling, punctuation, typography, spacing, and lineation of the reading in later editions are not recorded. Thus a variant given as I, F3+ does not imply that all editions from F3 onwards print I in precisely that form: later renderings of the reading may be spelled Ay or punctuated Ay; or Ay., but as these variations do not affect the meaning they are not recorded. When a variant is only a matter of the punctuation after a word, the word in the lemma is not repeated in the note but is replaced by the lemma sign ( ~ ), and the absence of punctuation in either lemma or variant is indicated by a caret (‸). Thus looke‸ heere.]  ~ ,  ~ ? F2-F4 indicates that F2, F3, and F4 differ significantly from F1 at this point only in adding a comma after looke and in substituting a question mark after heere.

Four kinds of formulas are used in the textual notes as space-saving devices to avoid listing a long series of sigla for editions that agree on a reading:

(1) When all editions after a certain one agree with that edition, the agreement is shown by a plus sign after its siglum. Thus rowe1+ means that all editions fully collated from Rowe’s first edition of 1709 through Bevington’s edition of 1988 agree with Rowe’s text at this point.

(2) The abbreviation etc. after a siglum for an edition means that all editions fully collated that are not otherwise accounted for in the note agree with that edition. Thus hers] Ff, kit1, ard2; theirs rowe1 etc. means that every edition but the four Folios and the editions of Kittredge and Foakes agrees with rowe1.

(3) The agreement of three or more editions in chronological succession is indicated by a hyphen between the sigla of the first and last edition in the series. Thus pope1-john1 indicates the agreement of all fully collated editions from Pope’s first edition to Johnson’s first edition.

(4) The agreement of a family of related editions—that is, editions by the same editor or bearing the same name—is indicated by the siglum root for that family. Thus theo indicates agreement of all editions by Theobald (theo1, theo2, etc.) that were fully collated, cam the agreement of all Cambridge editions fully collated.

A siglum printed in parentheses and with a minus sign after any of the first three of the above kinds of formulae indicates an exceptional edition in the succession whose text agrees with F1 rather than with the variant in question. Thus rowe1+ (−rid, sis) indicates the agreement of all editions from rowe1 onwards except those of Ridley and Sisson, which agree with F1.

To facilitate the interpretation of the formulae—for example, to enable the reader to see quickly which fully collated editions are included in such a formula as stau−sis—a chronological list of sigla is provided on the paste-down papers inside the front and back covers of this edition. An alphabetical list of sigla on the facing pages both identifies the editors and gives the date whereby any siglum may be located in the chronological list.

The Commentary seeks not only to elucidate the text but also at times to trace the history of the criticism to which the word or passage has been subjected. It includes only a selection from all that has been written about this play, and the responsibility for the selection is the editor’s. The critical stance is historical and neutral, although occasionally perceived flaws that damage the critic’s argument are noted.

All words and phrases that the Oxford English Dictionary describes as not in current standard use are defined, and all passages that are annotated by a number of commentators are annotated here. (The dagger and obs. used by OED to indicate obsolete senses have been omitted.)

All quotations are enclosed in quotation marks (to set them off from paraphrase) and are reproduced as in the source, except that titles of books and plays enclosed in quotation marks are printed in italics. Omissions within quotations are indicated by ellipsis points; when such omissions remove the beginning or end of a sentence but still leave a sentence complete in itself, that remaining sentence is silently given an initial capital letter. Quotations made by commentators have been verified and, where necessary, corrected within square brackets. The commentators’ references to passages in this play by act, scene, and line have been replaced by Through Line Numbers (TLNs) within brackets, and quotations of more than a few words have generally been omitted and replaced by a cross-reference of TLNs in brackets to the appropriate passage in this edition. In references to Shakespeare’s other plays, Riverside act-scene-line numbers are followed by TLNs within parentheses or brackets. Quotations from Shakespeare’s Poems or Sonnets are made to conform to the texts in the New Variorum edition, and those from the plays to the most authoritative Folio or Quarto text; specifically, the following plays are quoted from the best quarto rather than from F1: Ado, 1H4, 2H4 (+F1), Ham. (+F1), LLL, Lr. (+F1), MND, MV, Oth. (+F1), Per., R2 (+F1), Rom., Tit. (+F1), TNK, and Tro. All biblical quotations are printed in the language of the Geneva Bible (1560) unless some other version is specified.

The notes printed in the Commentary are as a rule identified only by the commentator’s last name and the date of the article or book; further information is given only when two or more works of the same date are drawn upon. Full identification will be found in the bibliography or in the list of editions consulted that is printed above. Since arabic numerals are used in preference to roman numerals wherever possible, volume-and-page citations appear in the form 39:256 instead of XXXIX, 256. All statements in the Commentary not otherwise assigned and all information within square brackets [ ] are the contribution of the editor. When square brackets appear in the work quoted, they have been changed to pointed brackets &lt; &gt;.

                                Siracusians and our selues, To admit no trafficke to our aduerse townes: Nay more, if any borne at
                                Ephesus
                            Be seene at any Siracusian
                            Marts and Fayres: Againe, if any
                                Siracusian borne Come to
                            the Bay of Ephesus, he dies: His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose, Vnlesse a thousand markes be leuied To quit the penalty, and to ransome him:
                                Thy substance, valued at the highest
                            rate, Cannot amount vnto a hundred Markes,
                                Therefore by Law thou art condemn’d to
                            die.
                    

                    
                    
                        Mer.
                        Yet this my comfort, when your words are done, My woes end likewise with the euening Sonne.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duk.
                        Well Siracusian; say in briefe the cause Why thou departedst from thy natiue home?
                                And for what cause thou cam’st to
                                Ephesus.
                    

                    
                    
                        Mer.
                        A heauier taske could not haue beene impos’d, Then I to speake my griefes vnspeakeable: Yet that the world may witnesse that my
                            end Was wrought by nature, not by vile
                            offence, Ile vtter what my sorrow giues me
                            leaue. In
                                Syracusa was I borne, and wedde Vnto a woman, happy but for me, And by me; had not our hap beene bad: With her I liu’d in ioy, our wealth increast By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamium, till my factors
                            death, And he great care of goods at
                            randone left, Drew me from kinde
                            embracements of my spouse; From whom my
                            absence was not sixe moneths olde, Before
                            her selfe (almost at fainting vnder (H1b)
                            The pleasing punishment
                            that women beare) Had made prouision for
                            her following me, And soone, and safe,
                            arriued where I was: There had she not
                            beene long, but she became A ioyfull
                            mother of two goodly sonnes: And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
                                As could not be distinguish’d but by
                            names. That very howre, and in the
                            selfe-same Inne, A meane woman was
                            deliuered Of such a burthen Male, twins
                            both alike: Those, for
                            their parents were exceeding poore, I
                            bought, and brought vp to attend my sonnes. My wife, not meanely prowd of two such boyes, Made daily motions for our home returne: Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too soone wee
                            came aboord. A league
                            from Epidamium had we saild Before the alwaies winde-obeying deepe Gaue any Tragicke Instance of our harme: But longer did we not retaine much hope; For what obscured light the heauens did grant, Did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes
                                A doubtfull warrant of immediate
                            death, Which though my selfe would gladly
                            haue imbrac’d, Yet the incessant weepings
                            of my wife, Weeping before for what she
                            saw must come, And
                            pitteous playnings of the prettie babes That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to feare, Forst me to seeke delayes for them and me,
                                And this it was: (for other meanes was
                            none) The Sailors sought for safety by our
                            boate, And left the ship
                            then sinking ripe to vs. My wife, more
                            carefull for the latter borne, Had fastned
                            him vnto a small spare Mast, Such as
                            sea-faring men prouide for stormes: To him
                            one of the other twins was bound, Whil’st I had beene like heedfull of the other.
                                The children thus dispos’d, my wife
                            and I, Fixing our eyes on whom our care
                            was fixt, Fastned our selues at eyther end
                            the mast, And floating straight, obedient
                            to the streame, Was
                            carried towards Corinth, as we thought. At length the sonne gazing vpon the earth,
                                Disperst those vapours that offended
                            vs, And by the benefit of his wished light
                                The seas waxt calme, and we discouered
                                Two shippes from
                            farre, making amaine to vs: Of
                                Corinth that, of Epidarus this, But ere they came, oh let me say no more,
                                Gather the sequell by that went
                            before.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duk.
                        Nay forward old man, doe not breake off so, (H1va)
                            For we may pitty, though
                            not pardon thee.
                    

                    
                    
                        Merch.
                        Oh had the gods done so, I had not now Worthily tearm’d them mercilesse to vs: For ere the ships could meet by twice fiue leagues, We were encountred by a mighty rocke, Which being violently
                            borne vp, Our helpefull ship was splitted
                            in the midst; So that in this vniust
                            diuorce of vs, Fortune had left to both
                            of vs alike, What to delight in, what to
                            sorrow for, Her part,
                            poore soule, seeming as burdened With
                            lesser waight, but not with lesser woe, Was carried with more speed before the winde, And in our sight they three were taken vp By Fishermen of Corinth, as
                            we thought. At length
                            another ship had seiz’d on vs, And
                            knowing whom it was their hap to saue, Gaue healthfull welcome to their ship-wrackt guests, And would haue reft the Fishers of their
                            prey, Had not their backe beene very slow
                            of saile; And therefore
                            homeward did they bend their course. Thus
                            haue you heard me seuer’d from my blisse, That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d, To tell sad stories of my owne mishaps.

                        And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, Doe me the fauour to dilate at full, What haue befalne of them and they till
                            now.

                        My yongest boy, and yet my eldest care, At
                            eighteene yeeres became inquisitiue After
                            his brother; and importun’d me That his attendant, so his case was like, Reft of his brother, but retain’d his
                            name, Might beare him company in the
                            quest of him: Whom whil’st I laboured of
                            a loue to see, I hazarded the losse of
                            whom I lou’d. Fiue
                            Sommers haue I spent in farthest Greece, Roming cleane through the bounds of
                                Asia, And coasting
                            homeward, came to Ephesus: Hopelesse to finde, yet loth to leaue vnsought Or that, or any place that harbours men: But heere must end the
                            story of my life, And happy were I in my
                            timelie death, Could all my trauells
                            warrant me they liue.

                                Now trust me, were
                            it not against our Lawes, Against my

                            Princes would they may not disanull, My
                            soule should sue as aduocate for thee: But though thou art adiudged to the death, And passed sentence may not be recal’d But to our honours great disparagement:

                                Therefore Marchant, Ile limit thee
                            this day To seeke thy helpe by
                            beneficiall helpe, Try
                            all the friends thou hast in Ephesus, Beg thou, or borrow, to make vp the summe, And liue: if no, then thou art doom’d to

                            apprehended for a riuall here, And not
                            being able to buy out his life, According
                            to the statute of the towne, Dies ere the

                        Goe beare it to the Centaure, where we host, And stay there Dromio, till I come to thee;
                                Within this houre it will be dinner
                            time, Till that Ile view the manners of
                            the towne, Peruse the

                            then returne and sleepe within mine Iune, For with long trauaile I am stiffe and wearie. Get thee away.

                        Many a man would take you at your word, And goe indeede, hauing so good a meane.
                    

                    
                    Exit Dromio.

                        A trustie villaine sir, that very oft, When I am dull with care and melancholly, Lightens my humour with his merry iests: What will you walke with
                            me about the towne, And then goe to my

                        I am inuited sir to certaine Marchants, Of
                            whom I hope to make much benefit: I craue
                            your pardon, soone at fiue a clocke, Please you, Ile meete with you vpon the Mart, And afterward consort you till bed time:

                        Ant.
                        Farewell till then: I will goe loose my selfe, And wander vp and downe to view the Citie.

                        Sir, I commend you to your owne content.

                        He that commends me to mine owne content, Commends me to the thing I cannot get: I to the world am like a drop of water, That in the Ocean seekes another drop, Who falling there to finde his fellow
                            forth, (Vnseene, inquisitiue) confounds
                            himselfe. So I, to finde a Mother and a
                            Brother, In quest of them (vnhappie a)
                            loose my selfe. Enter Dromio of
                                    Ephesus.
                            Here comes the almanacke of my true date:
                                What now? How chance thou art
                            return’d so soone.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        Return’d so soone, rather approacht too late: The Capon burnes, the Pig fals from the spit; The clocke hath strucken
                            twelue vpon the bell: My Mistris made it
                            one vpon my cheeke: She is so hot because
                            the meate is colde: The meate is colde,
                            because you come not home: You come not
                            home, because you haue no stomacke: You haue no stomacke, hauing broke your fast: But we that know what ’tis to fast and
                            pray, Are penitent for your default to
                            day.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Stop in your winde sir, tell me this I pray? Where haue you left the mony that I gaue you.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        Oh sixe pence that I had a wensday last, To pay the Sadler for my Mistris crupper: The Sadler had it Sir, I kept it not.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        I am not in a sportiue humor now: Tell me,
                            and dally not, where is the monie? We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust So great a charge from thine owne
                            custodie.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        I pray you iest sir as you sit at dinner: I from my Mistris come to you in post: If I returne I shall be post indeede. (H2a)
                            For she will scoure your
                            fault vpon my pate: Me thinkes your maw,
                            like mine, should be your cooke, And
                            strike you home without a messenger.

                        Come Dromio, come, these iests are out of season, Reserue them till a merrier houre then
                            this: Where is the gold
                            I gaue in charge to thee?
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        To me sir? why you gaue no gold to me?
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Come on sir knaue, haue done your foolishnes, And tell me how thou hast dispos’d thy charge.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        My charge was but to fetch you frõ the Mart Home to your house, the Phœnix sir,
                            to dinner; My Mistris and her sister
                            staies for you.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Now as I am a Christian answer me, In what
                            safe place you haue bestow’d my monie; Or
                            I shall breake that merrie sconce of yours That stands on tricks, when I am vndispos’d: Where is the thousand Markes thou hadst
                            of me?
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        I haue some markes of yours vpon my pate: Some of my Mistris markes vpon my shoulders: But not a thousand markes betweene you both. If I should pay your
                            worship those againe, Perchance you will
                            not beare them patiently.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Thy Mistris markes? what Mistris slaue hast thou?
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        Your worships wife, my Mistris at the Phœnix; She that doth fast till you come home to
                            dinner: And praies that
                            you will hie you home to dinner.

                        What wilt thou flout me thus vnto my face Being forbid? There take you that sir knaue.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        What meane you sir, for God sake hold your hands: Nay, and you will not sir, Ile take my heeles.

                        Vpon my life by some deuise or other, The
                            villaine is ore-wrought of all my monie. They say this towne is full of cosenage: As nimble Iuglers that deceiue the eie: Darke working Sorcerers that change the minde: Soule-killing Witches, that deforme the
                            bodie: Disguised Cheaters, prating
                            Mountebankes; And manie such like
                            liberties of sinne: If it proue so, I
                            will be gone the sooner: Ile to the Centaur to goe seeke this slaue, I greatly feare my monie is not safe.

                    Actus Secundus.

                    
                    Enter Adriana, wife to
                            Antipholis Sereptus, with Luciana her Sister.

                    
                    
                        Adr.
                        Neither my husband nor the slaue return’d, That in such haste I sent to seeke his Master? Sure Luciana it is two a clocke.
                    

                    
                    
                        Luc.
                        Perhaps some Merchant hath inuited him, And from the Mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner: Good Sister let vs dine, and neuer fret;
                                A man is Master of his libertie: Time is their Master, and when they see
                            time, They’ll goe or come; if so, be
                            patient Sister.
                    

                    
                    
                        Adr.
                        Why should their libertie then ours be more?
                    

                    
                    
                        Luc.
                        Because their businesse still lies out adore.

                        Looke when I serue him so, he takes it thus.
                    

                    
                    
                        Luc.
                        Oh, know he is the bridle of your will.

                        There’s none but asses will be bridled so.

                        Why, headstrong liberty is lasht with woe: There’s nothing situate vnder heauens eye, But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in
                            skie. The beasts, the fishes, and the
                            winged fowles Are their males subiects,
                            and at their controules: Man more diuine,
                            the Master of all these, Lord of the wide world, and wilde watry seas, Indued with intellectuall sence and soules, Of more preheminence then fish and
                            fowles, Are masters to their females, and
                            their Lords: Then let your will attend on
                            their accords.

                        This seruitude makes you to keepe vnwed.

                        Not this, but troubles of the marriage bed.

                        But were you wedded, you wold bear some sway.

                        How if your husband start some other where?

                        Till he come home againe, I would forbeare.

                        Patience vnmou’d, no maruel though she pause, They can be meeke, that haue no other cause: A wretched soule bruis’d with aduersitie,
                                We bid be quiet when we heare it
                            crie. But were we
                            burdned with like waight of paine, As
                            much, or more, we should our selues complaine: So thou that hast no vnkinde mate to greeue thee, With vrging helpelesse patience would
                            releeue me; But if thou liue to see like
                            right bereft, This
                            foole-beg’d patience in thee will be left.

                        Well, I will marry one day but to trie: Heere comes your man, now is your husband nie.

                        Say, is your tardie master now at hand?

                        Say, didst thou speake with him? knowst thou his minde?

                            starke mad: When I desir’d him to come
                            home to dinner, He ask’d me for a hundred
                            markes in gold: ’Tis dinner time, quoth
                            I: my gold, quoth he: Your meat doth burne, quoth I: my gold quoth he: Will you come, quoth I: my gold, quoth he; Where is the thousand markes I gaue thee
                            villaine? The Pigge quoth I, is burn’d:
                            my gold, quoth he: My mistresse, sir,

                            conclusion, he did beat me there.

                        His company must do his minions grace, Whil’st I at home starue for a merrie looke: Hath homelie age th’alluring beauty tooke
                                From my poore cheeke? then he hath
                            wasted it. Are my discourses dull? Barren
                            my wit, If voluble and sharpe discourse
                            be mar’d, Vnkindnesse blunts it more then
                            marble hard. Doe their

                                Of my defeatures. My decayed faire,

                            detaine, So he would keepe faire quarter
                            with his bed: I see the

                            beautie: yet the gold bides still That
                            others touch, and often touching will, Where gold and no man that hath a name, By falshood and corruption doth it shame: Since that my beautie cannot please his
                            eie, Ile weepe (what’s left away) and

                        Your reason?
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Lest it make you chollericke, and purchase me another drie basting.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Well sir, learne to iest in good time, there’s a time for all things.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        I durst haue denied that before you vvere so chollericke.
                    

                    
                    
                        Anti.
                        By what rule sir?
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Marry sir, by a rule as plaine as the plaine bald pate of Father time himselfe.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Let’s heare it.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        There’s no time for a man to recouer his haire that growes bald by nature.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        May he not doe it by fine and recouerie?
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Yes, to pay a fine for a perewig, and recouer the lost haire of another man.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Why, is Time such a niggard of haire, being (as it is) so plentifull an excrement?
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Because it is a blessing that hee bestowes on beasts, and what he hath scanted them in haire, hee hath
                                giuen them in
                            wit.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Why, but theres manie a man hath more haire then wit.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his haire.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Why thou didst conclude hairy men plain dea­ lers without wit.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he loo­ seth it in a kinde of iollitie.
                    

                    
                    
                        An.
                        For what reason.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        For two, and sound ones to.
                    

                    (H3a)
                    
                    
                        An.
                        Nay not sound I pray you.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Sure ones then.
                    

                    
                    
                        An.
                        Nay, not sure in a thing falsing.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Certaine ones then.
                    

                    
                    
                        An.
                        Name them.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        The one to saue the money that he spends in trying: the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porrage.
                    

                    
                    
                        An.
                        You would all this time haue prou’d, there is no time for all things.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Marry and did sir: namely, in no time to re­ couer haire lost by Nature.
                    

                    
                    
                        An.
                        But your reason was not substantiall, why there is no time to recouer.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Thus I mend it: Time himselfe is bald, and therefore to the worlds end, will haue bald followers.
                    

                    
                    
                        An.
                        I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion: but soft, who wafts vs yonder.
                    

                    
                    Enter Adriana and
                            Luciana.

                    
                    
                        Adri.
                        I, I, Antipholus, looke strange and frowne, Some other Mistresse hath thy sweet
                            aspects: I am not Adriana,
                            nor thy wife. The time was once, when
                            thou vn-vrg’d wouldst vow, That neuer
                            words were musicke to thine eare, That neuer obiect pleasing in thine eye, That neuer touch well welcome to thy
                            hand, That neuer meat sweet-sauour’d in
                            thy taste, Vnlesse I spake, or look’d, or
                            touch’d, or caru’d to thee. How comes it
                            now, my Husband, oh how comes it, That thou art then estranged from thy selfe? Thy selfe I call it, being strange to me:
                                That vndiuidable Incorporate Am better then thy deere selfes better
                            part. Ah doe not teare away thy selfe
                            from me; For know my
                            loue: as easie maist thou fall A drop of
                            water in the breaking gulfe, And take
                            vnmingled thence that drop againe Without
                            addition or diminishing, As take from me
                            thy selfe, and not me too. How deerely would it touch thee to the quicke, Shouldst thou but heare I were
                            licencious? And that this body consecrate
                            to thee, By Ruffian Lust should be
                            contaminate? Wouldst thou not spit at me,
                            and spurne at me, And
                            hurle the name of husband in my face, And
                            teare the stain’d skin of my Harlot brow, And from my false hand cut the wedding ring, And breake it with a deepe-diuorcing vow? I know thou canst, and therefore see thou
                            doe it. I am possest
                            with an adulterate blot, My bloud is
                            mingled with the crime of lust: For if we
                            two be one, and thou play false, I doe
                            digest the poison of thy flesh, Being
                            strumpeted by thy contagion: Keepe then faire league and truce with thy true
                            bed, I liue distain’d, thou
                            vndishonoured.
                    

                    
                    
                        Antip.
                        Plead you to me faire dame? I know you not: In Ephesus I am but two houres old, As strange vnto your towne, as to your talke, Who euery word by all my
                            wit being scan’d, Wants wit in all, one
                            word to vnderstand.
                    

                    
                    
                        Luci.
                        Fie brother, how the world is chang’d with you: When were you wont to vse my sister thus? She sent for you by Dromio
                            home to dinner.

                        Ant.
                        By Dromio?
                    
                    
                        Drom.
                        By me.
                    

                    
                    
                        Adr.
                        By thee, and this thou didst returne from him. That he did buffet thee, and in his blowes, Denied my house for his, me for his
                            wife.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Did you conuerse sir with this gentlewoman: What is the course and drift of your compact?
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        I sir? I neuer saw her till this time.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Villaine thou liest, for euen her verie words, Didst thou deliuer to me on the Mart.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        I neuer spake with her in all my life.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        How can she thus then call vs by our names? Vnlesse it be by inspiration.
                    

                    
                    
                        Adri.
                        How ill agrees it with your grauitie, To
                            counterfeit thus grosely with your slaue, Abetting him to thwart me in my moode; Be it my wrong, you are from me exempt, But wrong not that wrong with a more
                            contempt. Come I will fasten on this
                            sleeue of thine: Thou art an Elme my
                            husband, I a Vine: Whose weaknesse
                            married to thy stranger state, Makes me with thy strength to communicate: If ought possesse thee from me, it is
                            drosse, Vsurping Iuie, Brier, or idle
                            Mosse, Who all for want of pruning, with
                            intrusion, Infect thy sap, and liue on
                            thy confusion.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        To mee shee speakes, shee moues mee for her theame; What, was
                            I married to her in my dreame? Or sleepe
                            I now, and thinke I heare all this? What
                            error driues our eies and eares amisse? Vntill I know this sure vncertaintie, Ile entertaine the free’d fallacie.

                        Dromio, goe bid the seruants spred for dinner.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Oh for my beads, I crosse me for a sinner. This is the Fairie land, oh spight of spights, We talke with Goblins, Owles and Sprights;
                                If we obay them not, this will insue:

                                Dromio keepe the gate: Husband Ile dine aboue with you to day, And shriue you of a thousand idle prankes: Sirra, if any aske you for your Master,

                            creature enter: Come sister,

                            go.

                    Enter Antipholus of
                            Ephesus, his man Dromio, Angelo the Goldsmith, and Balthaser the
                        Merchant.

                    
                    
                        E. Anti.
                        Good signior Angelo you must excuse vs all, My wife is shrewish when
                            I keepe not howres; Say that I lingerd
                            with you at your shop To see the making
                            of her Carkanet, And that to morrow you
                            will bring it home. But here’s a villaine
                            that would face me downe He met me on the Mart, and that I beat him, And charg’d him with a thousand markes in gold, And that I did denie my wife and house;
                                Thou drunkard thou, what didst thou
                            meane by this?

                        Say what you wil sir, but I know what I know, That you beat me at the Mart I haue your
                            hand to show; If ye skin were parchment, &amp; ye
                            blows you gaue were ink, Your owne
                            hand-writing would tell you what I thinke.

                        I thinke thou art an asse.

                        Marry so it doth appeare By the wrongs I suffer, and the blowes I beare, I should kicke being kickt, and being at that passe, You would keepe from my heeles, and
                            beware of an asse.

                        E. Dro.
                        You would say so Master, if your garments were thin. Your cake here is warme within: you stand here in
                            the cold. It would make a man mad as a Bucke to be
                            so bought and
                            sold.

                        A man may breake a word with your sir, and words are but winde: I and breake it in your face, so he break it not
                            behinde.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        It seemes thou want’st breaking, out vpon thee hinde.

                        Haue patience sir, oh let it not be so, Heerein you warre against your reputation, And draw within the compasse of suspect Th’vnuiolated honor of your wife. Once this your long
                            experience of your wisedome, Her sober
                            vertue, yeares, and modestie, Plead on
                            your part some cause to you vnknowne; And
                            doubt not sir, but she will well excuse Why at this time the dores are made against you. Be rul’d by me, depart in patience, And let vs to the Tyger all to dinner,
                                And about euening come your selfe
                            alone, To know the reason of this strange
                            restraint: If by strong hand you offer to
                            breake in Now in the
                            stirring passage of the day, A vulgar
                            comment will be made of it; And that
                            supposed by the common rowt Against your
                            yet vngalled estimation, That may with
                            foule intrusion enter in, And dwell vpon your graue when you are dead; For slander liues vpon succession; For euer hows’d, where it gets possession.
                    

                    
                    
                        Anti.
                        You haue preuail’d, I will depart in quiet, And in despight of mirth meane to be merrie: I know a wench of excellent discourse, Prettie and wittie; wilde, and yet too
                            gentle; There will we dine: this woman
                            that I meane My wife (but I protest
                            without desert) Hath oftentimes vpbraided
                            me withall: To her will
                            we to dinner, get you home And fetch the
                            chaine, by this I know ’tis made, Bring
                            it I pray you to the Porpentine, For there’s the house: That chaine will I bestow (Be it for nothing but to spight my wife)
                                Vpon mine hostesse
                            there, good sir make haste: Since mine
                            owne doores refuse to entertaine me, Ile
                            knocke else-where, to see if they’ll disdaine me.

                        Do so, this iest shall cost me some expence.
                    

                    
                    Exeunt.

                



                

                    
                    Enter Iuliana, with
                            Antipholus of Siracusia.

                    
                    
                        Iulia.
                        And may it be that you haue quite forgot A
                            husbands office? shall Antipholus
                            Euen in the spring of Loue, thy
                            Loue-springs rot? Shall
                            loue in buildings grow so ruinate? If you
                            did wed my sister for her wealth, Then
                            for her wealths-sake vse her with more kindnesse: Or if you like else-where doe it by stealth, Muffle your false loue with some shew of
                            blindnesse: Let not my
                            sister read it in your eye: Be not thy
                            tongue thy owne shames Orator: Looke
                            sweet, speake faire, become disloyaltie: Apparell vice like vertues harbenger: Beare a faire presence, though your heart be tainted, Teach sinne the carriage
                            of a holy Saint, Be secret false: what
                            need she be acquainted? What simple
                            thiefe brags of his owne attaine? ’Tis
                            double wrong to truant with your bed, And
                            let her read it in thy lookes at boord: Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed, Ill deeds is doubled with an euill word:
                                Alas poore women, make vs not beleeue
                                (Being compact of credit) that you
                            loue vs, (H4b)
                            Though others haue the arme, shew vs the
                            sleeue: We in your
                            motion turne, and you may moue vs. Then
                            gentle brother get you in againe; Comfort
                            my sister, cheere her, call her wise; ’Tis holy sport to be a little vaine, When the sweet breath of flatterie conquers strife.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Anti.
                        Sweete Mistris, what your name is else I know not; Nor by
                            what wonder you do hit of mine: Lesse in
                            your knowledge, and your grace you show not, Then our earths wonder, more then earth diuine. Teach me deere creature
                            how to thinke and speake: Lay open to my
                            earthie grosse conceit: Smothred in
                            errors, feeble, shallow, weake, The
                            foulded meaning of your words deceit: Against my soules pure truth, why labour you, To make it wander in an vnknowne field?
                                Are you a god? would you create me
                            new? Transforme me then, and to your
                            powre Ile yeeld. But if that I am I, then
                            well I know, Your weeping sister is no
                            wife of mine, Nor to her
                            bed no homage doe I owe: Farre more,
                            farre more, to you doe I decline: Oh
                            traine me not sweet Mermaide with thy note, To drowne me in thy sister floud of teares: Sing Siren for thy selfe, and I will
                            dote: Spread ore the
                            siluer waues thy golden haires; And as a
                            bud Ile take thee, and there lie: And in
                            that glorious supposition thinke, He
                            gaines by death, that hath such meanes to die: Let Loue, being light, be drowned if she sinke.

                        Swart like my shoo, but her face nothing like so cleane kept: for why? she sweats a man may goe o­

                        What I should thinke of this, I cannot tell: But this I thinke, there’s no man is so vaine, That would refuse so
                            faire an offer’d Chaine. I see a man

                        A man is well holpe vp that trusts to you, I promised your presence, and the Chaine, But neither Chaine nor Goldsmith came to me: Belike you thought our loue would last

                            and therefore came not.

                        Ah Luciana, did he tempt thee so? Might’st thou perceiue austeerely in his

                            or no: Look’d he or red or pale, or sad
                            or merrily? What obseruation mad’st thou
                            in this case? Oh, his hearts Meteors
                            tilting in his face.

                        He meant he did me none: the more my spight.

                        Then swore he that he was a stranger heere.

                        That loue I begg’d for you, he begg’d of me.

                        With words, that in an honest suit might moue. First, he did praise my beautie, then my
                            speech.

                        I cannot, nor I will not hold me still, My tongue, though not my heart, shall haue his will. He is deformed,
                            crooked, old, and sere, Ill-fac’d, worse

                        Who would be iealous then of such a one? No euill lost is wail’d, when it is gone.

                        Ah but I thinke him better then I say: And yet would herein others eies were worse: Farre from her nest the Lapwing cries away; My heart praies for him, though my
                            tongue doe curse.

                        No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse then hell: A diuell in an euerlasting garment hath him; On whose hard heart is button’d vp with steele: A Feind, a Fairie, pittilesse and ruffe:

                        Time is a verie bankerout, and owes more then he’s worth to season. Nay,
                            he’s a theefe too: haue you not heard men say, That time comes stealing on by night and
                            day? If I be in debt and theft, and a
                            Serieant in the way, Hath he not reason

                        No? why ’tis a plaine case: he that went like a Base-Viole in a case of leather; the man sir, that when
                                gentlemen are tired giues them a
                            sob, and rests them: he sir, that takes
                            pittie on decaied men, and giues them suites of durance: he that sets vp his rest to doe
                            more ex­ ploits with his Mace, then
                            a Moris Pike.

                        S. Dro.
                        I sir, the Serieant of the Band: he that brings any man to answer it that breakes his Band: one that thinkes a man alwaies
                            going to bed, and saies, God giue you
                            good rest.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Well sir, there rest in your foolerie: Is
                            there any ships puts forth to night? may we be gone?
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Why sir, I brought you word an houre since, that the Barke Expedition
                            put forth to night, and then were you
                            hindred by the Serieant to tarry for the Hoy Delay: Here are the angels that you sent for to
                            deliuer you.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        The fellow is distract, and so am I, And here we wander in illusions: Some blessed power deliuer vs from
                            hence.

                        Cur.
                        Well met, well met, Master Antipholus: I see sir you haue found the Gold-smith now: Is that the chaine you
                            promis’d me to day.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Sathan auoide, I charge thee tempt me not.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Master, is this Mistris Sathan?
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        It is the diuell.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Nay, she is worse, she is the diuels dam: And here she comes in the habit of a light wench,
                            and thereof comes, that the wenches say
                            God dam me, That’s as much to say, God
                            make me a light wench: It is writ­ ten, they appeare to men like angels of light, light is an effect of fire, and fire will burne:
                                ergo, light wenches will burne, come not neere
                            her.
                    

                    
                    
                        Cur.

                        S. Dro.
                        Master, if do expect spoon-meate, or bespeake a long spoone.

                        Why Dromio?
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Marrie he must haue a long spoone that must eate with the diuell.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ant.
                        Auoid then fiend, what tel’st thou me of supping? Thou art, as you are all a sorceresse: I coniure thee to leaue
                            me, and be gon.
                    

                    
                    
                        Cur.
                        Giue me the ring of mine you had at dinner, Or for my Diamond the Chaine you promis’d, And Ile be gone sir, and not trouble
                            you.

                            a rush, a haire, a drop
                            of blood, a pin, a nut, a cherrie- stone: but she more couetous, wold haue a chaine: Ma­ ster be wise, and if you giue it her,
                            the diuell will shake her Chaine, and
                            fright vs with it.

                        I pray you sir my Ring, or else the Chaine, I hope you do not meane to cheate me
                            so?

                        Auant thou witch: Come Dromio let vs go.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Dro.
                        Flie pride saies the Pea-cocke, Mistris that you know.
                    
                    Exit.

                    
                    
                        Cur.
                        Now out of doubt Antipholus is mad, Else would he neuer so demeane himselfe,
                                A Ring he hath of mine worth fortie
                            Duckets, And for the same he promis’d me
                            a Chaine, Both one and other he denies
                            me now: The reason that I gather he is
                            mad, Besides this
                            present instance of his rage, Is a mad
                            tale he told to day at dinner, Of his
                            owne doores being shut against his entrance. Belike his wife acquainted with his fits, On purpose shut the doores against his
                            way: My way is now to
                            hie home to his house, And tell his
                            wife, that being Lunaticke, He rush’d
                            into my house, and tooke perforce My
                            Ring away. This course I fittest choose, For fortie Duckets is too much to loose.

                            trust the Messenger, That I should be
                            attach’d in Ephesus, I tell
                            you ’twill sound harshly in her eares. Enter Dromio
                                    Eph. with a ropes end.

                            the monie. How now sir?

                        E. Dro.
                        I would I were senselesse sir, that I might not feele your blowes.

                        Thou art sensible in nothing but blowes, and so is an Asse.

                        I am an Asse indeede, you may prooue it by my long eares. I haue serued him from the houre of my Natiuitie to this instant, and haue
                            nothing at his hands for my seruice but
                            blowes. When I am cold, he heates me
                            with beating: when I am warme, he cooles me with beating: I am wak’d with it when I
                            sleepe, rais’d with it when I sit,
                            driuen out of doores with it when I goe from home, welcom’d home with it when I returne, nay (H6b)
                            I beare it on my shoulders, as a begger
                            woont her brat: and I thinke when he
                            hath lam’d me, I shall begge with it from doore to doore.

                        When as your husband all in rage to day Came to my house, and tooke away my Ring, The Ring I saw vpon his finger now, Straight after did I meete him with a
                            Chaine.

                        I am sorry Sir that I haue hindred you, But I protest he had the Chaine of me, Though most dishonestly he doth denie
                            it.

                            credit infinite, highly belou’d, Second to none that liues heere in the Citie: His word might beare my wealth at any

                        ’Tis so: and that selfe chaine about his necke, Which he forswore most monstrously to

                            speake to him: Signior
                                Antipholus, I wonder much That you would put me to this shame and trouble, And not without some scandall to your
                            selfe, With
                            circumstance and oaths, so to denie This
                            Chaine, which now you weare so openly. Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment, You haue done wrong to this my honest friend, Who but for staying on our Controuersie,
                                Had hoisted saile,
                            and put to sea to day: This Chaine you
                            had of me, can you deny it?

                        I thinke I had, I neuer did deny it.

                        Yes that you did sir, and forswore it too.

                        I, but not enough.

                        It was the copie of our Conference. In
                            bed he slept not for my vrging it, At
                            boord he fed not for my vrging it: Alone, it was the subiect of my Theame: In company I often glanced it: Still did I tell him, it was vilde and
                            bad.
                    

                    
                    
                        Ab.
                        And thereof came it, that the man was mad. The venome clamors of a iealous woman, Poisons more deadly then a mad dogges tooth. It seemes his sleepes were hindred by thy
                            railing, And thereof comes it that his
                            head is light. Thou saist his meate was
                            sawc’d with thy vpbraidings, Vnquiet

                            raging fire of feauer bred, And what’s a Feauer, but a fit of madnesse? Thou sayest his sports were hindred by

                        She neuer reprehended him but mildely, When he demean’d himselfe, rough, rude, and wildly, Why beare you these rebukes, and answer
                            not?

                            in assaying it.

                            parcell of mine oath, A charitable dutie
                            of my order, Therefore depart, and leaue

                        She is a vertuous and a reuerend Lady, It
                            cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

                        May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husbãd, Who I made Lord of me, and all I had,
                                At your important
                            Letters this ill day, A most outragious
                            fit of madnesse tooke him: That
                            desp’rately he hurried through the streete, With him his bondman, all as mad as he, Doing displeasure to the Citizens, By rushing in their
                            houses: bearing thence Rings, Iewels,
                            any thing his rage did like. Once did I
                            get him bound, and sent him home, Whil’st to take order for the wrongs I went, That heere and there his furie had committed, Anon I wot not, by what
                            strong escape He broke from those that
                            had the guard of him, And with his mad
                            attendant and himselfe, Each one with
                            irefull passion, with drawne swords Met
                            vs againe, and madly bent on vs Chac’d vs away: till raising of more aide We came againe to binde them: then they
                            fled Into this Abbey, whether we pursu’d
                            them, And heere the Abbesse shuts the
                            gates on vs, And will not suffer vs to
                            fetch him out, Nor send
                            him forth, that we may beare him hence. (I1va)
                            Therefore most gracious Duke with thy
                            command, Let him be brought forth, and
                            borne hence for helpe.

                        Long since thy husband seru’d me in my wars And I to thee ingag’d a Princes word, When thou didst make
                            him Master of thy bed, To do him all the
                            grace and good I could. Go some of you,
                            knocke at the Abbey gate, And bid the
                            Lady Abbesse come to me: I will
                            determine this before I stirre.

                        Oh Mistris, Mistris, shift and saue your selfe, My Master and his man are both broke loose, Beaten the Maids a-row, and bound the
                            Doctor, Whose beard they haue sindg’d
                            off with brands of fire, And euer as it blaz’d, they threw on him Great pailes of puddled myre to quench the haire; My Mr
                            preaches patience to him, and the while His man with Cizers nickes him like a foole: And sure (vnlesse you send some present helpe) Betweene them they will
                            kill the Coniurer.

                            take you, To scorch your face, and to
                            disfigure you: Cry within.
                            Harke, harke, I heare him Mistris: flie,
                            be gone.

                        E. Ant.
                        My Liege, I am aduised what I say, Neither disturbed with the effect of Wine, Nor headie-rash prouoak’d with raging ire, Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser
                            mad. (I1vb)
                            This woman lock’d me
                            out this day from dinner; That Goldsmith
                            there, were he not pack’d with her, Could witnesse it: for he was with me then, Who parted with me to go fetch a Chaine, Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
                                Where
                                Balthasar and I did dine together. Our dinner done, and he not comming
                            thither, I went to seeke him. In the
                            street I met him, And in his companie
                            that Gentleman. There did this periur’d
                            Goldsmith sweare me downe, That I this day of him receiu’d the Chaine, Which God he knowes, I saw not. For the
                            which, He did arrest me with an Officer.
                                I did obey, and sent my Pesant home
                                For certaine Duckets: he with none
                            return’d. Then fairely
                            I bespoke the Officer To go in person
                            with me to my house. By’th’way, we met
                            my wife, her sister, and a rabble more Of vilde Confederates: Along with them They brought one Pinch, a hungry leane-fac’d Villaine;
                                A meere Anatomie, a
                            Mountebanke, A thred-bare Iugler, and a
                            Fortune-teller, A
                            needy-hollow-ey’d-sharpe-looking-wretch; A liuing dead man. This pernicious slaue, Forsooth tooke on him as a Coniurer: And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my
                            pulse, And with no-face (as ’twere)
                            out-facing me, Cries out, I was possest.
                            Then altogether They fell vpon me, bound
                            me, bore me thence, And in a darke and
                            dankish vault at home There left me and my man, both bound together, Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, I gain’d my freedome; and immediately
                                Ran hether to your Grace, whom I
                            beseech To giue me ample satisfaction
                                For these deepe
                            shames, and great indignities.
                    

                    
                    
                        Gold.
                        My Lord, in truth, thus far I witnes with him: That he din’d not at home, but was lock’d out.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duke.
                        But had he such a Chaine of thee, or no?
                    

                    
                    
                        Gold.
                        He had my Lord, and when he ran in heere, These people saw the Chaine about his necke.
                    

                    
                    
                        Mar.
                        Besides, I will be sworne these eares of mine, Heard you confesse you had the Chaine of him, After you first forswore it on the Mart,
                                And thereupon I drew my sword on
                            you: And then you fled
                            into this Abbey heere, From whence I
                            thinke you are come by Miracle.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Ant.
                        I neuer came within these Abbey wals, Nor
                            euer didst thou draw thy sword on me: I
                            neuer saw the Chaine, so helpe me heauen: And this is false you burthen me withall.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duke.
                        Why what an intricate impeach is this? I
                            thinke you all haue drunke of Circes cup: If heere you hous’d him, heere he would
                            haue bin. If he were mad, he would not
                            pleade so coldly: You
                            say he din’d at home, the Goldsmith heere Denies that saying. Sirra, what say you?
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        Sir he din’de with her there, at the Porpen­ tine.
                    

                    
                    
                        Cur.
                        He did, and from my finger snacht that Ring.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Anti.
                        Tis true (my Liege) this Ring I had of her.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duke.
                        Saw’st thou him enter at the Abbey heere?
                    

                    
                    
                        Curt.
                        As sure (my Liege) as I do see your Grace.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duke.
                        Why this is straunge: Go call the Abbesse hi­ ther. I
                            thinke you are all mated, or starke mad.
                    

                    (I2a)
                    
                    Exit one to the Abbesse.

                    
                    
                        Fa.
                        Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word: Haply I see a friend will saue my life, And pay the sum that may deliuer me.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duke.
                        Speake freely Siracusian what thou wilt.
                    

                    
                    
                        Fath.
                        Is not your name sir call’d Antipholus? And is not that your bondman
                                Dromio?
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        Within this houre I was his bondman sir, But he I thanke him gnaw’d in two my cords, Now am I Dromio, and his
                            man, vnbound.

                        I am sure you both of you remember me.

                        Our selues we do remember sir by you: For
                            lately we were bound as you are now. You
                            are not Pinches patient, are you sir?
                    

                    
                    
                        Father.
                        Why looke you strange on me? you know me
                            well.

                        Oh! griefe hath chang’d me since you saw me last, And carefull houres with times deformed hand, Haue written strange
                            defeatures in my face: But tell me yet,
                            dost thou not know my voice?

                        Dromio, nor thou?

                        No trust me sir, nor I.

                        I am sure thou dost?
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dromio.
                        I sir, but I am sure I do not, and whatso­ euer a man denies, you are now bound to beleeue him.

                            all the Conduits of my blood froze vp: Yet hath my night of life some memorie: My wasting lampes some fading glimmer
                            left; My dull deafe eares a little vse
                            to heare: All these old witnesses, I

                        Oh my olde Master, who hath bound him heere?

                        Who euer bound him, I will lose his bonds, And gaine a husband by his libertie: Speake olde Egeon, if thou bee’st the man That hadst a wife once call’d
                                Æmilia, That bore thee
                            at a burthen two faire sonnes? Oh if thou bee’st the same Egeon,
                            speake: And speake vnto the same
                                Æmilia.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duke.
                        Why heere begins his Morning storie right: These two Antipholus, these two so like, And these two Dromio’s, one
                            in semblance: Besides
                            her vrging of her wracke at sea, These
                            are the parents to these children, Which
                            accidentally are met together.
                    

                    
                    
                        Fa.
                        If I dreame not, thou art Æmilia, If thou art she, tell me, where is that sonne That floated with thee
                            on the fatall rafte.

                        By men of Epidamium, he, and I, And the twin Dromio, all were taken vp; But by and by, rude Fishermen of
                                Corinth
                            By force tooke Dromio, and
                            my sonne from them, And
                            me they left with those of Epidamium. What then became of them, I cannot tell: I, to this fortune that you see mee
                            in.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duke.
                        Antipholus thou cam’st from Corinth first.

                        No sir, not I, I came from Siracuse.
                    

                    
                    
                        Duke.
                        Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Ant.
                        I came from Corinth my most gracious Lord.

                        E. Ant.
                        Brought to this Town by that most famous Warriour, Duke
                                Menaphon, your most renowned Vnckle.
                    

                    
                    
                        Adr.
                        Which of you two did dine with me to day?
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Ant.
                        I, gentle Mistris.
                    

                    
                    
                        Adr.
                        And are not you my husband?
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Ant.
                        No, I say nay to that.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Ant.
                        And so do I, yet did she call me so: And
                            this faire Gentlewoman her sister heere Did call me brother. What I told you then, I hope I shall haue leisure to make good, If this be not a dreame I see and
                            heare.
                    

                    
                    
                        Goldsmith.
                        That is the Chaine sir, which you had of mee.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Ant.
                        I thinke it be sir, I denie it not.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Ant.
                        And you sir for this Chaine arrested me.
                    

                    
                    
                        Gold.
                        I thinke I did sir, I deny it not.

                                Dromio, but I thinke he brought it not.
                    

                    
                    
                        E. Dro.
                        No, none by me.
                    

                    
                    
                        S. Ant.
                        This purse of Duckets I receiu’d from you, And Dromio my man did bring them me: I see we still did
                            meete each others man, And I was tane
                            for him, and he for me, And thereupon
                            these errors are arose.

                        It shall not neede, thy father hath his life.

        Commentary Notes


        1
            Dramatis Personæ] After Rowe (ed. 1709); F has no list.
                    Barton
                (1990, pp. 67–70) contrasts Plautus’s careful use of names with Sh.’s nearly
                systematic failure to make anything of them: To turn from the Menaechmi to The Comedy of Errors
                    is to exchange onomastic neatness and lucidity for opacity, and also a measure
                    of contradiction. . . . The names he chose throughout, a mixture of Greek,
                    Latin, English, Semitic, and Italian, all of them functioning as praenomen, are,
                    on the whole, uncommunicative. . . . Attempts to establish the literary or
                    other origins of the names . . . tend to be . . . unhelpful, not because
                    antecedents cannot be found, but because there are too many of them, and—given
                    the arbitrary way names are attached to particular individuals—little
                    possibility of determining the original context. . . . In the Menaechmi, names had not only been expressive, but an integral part
                    of the selfhood of their bearers. . . . Shakespeare’s interest in what might be
                    called the psychology of names—how people use and feel about their own and those
                    of other people—was to become something that not even Ben Jonson in the period
                    could rival. In this particular early comedy, however, for whatever reason, it
                    is a concern striking only by its absence.
        


        2
            Salinus] Spelled this way rowe1-john2. Named only once
                    (Solinus), at 5. Gray (1927, p. 108): The only Solinus whose name could have
                    been known to him was Solinus Grammaticus, who wrote a geographical compendium
                    based on Pliny’s Natural History and called Pontica. He
                suspects that Sh. did not read the Latin, but instead depended on Arthur Golding’s
                translation (1587). Baldwin (1947, pp. 680–1) thinks that Sh. wanted to
                    honor the geographer because he spoke well of Ephesus, the
                setting of the play changed from Plautus’s Epidamnus. Ibid. (p. 776 n.): A character
                    Solinus . . . is found in Lyly’s Campaspe as an
                    Athenian citizen with some half a dozen lines to speak; but Shakspere was
                    probably thinking of the geographer.
        


        3
            Ægeon] Spelled Egeon in F. Gray (1927, p. 108): From
                Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.10–11, Proteaque ambiguum, balaenarumque prementem Aegaeona suis
                    immania terga lacertis, in Golding’s tr., Unstable Proteus . . . ; Aegeon leaning boysterously on
                    backes of mighty Whales. Gray notes that Proteus also figures in another
                early play, TGV. Baldwin (1947, pp. 685–6) quotes Cooper’s
                (1565) account of Aegeus, father of Theseus, who drowned himself after Theseus,
                having killed the Minotaur, returned home by sea, forgetting that his black sail
                meant his death; the sea was thereafter called Aegeum: Here was a name with
                    sufficiently tragic connections to be bestowed upon this unhappy parent.
                Baldwin does not, nor does anyone else, notice that at the top of Cooper’s page
                (fol. Aiiiv of the Dictionarium
                    Historicum) is the entry on Aegæon, a son of Titan and Terra who threw
                rocks at his father and was bound with an hundred chaynes to the rockes of
                    the sea Aegæum. He was in deede a notable and cruell
                    Pirate of great power, and therefore called Centum geminus because he had an hundred menne seruyng him in his
                    shyppes, language that calls up chains and twins (geminus). Foakes (ed. 1962, p. xxx): Egeon, who
                    suffered the loss of his wife and one son when the mast they floated on struck a
                        mighty rock ([104]), seems to be derived from the name of the sea, which Solinus
                    accounts for in this way: On the ryght hand, as men sayle to Antandros, there is a
                        Rock . . . which . . . seemeth to ha[u]e the shape of a Goate, which the
                        Greekes call Æga. . . . Of this Rocke the [Ægæan] Gulfe taketh [hys] name.
        


        4, 5
            Antipholis] Spelled this way F2-john2, v1773-rann; Antiphilis cap. Antipholus, the usual spelling in F1, has
                caused trouble because it is etymologically wrong. It ought to be Antiphilos or
                Antiphilus, a name for a lover derived from Greek ἀντιφιλἰα, mutual affection (Lloyd in Singer, ed.
                1856, 4:81). The problem is compounded because the name is spelled Antipholis the first three times it appears (162, 273,
                and 394) by Compositors C and D, but
                after—in order of printing—each spelled it Antipholus (617, 786, and thereafter). Eds. since Malone (ed.
                1790) have settled on Antipholus because Capell (1774, sig. U4v) emended ruinate (790) to ruinous:
                    Which suggested the true and right name, at least as far as the
                    -us ending is concerned. Baldwin (1947, p. 696)
                sensibly believes that Sh. wanted a significant name, i.e., one that
                characterized its bearer: So the name Antiphilus was doubtless calculated to
                    give the impression of a nice young lover, as each of the brothers is supposed
                    to be; his archness betrays him—see Altman below. Baldwin thinks
                that Antipho- results from Sh.’s finding the name in
                Terence’s Phormio: When from memory he [Sh.]
                    attempted to turn it [Antiphila, a female in Terence’s Self-Tormenter] into the masculine, Antipho got in the way to
                    produce first the intended-to-be-Greek form Antipholis, which then became the
                    equally intended-to-be Latin form Antipholus. If this process indeed
                produced the garbled name, it argues against Sh.’s being a schoolmaster before he
                came to London at the beginning of his career, for schoolmasters should not make
                such mistakes. Baldwin is followed by Riehle (1990, pp. 177–8). Bullough
                (1957, 1:9): In Sidney’s Arcadia Lib. 2 Antiphilus,
                    beloved by Erona and rescued by her from prison, falls in love with someone
                    else. When King he justifies polygamy and is slain by women. Perhaps Shakespeare
                    was thinking ironically of this when he had to name his henpecked and
                    not-very-faithful or affectionate Citizen. But Sh. had to name the
                Syracusan brother as well; the irony would have been at best half appropriate.
                Sidney’s Antiphilus is, as well, low-bred and something of a coward who only
                unwillingly joins Pyrocles and Musidorus in personal combat, getting himself
                captured. E. Antipholus was a brave warrior (1666–70). Altman (1978, p. 166 n.): Willichius
                    etymologizes the name Antipho, which is the apparent source
                    of . . . Antipholus, as follows: [Αντἰφων] reluctans &amp; renitens,
                            semper contrarius, ab [ἀντὶ]
                        &amp; [φἀων] (Terence
                    &lt;1567&gt;, cited by Baldwin, p. 696). Baldwin does not believe this is the
                    source of the name, arguing that it derives from Antiphila, one who returns love, but this does not
                    characterize the behavior of the brothers, which is reluctans and renitens, at least that of E. Antipholus. Garton (1979,
                p. 237) proposes that Sh. knew of a centaur named Pholus in Metamorphoses 12.306, which he combined with another centaur,
                Antimachus (12.406): The anti- served a double
                    purpose. First, it meant that each twin was counterpart to a
                        Pholus, that is, counterpart to a centaur and having
                    symbolical affinities with one; second, it meant that each twin is reciprocal to a centaur, i.e., reciprocal to
                    the other twin. His proposal is met with approval by Truax (1992,
                p. 35) and Brown (1998, p. 180), who proposes a pun on Pholus-phallus to make
                up for Sh.’s not using Plautus’ bawdy Peniculus.
            Baldwin
                (1947, p. 695) finds that 16th-c. editors had derived Plautus’s Menechmus from Greek
                    ἀιχμἠ (spear point), so Menechmus meant
                    bellator, warrior. Baldwin very obliquely hints that this gloss
                influences the presentation of E. Antipholus as a former soldier (1666–70): and this warrior
                    idea is evidently the significance which attaches to the
                    corresponding character in The Comedy. It is an
                attractive possibility nowhere else remarked on.
            Unlikely interpretations include Wordsworth (1864, p. 96 n.): [Perhaps] the
                    name . . . is a mistake (on the part of author or printer) for Amphibolus . . . i.e. ambiguous,
                        doubtful.
                Feldman
                (1955, p. 117): Antifollies, since, he says, Err. is the product of Sh.’s recognition that his marriage was a
                disaster. Asimov (1970, 1:173–4): From the Greek words meaning
                        opposed in balance. They [= the twins?] are so alike that if
                    each were placed on the opposite side of a balance, the balance would remain
                    unmoved.
            Foakes (ed.
                1962, p. 2), sensibly: We do not know where Shakespeare found [the
                    name].
        


        4
            Sereptus] (273), along with
                    Erotes (162)
                and Errotis (394), appears to be Sh.’s attempt to distinguish the two same-named brothers,
                probably influenced by Plautus’s Argumentum: A Sicilian merchant, who had
                    twin sons, died after one of them had been stolen [surreptus]. To the boy who
                    was left at home his paternal grandfather gave the name of the stolen
                    [surrepticii], calling him Menaechmus instead of Sosicles. . . . Here it was
                    that his stolen [surrepticus] brother had been brought up (tr. Nixon,
                1917, 2:365). Steevens (ed. 1778): The translator, W. W[arner] calls the brothers, Menæchmus Sosicles, and Menæchmus the traveller. Whencesoever Shakespeare adopted erraticus and surreptus (which either he or his editors have mis-spelt)
                    these distinctions were soon dropt.
                Capell (1774,
                p. 71) thinks Sereptus indicates that Sh. read Plautus’s
                Latin, but he does not explain just what Sh. looked at to get the name. Glover (in
                    Clark &amp;
                        Wright, ed. 1863, 1:462): Plainly
                    derived from Plautus’ Menæchmus Surreptus, a well-known
                    character in Shakespeare’s day: see Brian Melbancke’s Philotimus (158[3], p. 160): Thou art like Menechmus
                        Subreptus his wife.
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928, p. 108) adds Robert Greene, Carde of Fancie, pr.
                1584: Thou art Castania . . . like Menechmus Subreptus his wife.
        


        5
            Erotes] The significance of this word has proved difficult to account for,
                spelled thus at 162 and Errotis at 394 by
                Compositor C, setting (by formes) first Errotis, then Erotes. Steevens (ed. 1778): Meaning,
                        perhaps,—erraticus. . . . 
                    One of these twins wandered in search of his
                    brother. Others suppose that the identifier somehow is influenced by
                Plautus’s Erotium, the courtesan. Hertzberg (ed. 1870, 8:192) proposes that
                someone (not Sh.) lightly acquainted with Latin noticed that Erotium enters to the
                visiting Menaechmus in 1.3, who is not identified by his identifier
                    (Beiname) in the stage direction (he is already on stage), and
                that the person made a strained etymological connection with errare
                to produce Errotis and Erotes. Anders (1904, p. 33): Erotes
                    looks like a compromise between Erotium . . . and
                        Sosicles, the surname of the other Menæchmus.
                Baldwin
                (1947, p. 697) thinks it likely that Erotium lies behind the identifier
                    (Shakspere could have intended his Erotes to mean the
                        lover . . . the Antiphilus who fell in love, silently
                abandoning his theory of ed. 1928, p. 105: Shakespeare is merely following up
                    his error idea . . . and intends his title to mean the mistaken
                    one. The word Errotis, I take it, is
                        Erratus, the u being changed for i, just as Antipholus frequently [sic: three times] is
                    spelled Antipholis. The o was also
                    substituted for a, either through misreading or
                    similarity of sound. Cooper [1565] defines Erratus as
                        That hath [ben] wand[r]ed or strayed in . . . . The word
                    would thus mean to Shakespeare the mistaken one, and would be
                    peculiarly appropriate to Antipholus of Syracuse.

                7
            Dromio] Cuningham (ed. 1907, p. xxxvi) finds the name in Lyly’s Mother Bombie
                as that of a servant to Memphi[o]. A character Dromo, Greek
                    runner, figures in three of Terence’s plays.
        


        8
            Balthazar] Levith (1978, p. 69): Perhaps named to suggest one of
                    the wealthy wise kings of the Nativity story (cf. 1896). Barton (1990, p. 68): Protect the
                        king. The name appears in Ado (a
                singer), MV (Portia’s servant), and Rom. (Romeo’s man). Spelled Balthaser (618, SD), Balthasar (1700, dialogue),
                twice Balthazar (638, 641, dialogue).
        


        9
            Angelo] Levith (1978, p. 69): The . . . tag name is obvious,
                    as an angel was a gold coin with Saint Michael stamped on
                    it. Venice’s reputation for great wealth, as in MV and Volpone, may account for the Italian
                name of the goldsmith.
        


        11
            Second Merchant] Dyce (ed. 1857) first distinguishes the First
                Merchant of 1.2 who is S. Antipholus’s friend, and the Second Merchant of 4.1,
                    to whom Angelo is a debtor. But Capell (ed. 1768), without
                comment, lists two other Merchants in his
                Dramatis Personae.
        


        
            12
            Dr. Pinch] Gaw (Sincklo, 1926) shows that the minor actor John Sincklo (Sincler), whose
                name appears in several SDs and SPs in other plays, played roles remarkable for the
                physical features described at 1714–18, especially the extreme thinness; the
                Officer in 2H4 5.4.33 (3201)
                who comes to arrest Doll is called an Anatomy (skeleton) as is Pinch
                at 1715. Gaw does not, however, identify
                Pinch with Sincklo. Armstrong (1946, p. 44) associates pinch (in a chapter titled Pinch’s Partners) with
                a cluster of images that relate to what he calls the master image of
                Life and Death: His [Sh.’s] thought constantly played between them, and other
                    images ordered themselves in accordance with their relationship to these two
                    supreme image categories.
                Riehle
                (1990, p. 182): If an exorcist wants to expell evil spirits from the human
                    being in whom they dwell, he has to pinch them in return, and
                    therefore Dr Pinch’s name suggests part of his activity as an exorcist;
                he quotes 587. Gurr (1996, p. 280) doubts
                that any parts were written for Sincler before the establishment of the
                Chamberlain’s men in 1594, but (privately) grants that the uncertain dating of
                    Err. makes it possible that Sh. had Sincler in mind. On
                the validity of his doctorate, Poynter (1964, p. 154): England had many
                    quacks and mountebanks whose sole aim was money. . . . Shakespeare has [little]
                    to say about this gallimaufrey . . . but his Pinch . . . is clearly one of
                    them. The more prosperous and respectable of these quacks would be accorded the
                    title Doctor, for the borderline between qualified and
                    unqualified practice was never very clear and their pretensions were accepted
                    without much question. Adriana calls him Good
                    (1330).
        


        13
            Æmilia] Her name is regularly changed to Emilia by
                nonclassicizing commentators and editors to match Egeon. Since the
                theater audience does not know that she is Egeon’s wife, it is perhaps unfortunate
                to identify her as such for a reading audience. Levith (1978, p. 69):
                    Aemilia is flattering or winning one from the Latin. Her
                    name alliterates with her husband’s, and is especially noticeable when she
                    reveals herself to him at 1827–31.
        


        14
            Adriana] The name is the Italian feminine usually described as based on
                Hadrianus, a man of Hadria, a city in northern Italy. In this form it is very rare.
                    Feldman
                (1955, p. 119): We could translate her name as the dark
                    one, from Latin atra, black. Riehle (1990, p. 179): Since it recalls the
                    male name Hadrian, it implies a certain maleness, and therefore
                        Adriana seems just the right name for the shrewish
                    wife. But he prefers to derive it from Adriane, a variant
                of Ariadne found in Ovid, Chaucer, and Gower; his argument is strained. The Adriatic Sea is likely to have played a role in her
                naming.
        


        15
            Luciana] Again, the form is the Italian feminine. Sh. seems to have gone
                to some pains to find these contrasting names. The name of Apollonius’s wife (in
                Laurence Twine’s version of Apollonius of Tyre,
                The Patterne of Painefull Adventures, 1594) is Lucina, the
                Roman goddess of childbirth. She is unnamed in Gower’s version in Confessio Amantis, Book 8, called there only some version of the
                    king’s daughter or wife. Some commentators erroneously
                say that Lucina is named in Gower. Feldman (1955, p. 119): The bright
                    one, from Latin lux, light. Riehle (1990,
                p. 183): It is simply inconceivable that this name was not meant as a
                    deliberate allusion to Lucian, who was esteemed by Renaissance humanists as one
                    of their favourite authors of late antiquity. He writes a chapter
                entitled Erasmus, Thomas More, and the Lucianic Tradition
                to buttress his proposal. Again, it seems more likely that Sh. wanted the dark-light
                contrast than Riehle’s exceedingly complicated proposal. Many commentators remark on
                the similar pairings of dark, small, feisty with tall, blond, simpering characters
                in the early comedies and propose that Sh. had two such boys in his company. What
                company that might have been depends on when he wrote Err.
        


        16
            Luce] Also, apparently, called Nell (900) and jocularly, Dowsabell (1099). The renaming has not been convincingly explained. Sh. elsewhere
                names two characters the same or nearly so, e.g., the two Jaques in AYL, but no one knows why. She is called Kitchin
                    wench (886) and Kitchen maide (1360), but some commentators call her cook without
                authority. Foakes (ed. 1962, p. xxv): The courtesan’s maid and cook
                    [in Menaechmi] are transferred to the wife, and changed
                    into Luce, . . . and Nell, and in n., These are assimilated into
                    one figure towards the end of the play . . . but the two names . . . may
                    reveal Shakespeare’s first thought of taking over into his play both the maid
                    and a figure corresponding to the cook, Cylindrus. Bland (ed. Gesta Grayorum, 1968, pp. 94–5) thinks Luce may refer to Luce
                Morgan, a notorious brothel keeper mentioned in Gesta
                    Grayorum: I would like to suggest that Nell, who is called
                        swart at [893],
                    was temporarily renamed Luce for the occasion of the play’s performance at
                    Gray’s Inn because Lucy Negro Morgan is mentioned as one of the
                    Prince’s [i.e., of Purpoole, the mock prince of the Gray’s Inn revels]
                    followers, and that the name remained in the script. The exchange between Luce
                    and the party at the door is bawdy enough to warrant the change of the name at
                    this point. Commentators divide on whether she is E. Dromio’s wife or
                his intended. The first group, e.g., Gaw (Sincklo, 1926,
                p. 627); Gill (1930, pp. 45, 51); Muir (1957 and
                1977, p. 16); Levin (ed. 1965, p. xxxii); Bonazza (1966, p. 36); Leary (1977,
                p. 46), takes S. Dromio’s horrified account of her attentions, 861 ff., as a parody of Adriana’s marriage. The other
                group, e.g., Grennan (1980, p. 154); Hibbard (1981, p. 93); Bevington (ed. 1973, p. 81, and ed. 1992, p. 3), takes it as a
                parody of S. Antipholus’s wooing of Luciana, 815 ff. Some commentators do not specify. Soellner (1972, p. 71): S.
                Dromio is claimed as a husband by a woman he does not know; Barton (in
                    Evans,
                ed. 1974, p. 81): Not to mention the dubious bond between the Ephesian Dromio
                    and his spherical Nell. Some have it both ways, e.g., Foakes (ed.
                1962, p. xxxiii): Nell . . . who is affianced to his twin and at
                line 945, Dromio and Antipholus
                    each fleeing from a wife; and Nevo (1980, p. 33). The
                groups seem not to notice each other. See 679, 873, 945, 1908.
                    Nell, diminutive of Helen and Ellen, appears in six of
                Sh.’s plays, where Sh. uses Nell consistently to
                    describe a woman of questionable reputation (Champion, 1968, p. 358).
        


        17
            Curtizan] So spelled at 1227;
                    Courtizan (995, 1321, and 1426); Courtezan
                    (1497). First listed in ed. 1778.
                She is based on Plautus’s Erotium.
        


        18
            Headsman] A silent part; see 1600. He accompanies the chained Egeon onstage at 1600, probably carrying an axe.

            The . . . Errors] Steevens (ed. 1773), quoting the argument of Menaechmi, Father, wife, neighbours, each mistaking
                    either, Much pleasant error, ere they meete togither (tr. Warner, 1595;
                see ): Perhaps . . . these
                    lines suggested to Shakspeare the title for his piece.
                Baldwin (ed.
                    1928, p. 120, n. 3; 1947, pp.
                    691–2) believes that Sh. was influenced by Dionysius Lambinus’s edition of
                Plautus (1576), which marks each succeeding mistaken identity in the margin with
                some version of Latin error (n.) or errare (vb.), e.g., Hic sunt erroris initia (Here the errors begin): Naturally then,
                    this comedy of Menæchmi was to Shakespeare, or to any
                    one else using the edition of Lambinus, The Comedy of
                        Errors.
                Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821, 3:387) locates in the Revels accounts for performances in the Christmas
                season of 1576–7 The Historie of Error, showen at Hampton Court on New yeres
                    daie at night; enacted by the children of Powles. This play has not
                survived, but the entry convinced many that it was Sh.’s source. The phrase soon
                became somewhat common: Halliwell (ed. 1854) collects several examples between 1602
                and 1616; those in Munro (1932, 1:66, 107, 141, 181, 262, 282) all precede
                publication of F (1623). MacLean (1972, p. 30): The primary
                    meaning of error in Shakespeare’s time . . . was the
                        action of roaming or wandering (O.E.D.); to
                    recognize this is to notice Shakespeare’s insistent employment in the opening
                    and concluding scenes of the play (but also intermittently throughout the
                    action) of terms and images associated with travel, particularly nautical and
                    marine imagery. . . .  It seems . . . that [such] images . . . trace a
                    movement from restless and unfulfilled search, shipwreck, and a doubtfull
                        warrant of immediate death ([71]) to the harmonious concord of the final scene. See 194, 825, 1225.
                Sh. plays on the meaning in Hamlet
                    1.1.154 (153), th’extrauagant, and erring Spirit. The sense
                of wandering may seem too obvious, for it is seldom remarked on.

            Actus primus, Scena prima] Each act is marked this
                way, but the scenes are not marked after the first one, and Act 2 lacks the scene
                formula. Critics disagree about who was responsible for the designations, whether
                Sh. (Baldwin, 1947) or the printer (Greg, 1955, p. 201; Foakes, ed.
                1962, p. xvi).

            Ephesus] Warburton (ed. 1747) on 263–8: This was the
                    character the ancients gave [Ephesus].
                Upton (1746;
                1748, pp. 323–4 n.): Sh. calls Ephesus the land of conjurors and witches. He
                    had his eye chiefly on that passage in Acts xix,
                    19, explaining the bad reputation for chicanery Ephesus
                proverbially had. Capell (1774, p. 71) on 262–8: The character given of Ephesians in
                    this place is the very same that it had with the ancients, which may pass for
                    some note of the Poet’s learning.
                Douce (1807,
                2:289): In the ancient city of Ephesus we have ducats, marks, and guilders, and the abbess of a
                        nunnery. Mention is also made of several modern
                    European kingdoms, and of America; of Henry the Fourth of France, of Turkish
                    tapestry, a rapier, and a striking
                        clock; of Lapland sorcerers, Satan, and even of Adam and Noah. In one place Antipholis calls himself a Christian. As we are unacquainted with the immediate source whence
                    this play was derived, it is impossible to ascertain whether Shakspeare is
                    responsible for these anachronisms.
                Knight (ed.
                1842, pp. 135–6), against Douce: The poets of Shakspere’s time had no
                    hesitation in placing the fables of the romantic ages in classical localities,
                    leaving the periods and the names perfectly undefined and unappreciable.
                Lloyd (in
                    Singer,
                ed. 1856, 2:82) considers why Sh. changed the locale from Epidamnus to Ephesus,
                commenting on 264–8: The description is in accordance with various classical
                    notices of Ephesian practice, but inasmuch as it is still more so with the
                    account in the Acts of the Apostles of the exorcists in that city, Jewish and
                    other, we . . . see at least the poet’s motive for transferring [Err.] to a locality where such would most alarm and
                    bewilder, and professors of exorcism like . . . Pinch, be within call
                    traditionally; the play upon the name of Epidamnum, was necessarily lost in
                    translation (i.e., The verie name shews the nature, no man comes
                    hither sine damno [without
                    harm] [Menaechmi, tr. 1595; see ]). Porter &amp;
                        Clarke (ed. 1903): One of the twelve
                    Ionian cities, on the south bank of the Castrus, said to be named from one of
                    the Amazons; celebrated as the seat of worship of Artemis [Diana], and also for
                    the founding there by Paul of a Christian church. There has been some
                    discussion . . . as to whether in Shakespeare’s play we have pagan Ephesus or
                    Christian Ephesus. As the play is full of allusions which belong to Elizabethan
                    England, the wisest conclusion is to regard it as an Ephesus which existed only
                    in the poet’s fancy. Modern commentators beginning with Bullough
                (1957, 1: 9–10) emphasize the thematic advantages of referring to the Epistle to the
                Ephesians, with its call for obedience of wives to husbands, and servants to
                masters, as well as other matters pertinent to this play. Foakes (ed. 1962, pp. xxix f.):
                    One motive in changing the scene to Ephesus may have been to give the
                    play a setting more familiar to a London audience, for Ephesus was known not
                    only through the Bible, but as a seaport, and the home of a famous temple of
                    Diana. So, in The Excellent and pleasant Works of Julius
                        Solinus Polyhistor (1587 [Arthur Golding’s trans. of a 3rd-c. AD
                    book]), Shakespeare might have read of Asia Minor that it was enclosed on
                        the [W]est wyth the Aeg[æ]an Sea. . . .  In it is
                        the most famous Cittie Ephesus. The beauty of Ephesus
                        is the Temple of Diana, buylded by the Am[o]zons. There is no evidence that
                    Shakespeare did read this book, but he probably knew of Solinus, whose name he
                    gave to the Duke.
                Gray (1927,
                p. 108) first calls attention to Golding’s translation and the Duke’s name. Cantrell
                (privately) points out that the River Cayster, which had provided the harbor for
                Ephesus, had been silted in since at least AD 1500; Foss (1979, p. 168):
                    The record of sixteenth-century Ephesus is almost blank, and when
                    information is again available, the flourishing commercial town had declined to
                    become a village which constantly fell further into ruin and squalor. . . . 
                    The remaining harbor was silted and trade shifted to Izmir and
                    Scalanova. . . .  The swamps produced by the silting were no longer drained and
                    gave rise to malaria. Bullough, like Foakes, calls it a seaport, but
                neither Solinus nor Cooper (1565) mentions Ephesus’s much earlier fame as a port
                and mercantile city. Commentators, beginning with Wislicenus (1879, p. 94),
                sometimes remark that Gower’s queen is cast ashore at Ephesus in Apollonius of Tyre. It cannot be made certain whether Acts, Eph., or
                Gower first suggested the change in locale.

            Siracusa] Porter &amp; Clarke (ed. 1903): Syracuse was the most powerful and
                    important of all the Greek cities in Sicily, and was situated on the east coast
                    of the island. It is mentioned in Menaechmi,
                Prologue 17: Mercator quidam fuit
                    Syracusis senex (There was a
                    certain old merchant in Syracuse [tr. Nixon, 1917, 2:367]). Wells (ed.
                1972): F uses spellings ending in e [1599, 1849], a [7, 1801, 1806, 1809, 1811], and ia [401, 786, 861, 1183, 1440] indiscriminately except that scansion
                    sometimes demands a strong ending, as [7].
                Sy- spellings occur just twice (40, 165);
                see n. 18. Wells: The first
                    syllable is long, as in sire.

            Proceed . . . Ephesus] Gill (1930, p. 26), listing
                parallels with Menaechmi: Prologue and Argument: The father is mentioned;
                    he dies of grief when his son is lost.
        


        5
            Proceed] Schmidt (1875, 5): Go to work, act.
                OED does not attest this sense of starting up, but rather
                of continuing; hence Dorsch (ed. 1988) implies that the action begins
                        in media re (v. 3a). Matthews (1913, p. 71): In his search for his
                    lost sons the merchant has come to Ephesus in defiance of the decree which
                    forbade any Syracusan to land upon its shores under penalty of death. It
                is usually assumed Egeon was ignorant of the law, as apparently is S. Antipholus
                    (163–9).

            Solinus] Cuningham (ed. 1907): The Duke’s name
                    is not mentioned elsewhere in the play.

                1972): Rhymes with minus.

        7–31
            Merchant . . . Sonne] Smith (1966, pp. 23–4): The romance frame is
                    not entirely without traces of satire. . . .  If the duke’s pompous exposition
                    of the law . . . is not sufficient warning not to take too seriously the threat
                    which surrounds the central comedy, what follows it makes the signposting
                    unmistakable. Can Aegeon’s reply [30–1] be taken otherwise than as indicating that
                    the Duke’s platitudes are among the woes?
        


        7
            plead no more] Wells (ed. 1972, pp. 23–4): Egeon seems to have been
                    embracing his fate rather than pleading against it; but perhaps his end woes and all is interpreted as a plea for
                    sympathy.
        


        8
            partiall to] Schmidt (1875): Inclined to favour one party more than
                    the other (OED, a. 1b). Baldwin MS: By his
                    office an impartial upholder of the laws, Solinus cannot infringe them for
                    Egeon.
        


        9–29
            The . . . die] A trade war between two Greek city-states, not found in
                Sh.’s sources. Steevens (ed. 1778, 3:491) compares Shr. 4.2.81–2 (1937–8): ’Tis death for
                    anyone in Mantua To come to Padua. W. M. T. (1871, p. 220): George
                Gascoigne’s Supposes (1566), a source for Shr., uses a similar trade war between Siena and Ferrara. See Bullough
                (1957, 1:122). Unwin (1916, 1:315) describes contemporary English trade
                feuds: The Stratford council employed men armed with cudgels to keep out
                    traders of Coventry. . . .  Between many neighbouring towns there raged an
                    animosity almost as fierce as the feud between Ephesus and Syracuse.
        


        9
            late] How long the decree had been in effect is not clear. Egeon has been
                away from home for five years (135).
                    Matthews
                (1913, p. 71), apparently alone, thinks he has come in defiance of the
                    decree; see n. 5.

            your] Byrne (1936, p. 5): Solinus . . . uses [formal] your in referring to the Duke of Syracuse, and [it] may
                    well be regarded as plural in meaning, e.g. the Duke of you (all) of Syracuse. Addressing Aegeon directly, Solinus says thy [16] as
                    Duke to a person of the rank of subject, who is also a captive. Aegeon replies
                    with a respectful your [30]. She goes through the play commenting
                on the appropriate distinction between the singular and plural second-person
                pronouns.

                Dyce (ed.
                1857) notes the uniformity of the -ian spelling in
                    F as in all probability, that which Shakespeare chose to
                    adopt. Since both Compositor C (18, 21, 22, 32) and
                Compositor B (1592, 1765, 1807)
                spell it so, printer’s copy probably did too, though Compositor D sets Syracusian (165),
                and Compositor C sets Syracusa (40), probably their spellings. Baldwin MS notes the -ian spelling preferred by Ovid, emphasizing Ovid’s
                    basic place . . . in the school system. His examples are from
                    Fasti 6.277 and Epistolae ex

                    time scheme is adopted from Menaechmi. He sets
                forth this chronology: scene 1 takes place early in the morning (though there is no
                certain statement of how early); scene 2 later in the morning, an hour before dinner
                    (173); an hour apparently passes to
                past noon (210); Adriana thinks it must
                be two o’clock (277), though S.
                Antipholus objects that he has not been in Ephesus two hours (543); after a late dinner, S. Antipholus receives the
                chain that is to be paid for at suppertime (968), set for five o’clock (991); at 1051 a half hour has
                passed since S. Antipholus got the chain; Act 5 takes place at five o’clock (1587). Wells (ed. 1972): The
                    exact meaning of this couplet is not clear. Perhaps it means Yet this is

                MS: Since Compositor C invariably prefers other spellings in

                    from copy. Perhaps so spelled for the visual rhyme with done?

                    before the Court . . . practically serves the purpose of a classical
                    Prologue.
                Baker (1907,
                p. 140): It is a device for badly needed exposition which gets rid of a
                    chorus and also does away with the necessarily less dramatic recounting of the
                    story by Menechmus Sosicles in the original.
                Benham
                (1921, p. 377): Sh. perhaps got a hint of the pathos of Ægeon’s
                    situation from Menaechmi, Prologue 34–6:
                    As for the father, after he lost his son he was broken-hearted and died
                    of grief at Tarentum a few days later (tr. Nixon, 1917, 2:369). Gill (1930,
                p. 26): [Menaechmi] Prologue,
                    24–43. The father, accompanied by his son, takes merchandise to Tarentum; his
                    son is taken to Epidamnus. Commentators vary in their sympathy for the
                length of this exposition. Gentleman (ed. 1774): Few
                    authors . . . could have told Egeon’s long story in so
                    easy a flow of natural expression . . . ; notwithstanding one hundred and three
                    lines of narration are assigned . . . even decently recited, they must
                    please.
                Draper
                (1961, p. 28): The whole is an arid stretch of merely rhetorical monologue
                    occasionally broken by a comment of the Duke. . . .  Those who arrived in time
                    heard a tedious brief introduction; and those who were late would not understand
                    the fundamental fact of two sets of twins and so would lose the point of the
                    comedy.
                Berry (1965,
                pp. 41–2): [His] narration is utterly flat and colorless . . . because of
                    the near absence of variation and tone, because of the absence of vivid
                    realization . . . and because of the near absence of variation of tense and
                    grammatical construction. Yet the speech economically covers a
                complicated history. Shakespeare’s expository skill here is as striking as is
                    his poetic and dramatic dullness. He points out that Egeon tells his
                story without mentioning a single personal name.
                Barton (in
                    Evans,
                ed. 1974, p. 80): The speech is faintly absurd. A family of six scattered by
                    Fortune in a fashion at once so implausible and so ingeniously patterned
                    announces itself fairly clearly as material for a comedy resolution. Yet it is
                    wrong for actors to make Egeon’s explanation to the Duke overtly comic. The
                    anguish of the old man is real, even if the verse he speaks suggests delicately
                    to a theatre audience that his loss will not prove irremediable.
                Bergeron
                (1980, p. 113): The problem is not just length—some 158 lines—but that Egeon
                    speaks 107 of the lines. He does a 90-line stretch, interrupted only once by the
                    Duke, who perversely urges: do not break off so [99]—the Duke is no friend of
                    theatre!
                Evans (1960,
                pp. 2–5) and Scragg (1988, p. 63) emphasize how the exposition permits the
                theater audience to know what no one on stage knows, that there are two sets of
                identical twins. Sider (1973, p. 1) adds that Egeon’s uncertain fate
                    sustains curiosity when our interest might flag because the unravelling of a
                    plot based on mistaken identity is so singularly predictable.
                Huston
                (1981, pp. 20–1): Egeon is not an altogether reliable narrator. . . .  He
                    sometimes jumbles the particulars of these events, and his interpretation of
                    their meaning is often misleading.
                Schlüter
                (1958, pp. 109 ff.) accounts for what he takes as Egeon’s weak expository speech in
                grammatical terms: too many passive verbs; use of the pluperfect tense, which makes
                the account static; too much modifying of nouns; and the like. He calls this an epic
                style, not a dramatic one. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, p.
                239): Shakspere has combined as models the shipwreck of Aeneas off Sicily on
                    the African coast [Aeneid 1.34–157] and that of St.
                    Paul, which occurred also off Sicily in Adria (Acts 27:14–44).

                Baldwin

                his story from the beginning (a prima dic [1.753]) just
                as Solinus asks Egeon (32–4). Tilley (R89): The Revealing of grief is a renewing of

                Baldwin
                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 125) alone thinks that Egeon means
                that he is condemned by original sin—he deserved by nature all that he got
                    before he was saved by God’s wonderful mercy.

                (§480): Monosyllables ending in r or re, preceded by a long vowel or
                    diphthong, are frequently pronounced as dissyllables. . . .  Our (perhaps), citing this line. Cuningham (ed. 1907):
                    Shakespeare never makes the word a dissyllable, even in the early plays.
                    See [284].
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): A pause after me (me;
                        F) seems appropriate, and lines short by a syllable are not
                    uncommon, cf. [58]. . . .  The
                    verse of this scene is very regular, but its flow is broken to good effect here,
                    and occasionally elsewhere, as at l. [58] and l. [65].
                Tillyard
                (1965, p. 50): Most expressive in rhythm. It must be read: Ańd bý me, hád not
                    our háp been bád, with had bearing a lighter stress than
                    the other stressed words. Read thus, it suggests an afterthought following a
                    long pause and serves to set up that feeling of the speaker’s taking his time
                    which is essential if we are to prepare ourselves for a long
                narrative.
        


        43–64
            With . . . aboord] Gervinus (1863, 1:188–9): In this family lie
                    together the strange contrasts of domestic love and a roving spirit; these
                    produce alternate happiness and misfortune. . . .  His wife, expecting to
                    become a mother, hastened from Syracuse to join him. The inducement to this
                    journey, the poet has left as a matter of conjecture; . . . if a loving, it was
                    also a wilful step, and . . . it is evident in itself, that the step combined
                    at once those contrasting qualities of family affection and love of wandering.
                    Was it the result of suspicion and jealousy . . . ? We should think so. . . . 
                    She made, against the will of her husband

                Freedman
                    (Egeon’s Debt, 1980, p. 374; Errors, 1980, p. 240) appears to read 63–4 as meaning Egeon did not
                want to accompany Æmilia back to Syracuse as part of a pattern of desired marital
                separation for which he later expresses guilt. Cf. 1075, 1077,
                    1453, 1461.

            increast] Wells (ed. 1972): Probably the participle—being
                        increased . . . —rather than the active verb.
        


        44
            made] White (ed. 1857): A merchant was said to make a voyage
                    when he sent a ship on one. It is evident, from the context, that Ægeon did not go to Epidamnum until after the death of
                    his factor there. Not attested by OED, but
                seems right.
        


        45
            Epidamium] See textual note. Plautus, Menaechmi, followed by Warner in his translation of 1595, uses Epidamnum: Epidamnum devenit (Argumentum 6, and comes to Epidamnum), the accusative of Epidamnus, the true name of the city hardly ever used by
                commentators. Epidamium is the invariable spelling of
                    F: cf. 65, 163, 1074, 1083,
                    1841, 1845. Compositor C set the first three, Compositor B
                the remaining four. To preserve meter, pronounce Epidam-yum.
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928): Shakespeare was following contemporary editions of Plautus, which
                    emended the first occurrence of the word in the prologue (line 33) to Epidamnium
                    for the meter. Eds. who read Epidamnum assign the
                    error variously. Clark &amp; Wright (ed.
                1863): Probably a printer’s error.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): The mistake may well be Shakespeare’s.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): [Epidamnium] may be what Shakespeare wrote. A confusion of minim
                    letters is the commonest kind of compositorial error, and it is not likely that
                    Shakespeare left out n as F
                    does.
        


        45–7
            factors . . . spouse] Sebek (1998, pp. 176 f.) on how Err. participates in the ways a newly expanded commercial trade
                disrupted social relationships: Emilia’s movement results in the displaced
                    birth of the identical twins, their separation from each other, and the farce of
                    mistaken identity played out in Ephesus. Overseas trade, in short, confounds
                    identity.

            he] See textual note (he . . . left). Capell (1774, pp. 70–1): The
                    construction . . . is extremely singular: the whole line must be consider’d as
                    one individual substantive, by which drew
                    in the next line is govern’d; as if the wording had been,—and his leaving great store of

                            Adonis (940) and in the Sonnets (147.12)—both printed from Shakespeare’s
                    own papers,—as well as in I Henry
                            VI (V.3, 84 [2522]); only once in Shakespeare [TGV 2.1.111 (501)] do we

                    affectionate (OED, a. 6).
        


        48
            moneths] OED (Month):
                    In the 16–17th c. the spelling moneth was almost universal.
        


        49–50

                    whether . . . Ægeon refers to the faintness which attends the period of
                    quickening [the stage of pregnancy when the fetus stirs], or to the exhaustion
                    of parturition. If to the former, it is remarkable that the time mentioned,
                        not six months, is made to correspond with the proper time
                    for the physiological event.

            pleasing punishment] Carter (1905, p. 44): A reference to the

                Weber (1963,
                p. 36), collecting oxymorons in Err., points out that pregnant in the biological sense was taboo in Elizabethan
                English, hence this euphemism; OED bears her out.

            distinguish’d . . . names] Cf. 131. No convincing explanation of this mistake, namely that the twins are
                said to have different names, has been offered. Eds. notice that Plautus names his
                twins Menaechmus and Sosicles, and that in the Argumentum the boys’ grandfather
                    changed the name of this other twin, i.e., renamed Sosicles
                Menaechmus, thinking Menaechmus dead. Hypotheses include the Clarkes’ (ed. 1864): The
                    four boys had originally some distinguishing appellation: but afterwards, one of
                    each pair of twins, in remembrance of his lost brother, took his name. . . . 
                    That the two pair of twins . . . should be named alike was necessary for
                    the . . . dramatic equivoke.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): They are distinguished on their first appearance as
                        Erotes and Sereptus . . . (see . . . I.ii

            meane] Schmidt (1875, Mean adj. 2): Low, humble, poor
                    (OED, a.1 2b). Malone (ed. 1790): Poor . . . was inserted for the sake of metre.
                Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821): Some word was omitted by the compositor of the original copy; but
                        [poor] . . . can hardly be the authour’s word, for
                    in [60] we have— —for their
                        parents were exceeding poor. However, rather
                    than print an imperfect verse, I have admitted this clumsy emendation.
                White (ed.
                1857): That the use of the comparative [meaner]
                    implied no positive meanness of condition in Ægeon’s
                    wife, the whole literature of Shakespeare’s day . . . may be brought to
                    prove, citing Tmp.

                Eichhoff
                (1903, p. 69): Though the line is unmetrical with meane we
                have no right to emend, according to our theories of dramatic versification, what
                was earlier in general practice (i.e., the occasional writing of unmetrical lines)
                (Ger.). Foakes (ed. 1962): Meaner . . . is
                    an unnecessary regularization. The point is not that the woman is of lower rank
                    than Egeon’s wife, but that she is very base indeed, and exceeding
                        poor [60].
                Wells (ed.
                1972) offers no evidence for his suggestion that meane was
                pronounced as two syllables, and neither Kökeritz (1953) nor Cercignani (1981) hints at
                the possibility. Werstine MS: Sh. is using meane
                    in an absolute sense to distinguish the lowest class as he does in H5, meane and gentle all (1834) and in 1H6, meane and
                        right poore (2194).
        


        59
            burthen Male] See textual
                    note. Wells (ed. 1972): The phrase is not recorded, though
                        child male,
                    heir male, etc. are used in legal terminology. The
                emendation based on a transposed comma seems best.

            burthen] I.e., burden, child (children). The two spellings were
                interchangeable (OED, Burden sb.). Cf. 1745, 1829, 1892.

            wee came aboord] Collier (ed. 1842): Malone [by his punctuation] would
                    make the sense run on to the next line: the clear meaning is, that they
                        came aboard too soon, in consequence of the storm that almost
                    immediately followed.
                Maxwell
                (1953, p. 100): The notion of Virgilian imitation [of half lines] vindicates
                    the text. The whole speech is modelled on Aen[eid] II,
                    as T. W. Baldwin has pointed out [1944, 2:485–7], and it happens that book has
                    more unfinished lines than any other in the Aeneid.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): A pause for Egeon to recover from his emotion is entirely appropriate,
                    and common in Shakespeare; see Abbott, 511–12 on short lines, often
                expressing emotion.

                Grierson
                (1910, p. 58): It is curious to contrast the treatment of the theme [of a
                    family scattered by shipwreck and united] with that of the later plays. There is
                    not a trace of the mystic wonders and splendour of the storm that blew when
                    Marina was born, or [in Tmp.]. In the Comedy of Errors
                    the always wind obeying deep brings simply terror and

                    forebodes [to] the sailors instant death.
                Baldwin
                (1944, 2:486–7 and Genetics, 1965, pp. 244–6) elaborates the process by which
                Sh. transformed Vergil’s line into his own.
        


        71
            doubtfull] Either uncertain (Schmidt, 1874, 3 [OED, a. 1]) or,
                more likely, Onions (rev. 1986, 2): Causing dread; awful, to be
                    feared (OED, a. 3, despite the last citation of 1555–6). The word causes some
                trouble. Theobald (letter to Warburton, 27 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:292): It plainly appears by the context that they were certain of
                    immediate death: I rather think the Poet wrote, A dreadful warrant, &amp;c.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): Hardly, as Craig [Gen. Ed.] says, awful,
                    dreadful; but rather implying the great probability of the truth
                    of the statement, like the Latin phrases haud scio an [not at all, by no means] . . . etc.,
                comparing Lr. 5.1.12
                    (Q1 only, where the word means suspicious). Cunningham
                (1950, p. 39): The English equivalent for the Latin poetic epithet dubius, and means practically
                        emotionally upsetting. . . . Hence, the passage [66–71] means:
                    the general tenor of our voyage had been pleasant and hopeful until a fact
                    occurred that clearly implied the imminence of the contrary, of violent death or
                    tragedy; there succeeded the tragic atmosphere, fear and emotional upset in
                    anticipation of the tragic upshot.

                    Collier
                (1853, p. 77): There seems no reason why Ægeon should gladly have
                        embraced death, if he could have escaped it.
                Elliott
                (1939–40, p. 98): Aegeon’s sorrowfulness is immense. The dramatist hints,
                    unconvincingly, that it is not merely the fruit of circumstance: it is
                    constitutional. The old man tells us that he would gladly have
                        embraced death . . . on a certain occasion when he was still young,
                    rich, and blessed with a happy household! We don’t see why; but we see that this
                    stroke is intended to intensify his air of sadness. This much-cited
                essay marks the beginning of serious thematic interpretation of Err., but here Elliott seems to forget that the certain
                    occasion was imminent shipwreck and death. Knowles (privately):
                    The idea is a commonplace in Sh.: I could have borne it myself, but
                    concern for others etc. The gladly . . . imbrac’d is
                    simply hyperbole for I was ready to accept my fate.

            this] Collier (ed. 1858): This is made to
                    signify thus: this may be said to agree
                    with means understood (OED, adv. 1).
        


        78
            was . . . none] Eds. divide in understanding the punctuation of
                    F. From Rowe (ed. 1709) to Singer (ed. 1856), the line
                apparently is thought to sum up what preceded, and so ends in a period. The trouble
                is that there are no other meanes to summarize. But the
                summative function is obscured when other eds., beginning with Capell (ed.
                1768), end line 77 with a period as
                well, making line 78 an orphan, or a
                Janus, looking both ways. The remaining eds. follow F or dyce and see line 78 as an introduction to what follows. For example, Foakes (ed.
                1962): (This is what happened), for there were no other means than those we
                    took. . . .  The punctuation in F . . . may indicate that we
                    should understand thus it was: for (i.e. because . . . ) there were no
                        other means, the sailors sought, etc. . . .  The passage from l.
                        [77] on is a characteristically
                    Shakespearian sequence of thoughts linked emotionally, not logically, and other
                    arrangements of the sense are possible: I take it that Egeon’s this it
                        was introduces a general account of what happened, but he seems to
                    promise to describe the delays he sought, slides to what the
                    sailors did, and, instead of returning to himself, relates first what action his
                    wife took, and only then what he did himself. So another legitimate way of
                    taking the passage would be to regard the parenthesis in F as
                    closed too soon, and to extend it to include all the sailors did,
                        (for . . . to us).
        


        78
            other meanes] Either other than what I did
                Forst [as I was] to seeke, or
                    other than tying us to the mast.

            latter borne] See nn. 87,
                    127. Comments at one or the
                other place note that E. Antipholus is here the younger, but S. Antipholus is the
                younger at 127. Mason (1785, p. 45):
                    Shakespeare has here been guilty of a little carelessness. The
                    Clarkes
                (ed. 1864): It seems, though the mother, more careful for the
                        latter-born, had fastened him to the mast, yet that she had herself
                    become fastened to the other end where her elder twin son was secured; and thus,
                    being somewhat confusedly described (perhaps to give the effect of the confusion
                    of the wreck), some commentators have accused Shakespeare of oversight
                    here.
                Idem (1879,
                p. 18): And then the accident which divided the mast in twain, is so managed
                    by the dramatist as to allow of some latitude in construing the mode in which
                    the two sets of persons are saved; thus, when we afterwards find that it was the
                    elder son who escaped with the mother, and the younger son with the father,
                    there is no violation of consistency. Moreover, eldest here bears
                    the sense of most important,
                    first needing attention.
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928, p. 103): In the Menæchmi, it is father’s
                    son who goes to Tarentum and gets lost. Naturally, Shakespeare thinks of him as
                    the elder, though the distinction itself comes from Amphitruo, where the twins are born at one birth, although
                    Amphitruo’s son is a ten-month’s child, Jupiter’s seven. But in Shakespeare,
                    because of the changed device for the separation, it is mother’s boy who gets
                    lost, and father’s who stays at home. Hence to the time of the shipwreck, they
                    remain as in Plautus; but thereafter they get exchanged.
                Jorgensen
                (ed. 1964): [127] indicates,
                    puzzlingly, that not the latter-born, [i.e., the younger] but the
                    elder went with the mother.

                    sail—as a mast, when it was known as a jury-mast. See n. 106.

            Fixing . . . fixt] Parker (Elder and Younger,
                1983, pp. 325–6) uses the chiasmus to explain the elder-younger problem: [The
                    line] suggests a placing of the family members on the mast in such a way that a
                    kind of crossing takes place there, too—each parent, bound to one end of the
                    horizontal mast, gazing upon the twin most cared for, on the
                    opposite half of the mast. . . .  The child bound by the mother would be on the
                    father’s side of the mast and vice versa.
                Idem (1987,
                p. 23) repeats and further clarifies the positioning. Elam (1984, p. 256) finds
                chiasmus providing the main fun in CE,
                giving examples of 425–6, 446–8, 568–9. These dramatic-figural transactions . . . necessarily have
                    an immediate visual counterpart in the facial and costumic puns created amongst
                    the actors, and in the confusing succession of their entrances and
                    exits.

                commenting in 1746 on Hanmer’s emendation: It appears that the infants were
                    fastened at either end of ye same Mast, on ye middle of wch he &amp;
                    his wife rode, as it should seem, back to back, fixing their Eyes on whom their
                    care was fixed; that this Mast was broke in two by a rock, just between ye Husband and Wife, so that she was left with one
                    Child, and he with ye other.
                Porter &amp;
                        Clarke (ed. 1903), on Blackstone: Would
                    it not be a simpler and more harmonious family arrangement to imagine the
                    children nearer the middle of the mast and the mother and father at either end,
                    facing each other instead of back to back? Theirs is the arrangement
                usually accepted. For omission of the preposition, see Abbott §202.

                    which is the last-mentioned of the floating objects, instead of with my wife and I, which is logically the subject,
                citing Abbott §333 as in n. 14.
        


        89
            straight] Foakes (ed. 1962): Straightway, at once (OED, adv. 2a).
                    Baldwin
                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 152): It appears . . . that
                    Aegeon’s family was obliged to float straight [OED, adv. 1], obedient
                        to the streame . . . which fell into the Aegean of the
                    Mediterranean and was there still compulsive. Being compulsive [Oth. 3.3.453–6 (2103–6)], the
                    course would be straight and toward Corinth, as stated. No ed. since
                1965 has been persuaded by Baldwin’s argument that straight
                means straight southwest, based on a well-known feature of the Pontic sea:
                    Like to the Ponticke Sea, Whose Icie Current, and compulsiue course,
                    Neu’r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on To the Proponticke, and the
                    Hellespont (Oth. above). That is, the current
                of the Black Sea flows southwest into the Sea of Marmora and the Bosporus. The idiom
                    floating straight seems better glossed as Baldwin does
                than as floating immediately or floating at once. Of
                164 occurrences of straight in Sh.’s plays, however, only
                about 10 mean anything but immediately, and they are all adjectives.

            twice fiue leagues] Theobald (letter to Warburton, 27 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:292): I cannot tell how to be satisfied with this passage. Ægeon and
                    his wife were lashed to two several masts, expecting wreck; and, floating with
                    the stream, as soon as it was morning, they saw two vessels making amain to
                    them, and yet these vessels were no less than ten leagues from each other. This
                    seems a very wild story to me, that am but a fresh-water sailor.
                Baldwin
                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 241; see n. 65–72): If Greene and Lodge’s Looking
                    Glasse 1323 had stuck [in his mind], one may readily
                    suspect . . . that the ten leagues from sight of land then
                    betrayed Shakspere into the much-criticized [quotes 103] as the limits of sight at sea.

                the storm, quotes Acts 27:29, Then fearing lest we
                    should haue fallen on some rocke: The ship (mast) was
                        violently borne vp so that it could fall on
                    the rock biblical style and be splitted in the midst. . . . The
                    text of Errors is here certainly correct in reading

                Compositor C’s tendency to shorten forms in his copy. Huston (1981, p. 22), noting
                inconsistencies in Egeon’s tale: The storm that has threatened them all never
                    comes, and the sea at last waxes calm [94], but in this calm sea the ship is violently borne
                        upon a rock. There is less inconsistency than he alleges:
                the waves have calmed, but the mast is thrown on the rock by the force of the
                current.

                Brae (1851,

                    a goodly argosy split on the rocks, not a broken mast. A
                surprising number of commentators make the same mistake, e.g., Huston (1981, pp. 22 [see n.

                    is, in origin, a different word from wreck, but their meanings
                    overlap, and the former has passed out of common use (OED, Wrack sb.1). OED

                several works that might have influenced Err.: This
                    theme here takes the form of fate relentlessly pursuing hapless Aegeon into a

            Reft . . . name] Wilson (ed. 1922): Ægeon obviously intends to

                    construction is odd; [Wilson] . . . seems to be forcing the sense in order to
                    do away with the apparent contradiction [of 56]. Shakespeare is often inconsistent in minor
                    details; . . . here it becomes important to give the pairs of twins identical
                    names; this is a condition of the action to follow, which turns on
                        errors, but Shakespeare did not need to trouble about this in
                    describing their birth at [56].

                Baldwin
                    (Genetics, 1965, pp. 96–7) thinks that Reft is a clue to Sh.’s conscious manipulation of line 3 of
                the Latin Argumentum of Menaechmi, Nomen surreptitii indit illi qui domi est (To the boy who was left at home his
                    paternal grandfather gave the name of the stolen brother [tr. Nixon,
                1917, 2:365; Warner’s translation, ,
                gives a less literal sense]). Baldwin says Sh.’s Reft was
                    suggested by the alliterative-rept- as the proper
                    word to render surreptus [stolen]. . . .  This
                    philological and rhetorical relationship of Shakspere’s line to that of the argumentum makes it clear that Shakspere understood the
                        significance of the surreptus applied
                    to the one Menaechmus, as anyone who had passed through
                    the lower half of grammar school was supposed to know, or at least to be capable
                    of knowing.

                    quest of his youngest boy.

                    unmistakably the sole aspect of the tale that could render it fully plausible,
                    namely its weirdness or uncanniness. Certainly this note is present, but not
                    explicitly enough. In other words, the opening scene, from the standpoint of the
                    play’s whole mood [of weirdness], is not well tempered. Relatively too much
                    stress is placed on the pathos of the romance, and too little on its
                    weirdness. See n. 72.

            I . . . Ephesus] Upton (1746; 1748, pp.
                233–4): How could he spend five summers in Greece, roaming thro’ the bounds
                    of Asia? What a voyage too is here mentioned—roaming through the bounds of
                    Asia! . . . The passage is translated from the Menæchmi of Plautus [234–8,
                        six yeares now haue we roamde about thus, Istria, Hispania, Massylia, Ilyria, all the vpper sea, all
                        high Greece (Graeciamque exoticam), all Hauen Towns
                        in Italy (see )]. Who does not
                    see therefore that ASIA is the transcriber’s or press-corrector’s word instead
                    of ITALY?
                Halliwell (ed.
                1854): Upton proposes to read Italy, once known as Grecia Magna; but by bounds of Asia,
                    Shakespeare intended to imply the parts of farthest Greece that
                    were nearest to Asia.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): Ægeon probably means that he had been all through farther Greece,
                    and that he had travelled down the coast of the Ægean sea as far as
                    Ephesus.
                Baldwin
                (1947, pp. 675–6) quotes Acts 19:1 (Bishops’, 1573):
                    Paul passed through the vpper coastes, and came to Ephesus (see
                    ). Foakes (ed. 1962):
                    Shakespeare has altered the setting to Ephesus, and so substitutes Asia
                        (Ephesus—A noble auncient city in Asia the lesse, Thomas
                    Cooper, Thesaurus, 1578) for some of the names [in
                    Plautus]. Magna Greciae was an area in southern Italy. Mowat &amp;
                        Werstine (ed. 1996): The influence of
                    St. Paul’s journeys to, and long sojourn in, Ephesus is apparent in these lines.
                    In Acts 13–20, which describe Paul’s three journeys
                    through Greece and Asia, the word Asia is used much as we would Asia
                    Minor. . . .  That the Book of Acts uses the term Asia to mean the peninsula
                    that includes Ephesus is indicated by such statements as . . . This
                        [preaching] continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard
                        the word of the Lord (Acts 19:10)

            fates] See 122–3. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, pp. 121–2):
                    The fates (fatum) are
                    against Aegeon, so that his hap, chance, fortune, is hapless,
                    unlucky, hopeless . . . as . . . the Duke now officially states. . . .  But
                    this fate . . . is not merely classical fatality; it is Christianized fatum, God’s providence,
                    destiny; but see n. 38.
        


        145–7
            Now . . . disanull] See textual note 146–7. Theobald (letter to Warburton, 27 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:292): [Pope’s] pointing is certainly wrong in the last line [would, they] and the order of the verses too, perhaps, is
                    to be disputed. Will the verb disannul answer properly to
                    all these substantives? How might he be said to disannull his crown, in shewing
                    pity? What if we should regulate the lines thus, transposing 146–7. Capell (1774,
                p. 71): Nothing is commoner, in classicks, and all the best writers, than
                    this reference of one single verb to a plurality of substantives, where those
                    substantives have so near a relation one to the other as [here]. The
                Duke is certainly contrasting his public and private selves, as 158 makes clear; only Wells &amp; Taylor (ed. 1986) of modern eds. have been persuaded by
                Theobald’s sensible objection. Shirley (1979, p. 79): Rulers [in Sh.’s
                    comedies] sometimes show a sense of position that is lacking in their history
                    play counterparts. There is no doubt in Solinus’ mind that he must abide by the
                    laws he has sworn to uphold, despite his sympathy for the aged Egeon. . . . 
                    The scene is so early in [Err.] that, were it not for
                    the title and the highly romantic nature of the old man’s tale, we might expect
                    a tense story of a search for the necessary bail.
        


        146
            Crowne] OED (sb. 3): The sovereignty, authority, or dominion of which a
                    crown is the symbol.
                Teague
                (1991, pp. 61–2): In a play based on middle-class life, the first property
                    that looks like a rich item is actually a token of identification: the
                    Duke . . . wears a crown to identify him to the audience as the ruling
                    authority in the play. . . .  The crown is a token of the rank and also of his
                    honor. . . .  The crown . . . helps an audience understand Egeon’s
                    relationship to the state by personifying that state in the duke. The
                    identification shows that the ( . . . state) is not hostile, but
                    inflexible. . . .  The role of the duke, which Renaissance critics would find
                    theoretically unsuitable for a comedy, actually allows the play to suggest a
                    middle-class concern: the anxiety any citizen might feel with the state.
                Despite this apparent inflexibility at the outset, the state ultimately proves
                    just and merciful in refusing to accept the ransom and by freeing
                Egeon.

            Therefore Marchant, Ile] See textual note. Abbott (§453) is uncertain of the scansion: Therefóre, | mérchant, | I’ll
                        lím | it thée | this dáy, seems to begin with two trochees. . . . 
                    But therefore may have its accent, as marked, on the last
                    syllable. The old pronunciation merchánt is not probable. Or
                        there may be one foot.
                Porter &amp;
                        Clarke (ed. 1903): Neither of [Abbott’s
                    alternatives] sounds as well as to read the line naturally, beginning with two
                    trochees, however great the shock to the cut-and-dried laws of blank
                    verse.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): Capell’s reading, perhaps, does least violence to the rhythm of
                    the line. . . .  Nevertheless I think we must keep the Folio reading, whilst
                    accentuating merchant on the first syllable. There is no single
                    passage in Shakespeare in which he accentuates it on the second
                    syllable. . . .  Therefore should be accentuated on the second
                    syllable, comparing MND
                    3.2.78 (1101), where, however, the word means in exchange.
                See OED (adv. [sb.] I, 1a, 2). Foakes (ed. 1962): The
                    change of rhythm marks the climax of the Duke’s speech, the transition from
                    comment to decision. He appears to scan as in Abbott’s first

                    of this day to seek for aid by charitable assistance. No convincing
                solution to this repetition exists, but see O’Connor below. Capell (1774,
                p. 71): thy helpe is genuine, and bear[s] the mark of
                    [its] writer.
                Malone (ed.
                1790): The jingle [helpe . . . helpe] has much of
                    Shakspeare’s manner.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1793): To seek thy life, can hardly be the true
                    reading, for, in ancient language, it signifies a base endeavour to take life
                    away. Thus, Antonio says of Shylock,—He seeks my life [3.3.21 (1708)]. I believe, therefore, the word—help, was accidentally repeated by the compositor, and
                    that our author wrote,—To seek thy help by beneficial means.
                Collier (ed.
                1842): [Hope], That is, to seek what you hope by beneficial
                    help to acquire—money for your ransom.
                Dyce (1844,
                p. 26), Lettsom (1853, pp. 190–1), and Dyce (ed. 1857) refute Collier,
                approving Malone’s (ed. 1790) much of Shakspeare’s manner.
                Singer (ed.
                1856, fine): Evidently what the context requires. . . .  The
                    repetition . . . is a mere printer’s error, by the eye glancing on a wrong word
                    in the line. And the Duke had said Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the
                        sum [156], implying that
                    the fine had been before mentioned by him.
                White (ed.
                1857, 3:206) offers examples that Capell and Malone do not: MM, leave
                2.1.135–6 (586–7); H5, steal
                5.1.87 (2981); Jn., dead
                2.1.352 (666). Wilson (ed. 1922):
                        Health preserves the required jingle.
                Idem (ed.
                1962) substitutes: But beneficial hap = lucky
                        chance restores sense to the whole context, and the duplication of
                        help is clearly compositorial.
                O’Connor
                (1977, p. 66): Compositor C tries to carry too much text in his head and is
                    therefore susceptible to having a word or phrase influence other words. . . . 
                    We know that Compositor C’s substitutions were often synonyms that need not be
                    orthographically similar; thus, other emendations, like life (Rowe) . . . or hope (Collier), are
                    possible.

                    intentional.
                Elze (1889,
                p. 9) lists this line among those in which the pause stands for an unaccented
                syllable: Gaoler,/ x take/. . . . 
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Such phrases, standing outside the metrical pattern . . . are often,
                    by their abruptness or brevity, very effective; cf. [178] (Abbott, [§§] 511–12).

            Egean] This unique spelling is Compositor C’s, who
                spells Egeon at 143; he set Egean first in the order of
                typesetting the pages. Compositor B spells Egeon at 1822, 1827, 1830.

            liuelesse end] White (ed. 1857): [Liuelesse]
                    not by a typographical error or careless writing, or from unsettled orthography,
                    but because that was a form of the word in use when the line was
                    written.
                Kellner
                (1925, pp. 7–8) suggests, in an example of the procedures of his book—emendation
                based on misreadings of English secretary hand—, t:l and m:u
                misreadings = timeless.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): This [Kellner] is tempting, but the tautology of the present text
                    effectively enough suggests Egeon’s despair.
        


        162
            Enter . . . Dromio] Clark &amp; Wright (ed. 1863): That this scene is laid at the Mart
                    appears from Antipholus’s allusion to this place in II.2.5, 6 [399–400]. . . .  As this play is derived from a classical prototype,
                    Capell has supposed no change of scene [between the scenes], but lays the whole
                    action in a Publick Place; evidently with much inconvenience to
                    the Persons.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): The opening lines continue the mood of I.i, economically establish
                    that another merchant from Syracuse has arrived in Ephesus, and give him a
                    motive for concealing his identity. Shakespeare remembered this scene in Tw. N., III.iii, where the
                    newly landed Sebastian goes off to view the city while Antonio waits at an inn
                    for him. The whole scene is in verse, including Dromio’s speeches, maintaining a
                    flow into Act II; we are released gently into the comic world of Ephesus, where
                    we never lose touch with the tone of the first scene.

            Antipholis Erotes] See  and n. 273. Capell (1774, p. 71): Perhaps a corruption of Sosicles, the name in Plautus and in Warner’s translation.
                    Clark &amp;
                        Wright (ed. 1863): Most probably [an
                    error] for Errans, or Erraticus.
                Tannenbaum
                (1932, p. 118): Sh. must have learned enough Latin . . . to know that the
                        wandering Antipholus was Antipholus erratus
                    (or eratus). The compositor mistook the a
                    for an o and the u for an e, as has happened elsewhere too; when Shakespeare wrote
                    the word with the final s-flourish, the compositor again
                    set up is.
                Baldwin
                (1947, p. 697): Likely to have been suggested to Shakspere by the name of the
                        meretrix [harlot] in Menaechmi, which was Erotium. . . .  He doubtless intended it to
                    signify the Antiphilus who fell in love, as distinguished from the Antiphilus
                    who had been stolen.
                Idem
                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 104) changes his mind:
                    Shakspere has in fact combined the Erot- of
                    Erotium and the masculine ending -es of Sosicles. . . . 
                    This is essentially the solution suggested by Anders [1904, p. 33], who had been
                    anticipated by Hertzberg [ed. 1870, 8:188–94]. . . .  Shakspere could, however,
                    have started with Eros itself and still have arrived at the solution Erotis
                    (Errotis). . . .  Evidently Erotes was intended to signify love,
                    a lover, or a beloved one, as their common name Antipholus also signified
                        mutual lover, the two names being thus yoked together as
                        twin etymologies.
                Wells &amp; Taylor (1987, p. 267) call Baldwin’s a
                    (strained) defence: Eratus would be an easier emendation, if it could mean
                        wandering; but if Shakespeare intended that meaning, his
                    Latin must have been very small indeed. Most commentators
                now agree that Tannenbaum’s or Wells &amp; Taylor’s explanations best account for
                the word.

            a Marchant] Foakes (ed. 1962): In
                        F no distinction is made between this merchant, who knows
                    what is going on in Ephesus, and the other merchant, who appears in IV.i and
                    later [981 ff.], and seems to be a
                    stranger to the city. They are clearly different characters, but this one
                    vanishes before the other enters, and Shakespeare simply calls each a
                        Merchant. . . . The whole play is notable for the author’s casual
                    treatment of names and speech headings.

            Dromio] See . Baldwin (Genetics, 1965,
                pp. 218–21): There is no Dromo anywhere in Plautus. . . .  The name Dromo
                    is . . . from the Greek, and means simply a runner, or messenger. Terence uses
                    a Dromo in three of his six plays. . . .  While Shakspere may have known the
                    use in [Lucian’s] Timon, there is nothing about it to
                    suggest his Dromios. . . .  Erasmus . . . put him into the Colloquies as a wit-chopping clown. . . .  Dromo appears variously
                    in the Renaissance Latin plays as a runner or messenger, where he is merely some
                    necessary bit of machinery. . . .  Lyly was the first to call this type Dromio
                    instead of Dromo [Mother Bombie, 1589], and Shakspere
                    the first to develop him into a full-size clown—into two as a matter of
                    fact.

            Mer.] Wilson (ed. 1922): Nothing in the
                    dialogue to show that this merchant, who has just arrived by ship with S.
                    Antipholus, belonged to Ephesus.
                Tannenbaum
                (1932, pp. 118–19): But [Wilson] is clearly wrong: had he just arrived by
                    ship he could not have known that a Syracusian merchant, not being able
                        to buy out his life, Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. How the
                    Merchant came to have charge of Antipholus’s money (line [170]) is unexplained, which he takes to be
                    the clumsy workmanship of a novice. The plays are full of such
                inconsistencies. The merchant’s advice to adopt a disguise is overtaken by
                events.

                Foakes (ed.

        169
            wearie sunne] Foakes (ed. 1962): Something of a poetical cliché in
                    Shakespeare’s early works, deriving from the personification of the sun as
                    Phaethon; cf. Ven., 529,
                        Sonn. VII, 9.
                Neither example is about Phaeton, but rather about the end of the sun’s daily
                journey; perhaps a slip for Phoebus. Baldwin (1950, pp. 21–2) discusses the figure of
                Tired Titan.

                    ouerseene in giuing my purse and money to Messenio, whom
                    I can no where find, I feare he is fallen into some lewd companie (see
                    , ), also comparing 395–400. Chambers (1930, 1:261):
                    It is curious to notice how often money and
                        dinner make double endings in [Err.]—15 of 22 verse lines. Foakes (ed. 1962): The
                    money which is to be the source of much confusion is thus emphasized in stage
                    action; cf. [219–48] below, and especially [246].

                Schlösser
                (1977, p. 31), arguing that commerce dehumanizes people: It is frightening that the
                Syracusan, despite the talk about freedom and money [165–9], doesn’t give a thought
                about helping his countryman (Ger.). Altman (1978), p. 167: Antipholus’s
                    response . . . is odd. . . .  He shows no interest whatever in the fate of his
                    fellow citizen, even when handed the money to buy out his life.
                    It is an early sign of his instinctual insularity. Such criticism of S.
                Antipholus is rare.
        


        171
            Centaure] The Clarkes (1879, p. 483): Shakespeare has recorded the
                    custom that prevailed in his time of giving particular names to particular
                    houses, especially houses of entertainment and houses of commerce.
                Bond (ed.
                    Shr., 1904): Besides Pegasus (Shr. 4.4.5 [2185]), inn signs
                in Sh. are the Centaur and the Porpentine (Err. 777), the Elephant (TN 3.3.39 [1508]), the Bunch of
                    Grapes (MM 2.1.129
                    [580–1]), the Boar’s Head (1H4),
                    the Garter (Wiv.), and perhaps
                    the Sagittary (Oth. 1.1.158 [173]). Foakes (ed. 1962): Possibly a London
                    inn bore this sign, but I have not found a reference to one. See Sugden (1925)
                for further detail. Cf. 270, 396, 404, 411,
                    1451, 1902. Sometimes writers carelessly suppose the Centaur
                is a stage locale, bearing a sign. It is an offstage, seaside inn. Garton
                (1979), Truax (1992), Kolin (1997–8), and Brown (1998) make variously
                plausible claims that the centaur, half-man half-horse, represents thematic elements
                in the play. Kolin (p. 6): The name of this inn resonates with portent about
                    Ephesus’s reputation [for dark magic]. . . .  The history of the mythic beast
                    signals the transformations that Antipholus himself will experience in Ephesus.

                (1911): Opportunity of doing something (OED, sb.2 11, quoting this line). Wilson (ed. 1922) and others
                admit both meanings.
        


        182–4
            A . . . iests] Gill (1930, p. 27): [Menaechmi] II.ii.317–318. Cylindrus, Erotium’s cook, says that
                    Menaechmus I jokes with him often. Menaechmus I is the citizen,
                Menaechmus II is the traveler.
        


        182
            villaine] Cuningham (ed. 1907): In a playful sense, but also
                    implying the original meaning of slave,
                    bondsman (OED,
                        sb. 1c, citing this line as the first
                occurrence, marking the playful sense). Singer (ed. 1826), less likely:
                    The French sense (OED,
                    Villein 1b: vassal). Onions (1911): Used
                    without serious implication of bad qualities (cf. rascal,
                    wretch), esp. as a term of address . . . (hence) good-humouredly
                    or as a term of endearment. Cf. 262, 334, 342, 412,
                    557, 624, 673,
                    1091, 1294, 1305,

        183
            dull] Greenblatt et al. (ed. 1997): Gloomy (OED, a. 4,
                citing this line).
        


        183
            melancholly] OED (Melancholy sb. 1): The condition of having too much
                        black bile . . . ; (3) Sadness and depression
                    of spirits; a condition of gloom or dejection. There appears to be no
                notion of melancholia. Cf. 1547, 1589.
        


        184
            Lightens] Schmidt (1874): To cheer (OED, v.1 2, quoting this line). Foakes (ed. 1962): In allusion to the
                    blackness of melancholy (OED,
                        v.2 2).
        


        184
            humour] See n. 183. Foakes (ed.
                1962): Disposition [OED, sb. 4], but still perhaps used here with
                    reference to melancholy as one of the four humours.
        


        185
            What] Schmidt (1875, 1e): Superfluously introducing a
                    question.

            benefit] Schmidt (1874, subst. 3): Advantage, profit
                    (OED, sb.
                3d).
        


        189
            soone . . . clocke] See textual note. Theobald’s comma makes for a difficulty, as Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821) notes: The present hour is about eleven, for the dinner hour was
                    twelve; and five o’clock would not be soon, reckoning from eleven, or even from
                    twelve. But the Merchant, I conceive, means that he will meet his friend in the
                    evening, nearly at five o’clock; either a little before
                    or soon after that hour. I therefore placed no stop after
                    the word soon.
                Collier (ed.
                1842), comparing 968, and Hudson (ed.
                1880) take soon at to mean about, a sense not
                supported by OED. The idiom has proved difficult to define.
                    Craig
                (Gen. Ed., in Cuningham, ed. 1907): At five o’clock
                        sharp, perhaps supported by analogy with OED (adv. 4). Baldwin
                (ed. 1928): Cooper [s.v. vesper, not prima] defines
                        Prima vespera, Liu. In the beginning of the
                            euening. So the expression means early in the
                        evening at five o’clock. . . . The sunset ending comes from Menæchmi, but the specific time of five may have been set
                    because plays ended about that time, which, at the time of year that the play
                    was to be performed, was sunset.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): The first indication of the hour when the action will be
                    completed, comparing 153 and
                    991, and also 968.
        


        189
            a clocke] Schmidt (1874, A, a corruption of different particles and
                formative syllables, 3): Before substantives; frequently changed to o’ . . . by M[odern] Edd. (OED, prep.2 2). Cf. 277, 991.
        


        190
            Please you] I.e., If it pleases you (OED, v. 3, 3c).
        


        190
            vpon] Generally at,
                on; this instance is unusual, apparently unexampled. The line is not
                in Schmidt
                (1875). The rendezvous does not take place.
        


        191
            consort] Malone (ed. 1790) supports consort with,
                comparing Rom. 3.1.46 (1476).
                    Steevens
                (ed. 1793) supports F with LLL 2.1.177 (675), Rom. 3.1.130 (1566). Singer (ed. 1826): I.e.
                        accompany (OED, v. 1).
        


        191
            bed time] Boswell (ed. 1821) thinks the emphasis must be on time to keep meter. White (ed. 1857) reads as a spondee.
        


        192
            present] Kittredge &amp; Ribner (ed. 1966):
                    Immediate, urgent (OED,
                        a. 9a). Cf. 986, 1017,
                    1270, 1649, 1891.
        


        193
            loose] I.e., lose; Sh. prefers this spelling. Schmidt (1874, Lose 9):
                    To suffer to vanish from the mind. He paraphrases: I will
                    try to forget my business and my care (OED, v.1
                5d). Foakes (ed. 1962): Roam at random, but perhaps suggesting
                    also the sense lose my wits, cf. [204] and n. (OED, v.1 5e, 10a, 10c). Cf. 204, 386, 1279, 1566.

                Wells (ed.
                1972): Wish you all you wish yourself.
        


        197–204
            He . . . selfe] The most frequently noticed speech in the play. Tilley
                (D613): As lost as a Drop of water in the sea.
                Gill (1930,
                p. 27): [Menaechmi] II.i.242–246. Menaechmus II is
                    unhappy at not finding his brother.
                Brink (1895,
                pp. 73–4): In the presentation of the brother who seeks his brother and
                    mother, and who feels the danger of being himself lost in the strange, great
                    city, lonely and foresaken in the wide world, we seem to hear an echo of the
                    emotions Shakespeare himself must have experienced after his arrival in London:
                    a drop in the ocean, in danger of losing himself in its depths.
                Fripp (1938,
                1:407) compares Matt. 10:39 with its play on find and lose (Geneva saue and lose). Foakes (ed.
                1962): This image perhaps grew by association from Egeon’s account of his
                    shipwreck, and parallels his story of searching by sea . . . for his lost
                    sons. . . .  As H. F. Brooks [Gen. Ed.] points out, images of water or melting
                    connected with dissolution of reality or loss of identity recur in Shakespeare’s
                    work and seem to spring from deep feelings, comparing TGV 2.4.196–8 (855–7), 3.2.6–9 (1451–5); R2 4.1.260–2 (2182–4); Ham. 1.2.129–30 (313–14); Ant. 4.14.9–11 (2835–7). Kittredge (ed.
                1936, p. 134), showing that Sh. had the details of the Latin phraseology
                    constantly in mind, compares Menaechmi 233–41
                (the farthest Greece lines at 135–7 plus—his
                    translation—If you were hunting for a needle, I think you would have
                    found it long ago, if it were to be found at all. We are seeking a dead man
                    among the living; for if he were alive, we would have found him long
                    ago.
                Baldwin
                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 160) concurs without noticing
                Kittredge. Levin (ed. 1965, p. xxxvii): When Messenio saw the two
                    Menaechmuses together, he declared that water was not more like water. After
                    Shakespeare has adapted the metaphor, it stands not for an easy correspondence
                    but for an unending quest.
                Menaechmi 1089–90: neque aqua aquae nec lacte est lactis, crede mi, usquam
                    similius | quam hic tui est, tuque huius autem (No drop of water, no drop of milk, is more like another,
                    believe me, than he’s like you, yes, and you like him, sir [tr. Nixon,
                1917, 2:478]). Nixon’s drop may have been influenced by Sh. See
                    Miles Gloriosus 551–2: nam ex uno puteo similior numquam potis | aqua aquai sumi
                    quam haec est atque ista hospita (For, sir, you couldn’t draw two drops of water from the
                    same well more like each other than she’s like that guest of yours, sir
                [tr. Nixon, 1917, 3:181]). Warner (tr. 1595): I neuer sawe one man so like an
                    other; water to water, nor milke to milke, is not liker then he is to
                    you (see ).
        


        199
            to the world] Schmidt (1875, to prepos. 6): In comparison of,
                followed by Cuningham (ed. 1907). This seems wrong. Wells (ed.
                1972): In relation to the world (as the drop of water is in relation to the
                    ocean).
        


        200–1
            That . . . Who] Abbott (§260): That
                    [which] introduces an essential characteristic, and for the
                quasi-personifying Who, Ibid. (§264): The slightest active force, or
                    personal feeling, attributed to the antecedent, suffices to justify who. Cf. Franz §334. Poole (2001,
                p. 203): The language of watery dissolution is syntactically mimetic: who is
                    referred to by Who? Antipholus or the droplet? And whom does
                        Unseen, inquisitive [202] qualify? Pursuer or quarry? Antipholus and the water-drop become
                    syntactically intertwined and the linguistic confusion mirrors the real
                    confusion of Antipholus, given dramatic articulation in this scene as he
                    proceeds to address the wrong Dromio as [206].

            his fellow] Mowat &amp; Werstine (ed. 1996):
                    Its companion. The personifying seems more probable.
        


        202
            Vnseene, inquisitiue] Perring (1886, p. 72): Unseen
                    is a participial adjective used absolutely, and refers not to the drop that
                    seeks, but to the fellow drop that is sought; his fellow having been
                        unseen by him, or, to put it more colloquially, without
                        having seen his fellow in his inquisitiveness, he confounds
                    himself.
                Porter &amp;
                        Clarke (ed. 1903): Unseen and looking
                    for something else destroys himself.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Unseen may mean unknown or
                        unnoticed cf. LLL., V.ii.358 [2284], Sonn. CXVIII,[8], [OED, ppl.
                        a. 2] or ignorant (a sense not
                    otherwise recorded in Shakespeare, but cf. Shr., I.ii.131 [688–9], a schoolmaster /
                        Well seen in music) [OED,
                        Unseen ppl.
                        a. 3: Unskilled, inexperienced,
                    first citation 1606]. For inquisitive = eager for knowledge, cf.
                        [128] and n. . . .  The
                    punctuation of F . . . shows that the two adjectives go
                    together; and they must apply to the speaker, for the Ephesian Antipholus, who
                    is unaware of his brother’s existence, cannot be termed
                        inquisitive.
                Tillyard
                (1965, pp. 51–2): Here there is not only the slow melancholy cadence that
                    confirms the sentiment but the surprising collocation of unseen and inquisitive. Normally the
                    inquisitive person does not worry whether he is seen or not. But Antipholus
                    feels all the loneliness of a stranger at large in an alien city. . . .  Yet it
                    is his duty to be inquisitive, and the surprising collocation . . . expresses
                    both that duty and his despair of ever fulfilling it.
                Knowles
                (privately): I am inquisitive in a way not usually seen, obsessively
                    so, pointing to OED, ppl. a. 2: Not seen previously or hitherto;
                        esp. unfamiliar, strange, unknown, dismissing
                the comma as just a compositor’s addition, as so often happens. If that is so, it
                means the compositor was not familiar with the idiom and was trying to make sense of
                it. See n. 128–9.

            confounds] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821): Destroy,

                    (622–3) (OED, v. 1). Singer (ed. 1826) contradicts Malone, substituting: Overwhelmed, mixed confusedly together, lost (OED, v. 4). Halliwell (ed.
                1854): I Confounde, I distroye / je confons. Palsgrave, 1530. The other, and more
                    usual meaning [lost] . . . would also make good sense, and perhaps agrees
                    better with . . . lose myself (OED, v. 1, 4). Foakes (ed.
                1962): Mingles indistinguishably from the rest [citing R2 4.2.242 (2061) in Onions (1911)], but also
                    carrying the sense of mental confusion (OED, v. 4). Mowat &amp; Werstine (ed. 1996) note the etymology: confundere, to pour together.

            So . . . selfe] Cuningham (ed. 1907, p. xxvi) compares Warner’s
                (1595) translation: I holde it verie needful to be drawing home-ward, lest in
                        looking for your brother we quite lose ourselves (see ).
                Cuningham’s transcriptions vary in spelling and punctuation from Warner’s
                translation.

                (1932, p. 112): Inasmuch as the distressed father [sic] cannot know or take

                        unhappily lose myself, removing the modern comma after
                        unhappy and replacing the letters ea
                    with ly (written lie by
                    Shakespeare). In secretary script this would have been an easy
                    mistake.

            almanacke] Rann (ed. 1786): Register, being born at the same

                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Dromio, born at the same time as Antipholus, fixes the term of
                    [Antipholus’s] life like a calendar, comparing 1894. OED
                    (Almanac) cites MND 3.1.53
                    (864) to show that almanac and calendar were synonyms. Collier (ed.
                1842) points out, perhaps unnecessarily, that Antipholus mistakes E. Dromio for his
                own man. Wells (ed. 1972): In the circumstances [namely that he is
                    looking at the elder Dromio], the description is ironical.

                Abbott (§37)

                likely a verb here.
        


        208–32
            Return’d . . . messenger] Gill (1930, p. 28, on 208): [Menaechmi]
                    II.ii.276–277. Cylindrus is surprised at the speedy return of Menaechmus II, the
                    supposed guest. She means Menaechmus I, who had gone to the forum to
                complete some business. Foakes (ed. 1962): Mistiming is a feature of the
                    sequence of errors in the play, and here is nicely ironical in
                    relation to Antipholus’s confidence in Dromio as his
                    almanac.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Dromio’s energetic style brings a new tone into the play, marking the
                    assault of the unexpected upon Antipholus’s consciousness.
        


        208–17
            Return’d . . . day] Rushton (1867–8, 1:12–13) on She . . . day, quotes Puttenham on Clymax (1589; ed. Willcock &amp; Walker, 1936, p.
                208): The marching figure [or] the clyming figure, for Clymax is as much as to
                    say as a ladder, comparing AYL 5.2.33–41 (2441–50). Gill (1930, p. 28):
                        [Menaechmi] II.ii.286–287. Breakfast is
                    prepared at the home of Erotium. The Latin prandium is a
                midday meal; she vacillates between breakfast and
                    dinner.
                Hibbard
                (1981, pp. 90–1): These lines are not, I think, simply a matter of the
                    servant speaking blank verse because his master does, but rather of fun being
                    made out of the contrast between the rigid verse form and its prosaic content.
                        Furthermore . . . the Marching figure . . . that shapes the
                    narrative from line [212] to line
                        [215] is normally met with in
                    contexts that are quite unlike this one [e.g., FQ
                    2.12.71 and Spanish Tragedy 2.1.118–29]. . . . 
                    Whether the audience at the earliest performances of [Err.] did or did not associate Dromio’s lines with Balthazar’s [in
                        Spanish Tragedy]—and the popularity of Kyd’s play
                    makes it likely that some of them could have done so—they can hardly have been
                    unaware of the element of burlesque that the rhetorical figure brings with it
                    when the speaker is a servant and the subject a dinner that is growing
                    cold.
                Wells (ed.
                1972, p. 21): The [adagio] pace [of S. Antipholus’s preceding speech] changes
                    to a brisk allegro with the clattering entry of the Ephesian Dromio, whose blank
                    verse, with its end-stopped lines, its largely monosyllabic diction, its
                    rhythmic regularity, and its staccato sound effects (line [208] onwards), contrasts with the melancholy
                    enjambements and long vowels of Antipholus’s lament.
        


        209–59
            The . . . heeles] Wislicenus (1879, p. 95) compares Amphitruo 3.3 where Sosia mistakes Jupiter for his master. So does Gill (1930,
                p. 36). See n. 1074–97.
        


        210–16
            The . . . pray] Puns characterize the Dromios especially. McDonald
                (1996, p. 190): The other primary function of the pun [other than sheer
                    amusement] is to open a window onto the main ideas of a play, capturing in
                    individual words the conflicts and complex meanings of its characters’
                    experience. . . .  [In 1H4 disguised kings enter the
                    battlefield to confuse the enemy: visual puns.] So it is with double meanings in
                    those comedies based on the confusion of twins, The Comedy of
                        Errors and Twelfth Night. . . .  By
                    exploiting such confusing resemblances, Shakespeare stimulates his audience’s
                    sense of the richness of the world and reveals the perils of drawing premature
                    and certain conclusions about almost anything.
        


        210
            strucken] Abbott (§344) notes this as an irregular participial
                formation, comparing LLL 4.3.220
                    (1573) = strooken, JC
                    3.1.209 (1431) = strooken.

                Wells (ed.

                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): Did fast [in 215?] possibly awaken in Shakespeare’s mind associations
                        with . . . Mark 9.29, alluding to the casting out
                    of an evil spirit (This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and
                        fasting)? Variations on the phrase occur frequently in both
                Testaments.
        


        216–18
            pray . . . day . . . pray] The first rhyming triplet; see 588–90, 613–15, 638–40, 693–7 (depends on
                emendation), 711–14, 716–20, 733–6, 1260–3. A four–line rhyme occurs at 1174–7.
        


        217
            penitent] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821): Seems here to be used in
                    a double sense, and may either mean that they are sorry
                    for their master’s default, because they are obliged to fast; or that they are
                    sufferers by it, being obliged by his conduct, like penitents, to fast and pray (OED, sb. 3b, citing
                this line as the first occurrence).
        


        217
            default] Probably more than merely offence (Foakes, ed.
                1962). Schmidt (1874), Fault (OED, sb. 5). E. Dromio may
                feel the parasite’s anger at the failure in duty to appear at
                mealtime (5a); and there is a legal sense (in a play commentators find full of legal
                terms especially cogent for an audience of lawyers at Gray’s Inn): Failure to
                    act; neglect; spec. in Law
                (3a).

                        sb.1 11b, citing
                this line). Foakes (ed. 1962): Breath; perhaps alluding to the
                    emptiness of Dromio’s chatter, comparing 732. Wells (ed. 1972, Stop . . . winde): Shut up.

        229–30
            post . . . pate] Steevens (ed. 1778): Perhaps before writing
                    was a general accomplishment, a kind of rough reckoning concerning wares issued
                    out of a shop, was kept by chalk or notches on a post,
                    till it could be entered on the books of a trader, citing Jonson, Every Man In
                Q 3.3.37–9. OED (Post sb.1 5): The
                    door-post on which the reckoning at a tavern was kept; hence the account or
                    score, citing this line. Malone (ed. 1790) gets the OED meaning, citing Every Woman in her Humour
                (?Lewis Machin, 1607). Staunton (ed. 1857) cites 1H4 5.3.30–2 (2924–5). Foakes (ed. 1962): If he
                    returns without Antipholus, he will be brought to account for it.
        


        230
            scoure] Schmidt (1875, Score vb. 2): To mark or set down for an
                    account (OED, v. 3, citing this line). Wilson (ed. 1922, Glossary,
                Score): A quibble upon scour = beat (OED, v.2 9). O’Connor (1977, p. 67) observes Compositor
                D’s habit of misreading words, making Rowe’s (ed. 1709) score plausible. Werstine MS objects: Compositorial
                    misreadings are generally simplifications of complex MS readings; here, however,
                    the F1
                    scoure results in a much more complex pun on scoure/score than does the
                    emendation score. In F1 Dromio is saying
                        She will purge (scoure) your fault by beating (scouring) or cutting
                        (scoring) my head, as if I were the post or tally on which notches are cut
                        (scored) to record the number of drinks.

                Foakes (ed.
                1962): The error is presumably due to a simple misreading.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): [Clock] is supported by strike in [232].
                Steevens (in
                    Reed,
                ed. 1803): So, Plautus: —me puero
                            uterus erat solarium. See Aul[us] Gell[ius] [when I was a boy my stomack was a sundial (i.e., an
                        accurate clock), in The Attic Nights of Aulus
                        Gellius, tr. John C. Rolfe, 3 vols., 1927, 1:246]. The
                    Plautus is from a fragment, The Bœotian
                    Woman, according to Aulus Gellius. Collier (ed. 1842): [Clock] may be adopted, though cooks at dinner-time struck
                    on the dresser [i.e., kitchen counter to summon waiters], giving no
                evidence. Halliwell (ed. 1854): Massinger terms the dresser
                        the cook’s drum, in The Unnatural
                    Combat 3.1.21. Wilson (ed. 1922) thinks cooke may be a compositor’s mishearing of a dictated text.
        


        235
            gold] Tillyard (1965, pp. 64–6) is the first to write about thematic
                significance of gold, which (p. 66) keeps on attaching itself to Antipholus
                    of Syracuse; see . Cf. 236, 338, 339,

            Phœnix] Halliwell (ed. 1854) gives several examples
                of this well-known sign of houses in London, all much later than
                    Err.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): E. Antipholus was a merchant, and this was the sign of his
                    shop.
                Tannenbaum
                (1932, p. 119) denies that this could have been a shop sign: Had Antipholus’s
                    house been his shop, it would have had a public entrance, and he and his
                    companions could not have been shut out in III.1.
                Sugden
                (1925, p. 409): The sign of a tavern and of a shop in Lombard Street, quoting
                Jonson, Staple of News, Prologue for the Stage 16. Foakes (ed.
                1962): The image of this mythical bird, rising out of its own ashes to
                    renewed youth, is appropriate to the story of Antipholus and Adriana, whose love
                    is finally renewed out of the break-up of their marital relationship.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Antipholus’s house, also apparently his shop.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988) finds Foakes’s comment fanciful.
                Kolin
                (1997–8, p. 7) extends the transforming myth to S. Antipholus: [Luciana] does
                    indeed transform him into a new creature by fulfilling his dream of marrying her
                        ([1863]). Like the
                    self-perpetuating phoenix, Antipholus of Syracuse must die to the old man (his
                    brother’s twin), to become the new man he is (his brother’s twin). This is the
                    paradox of the phoenix myth, as well as the secret to solving the maddening
                    confusions in The Comedy of Errors. Kolin
                misleads a bit; Luciana is silent in response to S. Antipholus’s speech. See n. 1862–4.

            thousand Markes] Foakes (ed. 1962): This is the very sum needed to
                    ransom Egeon [25], and the emphasis
                    on Antipholus’s money, and his anger at his supposed loss of it, together with
                    Dromio’s quibbling on marks, are perhaps designed to enforce the
                    irony of the situation—Egeon’s son has the money which could redeem his father,
                    but is unaware of his father’s presence in Ephesus. Antipholus himself
                is at risk for the same amount should he be apprehended. See n. 25.

                and comments on each. For patience, cf. 306, 313,

            slaue] Foakes (ed. 1962) on 275: A common term of abuse, and often used jocularly meaning
                        fellow (cf. [270]), this word is employed here, and perhaps elsewhere in Errors, with overtones of the technical Latin meaning; in
                        Menaechmi, Messenio, the comic servant, is the
                    slave of Menaechmus Sosicles, cf. l. 251, illoc enim verbo esse me servom scio (Warner
                    translates this as now it appeares

                Wilson (ed.
                1922): Raught occurs seven times in Shakespeare and is always
                    spelt correctly elsewhere, except at L.L.L. 4.2.40 [1198] where the Q.
                    misprint rought gives rise to the F. reading
                        wrought.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): It may be the compositor’s misunderstanding of what he saw, or even a
                    Shakespearian spelling, noting LLL
                rought and citing Greg (1955, p. 222), who says LLL was set from Sh.’s foul papers. Compositor
                D set both words in F. Werstine (1988, p. 245) doubts that Err.
                F can be surely said to have been printed from Sh.’s foul
                    papers. Hence the (w)rought spelling may be as much Compositor D’s as Sh.’s.
        


        263–8
            They . . . sinne] Gill (1930, p. 34): [Amphitruo] II.ii.782. II.ii.844–846. II.i.604–605. Amphitruo and
                    Sosia think a sorcerer is at work. These lines draw commentary on such
                subjects as the definition and interpretation of the principal terms, the
                possibility of emendation, and the source, whether directly from Menaechmi or Warner’s translation. Theobald (ed. 1733) quotes a
                private communication from Warburton: The Epithet given to each of these
                    Miscreants should declare the Power by which they perform their Feats, and which
                    would therefore be a just Characteristick of each of them. Thus, by nimble Jugglers, we are taught that they perform their
                    Tricks by slight of hand: and by Soul-killing Witches, we are inform’d, the Mischief they do is by the
                    Assistance of the Devil to whom they have given their Souls: But then, by dark-working Sorcerers, we are not instructed in the
                    Means by which they perform their Ends. [Hence], we should read; Drug-working
                        Sorcerers. Theobald quotes Oth. 1.2.72–5 (290–3). Grey (1746,
                p. 4) favors F’s Darke: The Night
                    being the most proper Time for playing their hellish
                        Pranks.
                Heath (1765,
                p. 195): [Dark working] plainly denotes those who work by unknown powers,
                    such as charms, inchantments, talismans, and the like. And they are plainly
                    distinguished from the witches, as the epithet given these last implies that
                    they work by compact with the Devil, which the epithet under consideration
                    [Drug-working] doth not.
                Johnson (ed.
                1765): Perhaps the epithets have been only misplaced, and the lines should
                    read thus, Soul killing sorcerers . . . Dark-working witches. . . .  By soul-killing I
                    understand destroying the rational faculties by such means as make men fancy
                    themselves beasts.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1773): Witches or sorcerers themselves, as well as those who employed
                    them, were supposed to forfeit their souls by making use of a forbidden agency.
                    In that sense, they may be said to destroy the souls of others as well as their
                    own.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1778) compares Warner’s 1595 translation: For this assure your selfe,
                    this Towne Epidamnum, is a place of outragious expences,
                    exceeding in all ryot and lasciuiousnesse: and (I heare) as full of Ribaulds,

                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928 and Genetics, 1965, pp. 37–8) distinguishes among
                conjurer, sorcerer, and witch following the law of 5 Elizabeth 16 agaynst
                    Conjurac̄ons Inchantements and Witche craftes, quoting with slight
                variations Minsheu (1617): Coniuration in the Common Law is vsed for
                    such as haue personall conference with the Diuell or
                    euill spirit, to know any secret, or effect any purpose. . . .  And the
                    difference between Coniuration and Witchcraft, is, that the Coniurer seemeth by
                    praiers and inuocation of Gods powerfull names, to
                    compell the Diuell to say or doe what he commandeth him:
                    The Witch dealeth rather by a friendly and voluntarie
                    conference or agreement betweene him or her and the Diuell or Familiar. . . .  So that a Coniurer compacts for curiositie to know secrets, and
                    worke maruels; and the Witch of mere malice to doe
                    mischiefe: And both these differ from Inchaunters or Sorcerers, because the former two haue personall
                    conference with the Diuell, and the other meddles but
                    with Medicines and ceremoniall formes of words called Charmes, without apparition. See n. 2.

                of Reginald Scot’s Discovery of Witchcraft and those who
                affirmed the reality of witchcraft: Antipholus does not distinguish between
                    the histrionic and the satanic: confidence tricks, feats of prestidigitation,
                    and soul-killing witchcraft are jumbled together in a vision of dangerous,
                    sinful urban liberties. He says that Sh. in Err. is close to Scot’s skepticism, though in other plays he presents
                witches and the demonic without skepticism.

                    juggling, and the like, in which he was often assisted by a professional clown

            Actus Secundus] Foakes (ed. 1962): From l.
                        [284] to l. [317] [Adriana and Luciana] speak in rhyme, at first
                    in stichomythia, Luciana answering each line of [Adriana] by
                    completing a couplet; this is followed by Luciana’s speech, another exchange in
                    stichomythia, and a speech by Adriana roughly corresponding to that of Luciana,
                    who closes the sequence with a couplet. The same manner, and the rhyme, are
                    resumed l. [362], but there
                    Adriana’s argument turns to complaint, punctuated only by three sharp one-line
                    comments on her from Luciana. . . .  The mixed sequence of prose and verse
                    during Dromio’s presence on stage interrupts the pattern, being directly
                    concerned with forwarding the action, but though less formal, it is notable that
                    Dromio speaks in schemes and employs the colours of rhetoric, as in the
                    repetitions of his speech ll. [337–45]; see Thomas Wilson, Arte of Rhetorique 1560, ed. G. H. Mair (1919), pp. 176–7,

                    flourished initial long s, an abbreviation for the
                    letters ser, sir, sur, cer, cir, etc.; the compositor interpreted it as ser, its most common equivalent, though Shakespeare probably intended it
                    for surreptus. For Wilson’s (ed. 1922) abandoned
                theory that the spellings are evidence of a play intermediate in development

                    sister Luciana’s theory of the patient wife. Having suffered through the
                    practice of a wandering husband, Adriana mocks the woman who knows only the
                    clichés of the code. . . .  Here conversation becomes an acceptable form of
                    protest that ultimately socializes the two women: Adriana releases much of her
                    anger within the boundaries of the counter universe; Luciana learns a lesson
                    that prepares her for a future role.
                Candido
                (1990, pp. 225–6): Antipholus of Ephesus’s failure to come to dinner on time
                    is a repudiation of more than mere food; his absence from home is the first step
                    in the flouting of an accepted social ceremony that helps define his identity as
                    a respected citizen and respectful husband. . . .  Adriana’s behavior assumes a
                    deeper and more richly suggestive character than the mere ragings of a jealous
                    housewife. . . .  Adriana . . . is a fiercely combative woman confronting
                    squarely the threat of an imperiled marriage and determined to sustain
                    meaningful ties despite social and personal threats to her identity as wife and
                    Lady. Luciana’s urging them to dine at once reveals the severe
                    limitations of the unwedded woman’s easy aphorisms about marriage.

                    Adriana’s envy of a husband’s status [284] contravenes principles of order that for
                    Shakespeare and orthodox Elizabethans extended through the whole cosmos.
                Baldwin
                (1962, pp. 137–8) sees An Homilie of the state of Matrimonie as
                shaping Luciana’s sentiments: That wicked vice of stubburne wyll and
                        self-loue, is more meet to breake &amp; disseuer the loue of heart, than to
                        preserue concord (Homilies [i.e., Certaine Sermons . . .  (1587)], sig. 2G4v). Thus
                    Shakespeare reproduces the official position of the Homilies on the wife’s will. He also likens asses . . . so to Prov. 26:3
                    (Bishops’): Vnto the horse belongeth a whip, to the asse a bridle:

                (1986, p. 96): The general tenor of Luciana’s remarks is inconsistent with

                    literature, especially with that of the . . . Homilie of the state of

                expresses objections from a feminist-psychoanalytic reading: The brief
                    appearance of what might be taken for a female expansive self within such a
                    hierarchy cannot be egalitarian but only possessive [she is
                    commenting on 514–24 as well as on 284]. Luciana, on the other hand, Paul’s spokeswoman and advocate of the
                    divinely sanctioned hierarchy of mastery . . . can be called moderate or a
                    promoter of human commercial and civic freedom, I think, only by
                    presupposing, with Paul, that an essential, generic Man represents the condition
                    of all humans, for she urges conjugal (and, apparently, cosmic) harmony
                    according to a strict ordering in the service of male identity. See n.

                    Luciana seems at first to say that men can command their own time, and then to
                    take the opposite point of view again. Perhaps she means So far as we are
                        concerned, men will do as they please; but they are nevertheless subject to
                        the demands of time, and will come or go as their larger responsibilities
                        permit. Or, since Luciana says man, Time
                    is their master refers to both libertie and man; cf. 1H4

                    husbands, of the difference between the shrew and the patient wife. Its highly
                    rhetorical style, with the use of rhyme and stichomythia, owes much to the
                    example of [John] Lyly’s Euphues.

                enough in Ant. though it is not noticed by eds.). He offers

                    covering a female animal; cf. Lr. 3.4.86 (1866), Per. 4.6.44. He suggests that the number of possible
                sexual puns in Adriana’s speeches, esp. 536 ff., supports a psychoanalytic interpretation based on sexual
                frustration, such as that found in Feldman (1955).

                    certainly wrong, for not only stichomythia of the repartee, but the general
                    pattern of the verse here demands a rhyme.

                    especially an ass, being the most common form these take, cf. [595], [826–7]. Here the passage
                    implies that Adriana’s headstrong liberty is more beastly than
                    accepting the bridle of a husband’s authority, since even the beasts are
                        masters to their females [298]. For asse(s), cf. 595, 597, 633, 637,
                    678, 868, 1309,
                    1310.

            lasht] Foakes (ed. 1962): Scourged, continuing the image from
                        bridle and asses (OED, Lash v.1 6c, citing this line as the first figurative
                use: Rebuke . . . vituperate). Though no ed. adopts leashed, many prefer it. Steevens (ed. 1773):
                    Should it not rather be leash’d, i.e. coupled like
                    a head-strong hound? . . . The meaning . . . may be, that those who refuse the
                        bridle must bear the lash. . . .  However, . . . seamen still use lash
                    in the same sense with leash. Lace was the old English
                    word for a cord [OED (Lash v.2 2; Lace sb. 2a)].
                Rann (ed.
                1786), Mason
                (1798, p. 14), Knight (ed. 1842), Halliwell (ed. 1854), and Cuningham
                (ed. 1907) support or illustrate leash’d. Becket (1815,
                2:303) whimsically, though he identifies a reason why leashed
                is impossible: It may perhaps be asked—How can liberty be called headstrong if it is under any restraint? The meaning,
                    however, will be, not liberty which is headstrong, but
                    which would be such were it not checked or restrained by
                    woe. (The grammar being faulty from want of the conditional
                        form, the passage is rather obscure.)
                Carter
                (1905, p. 44) compares Prov. 5:22, Jer.
                    31:18, Wisd. 12:2. Barton (in Evans, ed.
                1974) keeps both: (1) Scourged; (2) bound.
        


        290–9
            There’s . . . accords] Gentleman (ed. 1774): Shakespeare appears to have had a very sensible,
                    consequently not a supercilious or tyrannical idea of female concessions, in the
                    state of wedlock.
                Wordsworth
                (1864, p. 195): It is a curious instance of our author’s tact that he employs
                    women to teach wives their conjugal duty.
                Carter
                (1905, p. 45) compares Gen. 1:26, 3:16, Heb. 2:7. Noble (1935, p. 107) compares Ps.
                    8:6–8, and Eccles. 3:19 (Bishops’ 1585: A
                    man hath no preeminence aboue a beast; cf. 297). Foakes (ed. 1962): In Genesis God gives Adam and Eve jointly dominion over the
                        fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle;
                    in the Psalm [8], more specifically, man and the son of man have
                    power, and God has put all things in subjection under his feet.
                    So Luciana is putting the passages to special use in applying them to the
                    relations of husband and wife. Commentators since Bullough (1957, 1:9–10) have
                added Eph. 5 to the list of biblical influences. Fripp (1930,
                p. 99) quotes Ovid, Metamorphoses (a mine of
                    material for his plays) 1.69–79, that part of the creation story
                involving animals, fish, birds, and humans. Baldwin (1950, p. 62):
                    It is certain that Shakspere has at times had at least one eye on
                Arthur Golding’s translation of Ovid, 1565, bk. 1; Baldwin does not explain just
                what Sh. saw in Golding, but common to Err. and Golding are
                    bound (boundes of things, 79); Man more diuine (creature . . . Farre more
                    devine, 87–8); Lord of the wide world (Of
                    all the residue should be the Lord, 90), as well as the more expected
                    fowles and beasts. Altman (1978,
                p. 170): This is the reasoned hierarchical view, but it illustrates the
                    reductiveness of argument a
                    thesi, for it provides but cold comfort before the particulars of
                    Adriana’s experience. It is even more ironic, however, in its relation to
                    Luciana. She is totally unseasoned in matters of domestic relations, and moments
                    later confesses a fear of the marriage bed. . . .  The debate ends unresolved,
                    as do the other positions expressed in the play—which only emphasizes the fact
                    that each character understands his situation in his own way and
                    will not be moved to change.
                Brooks
                (1961, p. 66) compares Shr.
                    5.2.154–5 (2732–3); Wells (ed. 1972) compares Shr. 5.2.135–78 (2695–737). Grennan
                (1980, p. 151): This eloquent secular sermon on degree . . . represents a
                    world of meticulous symmetries, as esthetically rigid (situate)
                    as the solid couplets themselves.
        


        290
            situate] Schmidt (1875): Placed, lying (OED, Situated ppl.
                    a.). See n. 24. Used by Sh. only here and in LLL 1.2.137 (439).

            his bound] I.e., its limits. Halliwell (ed. 1854) compares Job 26:10: He hath compassed the waters with bounds (OED, sb. 2a,
                3b).

        294
            Man] See textual note 294–7. Sisson (1956, 1:90) defends F: Man is a collective noun. And it is Man that is wanted here. It is mankind that is in question, as
                    contrasted with the animal world, not men as individuals. But see 299.
        


        296
            intellectuall . . . soules] Schmidt (1875, Sense 5): Power of
                    sound reasoning (OED, Reason sb.1 10). Baldwin
                (1962, p. 139): Shakespeare’s phrase belongs to the psychological jargon of
                    his time. . . .  By virtue of the intellectuall sence, the third
                    of his souls, man is above all other creatures. . . .  The natural conclusion
                    to this syllogism of analogy is that men also Are masters to their
                        females, and their Lords [298]. The other two souls are the vegetative (which gives
                life but no feeling) and the sensitive (which gives feeling but no reason).

            keepe] OED (v. 39b) cites this as the first occurrence of the sense of
                    remain.
        


        300

        301
            Not . . . bed] Haines (1978, p. 110) thinks the line is baffling and wonders
                if Luciana is a widow who had found her husband incompatible, because if
                    Luciana is simply, as a decent virgin, slightly apprehensive about the marriage
                    bed, ought she to [use] troubles? . . . [She] seems to have a
                    passionate interest in adultery (it forms the general subject of about 22 of her
                    43 speeches), and this line might be read as one more . . . allusion to
                    [it].
                Mowat &amp;
                        Werstine (ed. 1996): There may be an
                    echo here of St. Paul’s statement that all who marry shall have trouble
                        in the flesh (1 Corinthians
                        7.28).
        


        301
            marriage bed] OED (trans.: Marital intercourse, with its rights and
                        duties), citing this line as the first occurrence.
        


        302
            wold] Perhaps not only predictive but also volitive: You would wish
                    to.
                Schmidt
                (1875, Will vb. II.1): Would as subjunctive (vellem)
                    expressing a present wish (OED,
                        v.1 41).
        


        303
            obey] Noble (1935, p. 109) cites the matrimony service in the Book
                of Common Prayer: Wilt thou obey him . . . ?
        


        304
            start . . . where] See Abbott §291 for several examples of intransitive
                verbs (start) made transitive. Cf. 380. Foakes (ed. 1962): [Start] is probably derived from the idea of a horse
                        starting, or swerving off its course (OED, v. 5b). Johnson (ed.
                1765) conjectures hare, comparing Ado 1.1.184 (179). Clark &amp; Wright (ed. 1863): Johnson’s ingenious conjecture may
                    have been suggested . . . by . . . [AYL 4.3.18 (2166)]. But the received reading . . . is
                    perhaps confirmed by [793].
                Hudson (ed.
                1880), reading hare, compares 1H4 1.3.198 (521). Irving &amp; Marshall (ed. 1888) compare Marlowe, Dido 4.2.37: Mine eye is fix’d where fancy cannot start [ed. 1973, 1:40]; by which
                    Iarbus . . . means to say his eye is fix’d on one from whom his
                    love can never stray. Adriana here begins suggesting that E. Antipholus
                is adulterous, or at least that she believes he is; see also 384, 506.
                He denies that his meetings with the Courtesan are sexual (772–4), a denial accepted by most
                critics.
        


        304
            other where] Schmidt (1875, Otherwhere): In or to another
                    place (OED, adv. c). Steevens (ed. 1773): Where has here the power of a noun. . . .  The
                    sense is, How, if your husband fly off in pursuit of some
                        other woman?, citing Lr. 1.1.261 (286), Rom. 1.1.198 (206), H8 2.2.59 (1096).
        


        305
            forbeare] Schmidt (1874, intr. 2b): Be patient (OED, v. 8c intr. [or absol.]).
        


        306
            Patience] The line is either descriptive about the allegorized virtue
                Patience or astonished or satirical about such untested patience. Sanderson
                (1974, p. 605): Patience is a virtue whose absence among several main
                    figures . . . promotes, perpetuates, and augments the errors
                    bedeviling Ephesus and a virtue whose cultivation helps make possible the
                    resolution of conflicts . . . and the eventual enjoyment of those ministrations
                    of a benign Providence which despite man’s frowardness, the play seems to
                    suggest, eventually brings clarification out of bafflement, happiness out of
                    adversity, indeed, life out of death. Cf. 313, 315,
                    746, 755, 1121,
                    1647.
        


        306
            pause] Johnson (ed. 1765): To rest, to be in quiet
                    (OED, v.1 1). Foakes (ed. 1962): Take time for
                    consideration (i.e. before getting married); cf. MND., I.i.83 [92].
                Wells (ed.
                1972): In her incredulity Adriana moves into the third person, perhaps
                    addressing the audience.
                Baldwin
                MS: Pause echoes unmov’d. For Patience is
                    Luciana, who pauses unmov’d, unexasperated, because she has no
                    cause not to be patient.
        


        307
            cause] Foakes (ed. 1962): Ground of action; or perhaps, as
                    Abbott, 12, explains, no cause otherwise than for
                        meekness (OED, sb. 3).
        


        308–9
            A . . . crie] Proverbial; see Tilley (A124): All commend patience
                    but none can endure to suffer.
                Dent (1981)
                marks it as of questionable relevance to the passage. Douce (in Steevens, ed.
                1793) compares Ado 5.1.20–2
                    (2099–101), 27–8 (2106–7). Dorsch (ed.
                1988) adds Ado 5.1.35–6
                    (2114–15).
        


        311
            our selues complaine] The spacing may indicate a reflexive sense of complaine rather than an intransitive one; OED (v. 2 refl.): To bewail oneself, lament, utter one’s
                    lamentations.
        


        312
            vnkinde mate] Carter (1905, pp. 45–6) cites Job 6:14,
                    16:1 and 6, 2:9, as well as the prefatory ARGVMENT
                in the Geneva version: For this holy man Job was not onely extremely
                    afflicted in outward[e] things . . . but also in his minde and conscience, by
                    the sharpe tentations of his wife[,] and chiefe friends[:] which by their
                    vehement wordes and subtil disputations broght him almost to
                despaire.
        


        312
            vnkinde] Both lacking in kindness and
                    unnatural (OED, a. 6, 2b). Usually stressed on the first syllable
                before a substantive. Cf. 1127.
        


        312
            greeue] Schmidt (1874, Grieve 1a): To afflict, to

        313
            helpelesse] Malone (ed. 1790): By exhorting me to patience, which
                        affords no help, citing Ven. 604 (OED, a. 3, quoting this
                line).
        


        313
            patience] Foakes (ed. 1962): Perhaps proverbial; cf. Tilley
                (P108): Patience is a remedy for every grief (sorrow), and R71:
                    There is no Remedy but patience. Neither Tilley nor Dent (1981)
                lists Err. as using this proverb. Foakes (p. xliv, n. 1):
                    Adriana and her husband are alike in their proneness to anger, their
                        impatience, or lack of patience, words used in
                    relation to them several times; see [283, 746, 1122, 1300–1, 1368–89]. See n. 306.
        


        314
            bereft] Schmidt (1874, Bereave 4): To impair, to spoil
                    (OED, v. 2).
                    Foakes
                (ed. 1962): If you live to see your rights as a wife stripped from
                    you, comparing for right
                1110 and MND 1.1.97 (106). Rann (ed. 1786):
                    Infringed, invaded, is not attested by OED.

            foole-beg’d patience] Schmidt (1874, Fool-begged): Idiotical,
                    stupid . . . (properly so foolish that the guardianship of it might well
                        be begged. Nares. cf. Beg. Might it not be
                    simply: such patience begged, demanded foolishly?).
                OED, Beg v. 5a:
                        To beg a person: to petition the Court of
                    Wards (established by Hen. VIII, and suppressed under Chas. II) for the custody
                    of a minor, an heiress, or an idiot, as feudal superior or as having interest in
                    the matter; hence also fig. To beg (any one) for a fool or idiot: To take him
                    for, set him down as, a fool; Fool sb.1 and a. 6: Special comb.,
                    as fool-begged a., with cross-reference to Beg
                5a. Proverbial; Tilley (F496): Let him be begged for a Fool.
                Eds. divide on four senses: 
                    (1) As OED (5a): Johnson (ed. 1765); Halliwell (ed. 1854); Cuningham (ed. 1907), with reservations about the Court of
                        Wards, but citing John Lyly, Mother Bombie 1.1.37
                        [ed. 1902, 3:174]: I’ll beg him for a fool; Foakes
                        (ed. 1962); Wells (ed. 1972); Dorsch (ed. 1988).
                    (2) Capell (1774, p. 72): Unfit for those that have
                            understanding and feeling. So Rann (ed. 1786).
                    (3) Cuningham (ed. 1907): The phrase [may be]
                            equivalent to fool-begging, i.
                                e. . . .  very exemplary patience indeed, comparing
                            deformed = deforming (1779).
                    (4) Levin (ed. 1965): I.e., assumed as one would assume
                            responsibility for a fool.
                
            Baldwin
                MS: Since helplesse Patience does not help or profit, it is
                    foolish to beg it, as one begged some fools because they were
                    profitable. See n. 306.

            left] Collier (ed. 1858): Abandoned (OED, Leave v. 9). Wright &amp;
                        LaMar (ed. 1963): I.e., your only
                    consolation, with a pun on left and right [314].
                Either interpretation is attractive, though no one follows Wright &amp; LaMar.

                proof.
        


        319–61
            Say . . . leather] Wilson (ed. 1922): Note the mixture of prose
                    and verse in this section, Dromio sometimes speaking prose and sometimes
                    verse.
                Vickers
                (1968, p. 8): When a person from a superior class talks with the clown then
                    he too descends to prose, as if to show the pervasive effect of clownish
                    wit. . . .  A similar confusion of the appropriate form is seen [here], where
                    the entry of Dromio of Ephesus reduces both Adriana and Luciana to prose as one
                    would expect . . . only for all three to revert to verse at once.

            at too hands] I.e., two hands. OED
                    (Hand sb. 25f): At close quarters in
                    conflict; fighting hand to hand (with).
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): It is just possible that F. may be correct, if we
                    suppose that to be at to-hands was a current expression,
                citing OED. Foakes (ed. 1962): A quibble on at
                        hands, fighting at close quarters, and a reference to Dromio’s
                    beating at [260–1].
                Knowles
                (privately): A further pun, beating me with both hands, on both my
                    ears?
                OED’s last example of the too
                spelling is dated 1564. A Compositor C spelling.

                    under them. This quibble . . . has been already [sic; Steevens dates TGV before Err.] introduced in
                    the Two Gentlemen of Verona
                        [2.5.28 (901)] (OED,

            doubtfully] Foakes (ed. 1962): Ambiguously, and, in the second
                    instance, dreadfully, quibbling on the sense of doubtful, at
                        [71] (OED, a. 1, 3). Capell (1774,

                Not supported by OED. Rann (ed. 1786):
                    Violently. Not supported by OED. Collier
                (1853, p. 79): By the misprint of doubtfully, for doubly . . . the humour of one of Dromio’s replies has
                    been entirely lost. . . .  The blows were so doubly
                    powerful that Dromio could hardly stand under them.
                Lettsom
                (1853, p. 191) and Dyce (ed. 1857) point out that to speak doubly
                is to speak deceitfully. The Clarkes (ed. 1864): Dromio uses this
                    word punningly in reference to two that it sounds something
                        like—doughtily and redoubtably; meaning
                    valorously, formidably. Sh. uses only doughty handed (Ant. 4.8.5 [2653]).

            It . . . wife] Greenblatt et al. (ed. 1997) compares 1 Cor. 7:32–3: The unmarried man careth for the
                    things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord: But he that is married careth

            horne mad] Halliwell (ed. 1854): And no more than as a
                        bull’s roaring and bellowing, and running horne-mad at every one in his way,
                        when he is wounded by the dogges, and almost bayted to death,
                    Nashe’s Have with you to Saffron Waldron 1596 [in ed. McKerrow, 3:27]. The
                    expression was very common, and frequently used without any allusion to
                    cuckoldism.
                Tannenbaum
                (1932, p. 120), oddly: May be a pun on whorin’ mad.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Quibbling . . . on the imaginary horns cuckolds were said to
                    wear (OED, a. and b., citing this line as the first
                occurrence). See Tilley (H628): He is Horn-mad.
                Mowat &amp;
                        Werstine (ed. 1996, pp. 165–6): The
                    association of cuckolds with horns growing from the forehead goes back to
                    ancient times and may orginate with the early and prevalent practice of
                        grafting the spurs of a castrated cock on the root of the excised
                        comb, where they grew and became horns, sometimes of several inches
                        long (OED
                        horn 7a).

            Horne . . . mad] Wright (1988, p. 312) lists these lines as a single
                line employing an epic caesura: A line with an extra syllable before a
                    midline pause, along with 1009 and 1528–9; he notes that Chambers (1930, 2:400) says there are no such lines

        336–43
            But . . . he] Miriam Joseph (1947, p. 66): Heterogenium is the vice
                    of answering something utterly irrelevant to what is asked. This vice is used
                    with fine dramatic effect [here]. The irrelevance occasioned by the confusion of
                    the twin brothers is much more sharply pointed in this recital than it was in
                    the encounter itself, and appears more ridiculous.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): This is not a strictly accurate account of what happened when
                    Antipholus of Syracuse asked Dromio of Ephesus for his gold, but rather a
                    conflation of the happenings of [208–61].
                Knowles
                (privately): It’s not just a conflation, but a comic embroidery, by an
                    inventive uppity servant taking revenge on the master who has beaten him and the
                    mistress who is upbraiding him.
        


        338
            hundred] Thirlby MS (1725–33): Perhaps wrote at first in figures
                    and thence the mistake, i.e., Compositor C read something like 1000 as
                100. Cf. thousand

                    White (ed.
                1857): [Home was] probably passed over in MS. on account of
                    its similarity to the word immediately before it. No emendation is
                necessary; for short lines, see Abbott §511.

            hang vp] Foakes (ed. 1962): An imprecation (= to hell with!),
                    from hanging on a gibbet, cf. Rom., III.iii.57 [1859] (OED, v. 29c).
        


        345
            I . . . mistresse] See textual notes. Steevens (ed. 1793): I
                    suppose this dissonant line originally stood thus: I know no mistress; out upon thy mistress!
                Irving &amp; Marshall (ed. 1888): We must place the accent
                    on the second syllable of the first mistress . . . if
                    the verse is not to be an utterly unrhythmical one. Steevens would read [as
                    above], a very plausible suggestion. It is not unusual to find the same word
                    accented differently, when occurring in more than one place, even if close
                    together. . . .  In Pericles, ii.5.18 [966], we
                    find mistress used with the accent on the last
                    syllable. . . .  In line 73 [1025] . . . it is
                    used with the usual accent.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): There are, apparently, some fifteen passages . . . in which the
                    word mistress occurs, viz. [211, 221, 228, 241, 248, 333, 344, 345, 348, 405, 413, 506, 815, 1232, 1641; he does not
                    locate 1156, 1262, 1325, 1380, 1653, 1658], and in no single instance is the word
                    accented on the second syllable. . . .  Marshall instances Pericles . . . to the contrary, but this passage is not
                    Shakespeare’s.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): This simple transposition of the negative [i.e., F],
                    which ruins the verse, may be due to the compositor.
                Idem (ed.
                1962) withdraws. Foakes (ed. 1962): Usually emended . . . but the force
                    of the passage lies in the echoing mistress at the end of each
                    phrase. Dromio embroiders considerably on what Antipholus actually said, cf.
                        [247–56].
                Wells &amp; Taylor (1987, p. 267) on Foakes: But in the
                    preceding line mistresse is followed by sir, and
                    so there can be no obstacle to its being followed here by not.
                    F offers the more common (but less metrical) word
                    order.

            out on] Schmidt (1875, Out adv. 1): An interjection expressive

        347–50
            Quoth . . . there] For verse set as prose, see , where the setting of
                unindented flow-overs that disguise verse lines is discussed, chiefly in the work of
                Compositor B (here, Compositor C). The textual notes show that before eds. begin
                numbering lines, it is often impossible to tell whether an ed. regarded the line(s)
                as prose or verse.

            my . . . shoulders] Wright &amp; LaMar (ed.

            arrant] OED (Errand) attests

                    str[ong]).

            breake . . . a-crosse] Schmidt (1874, Break vb. I trans. 1 to break the head): To crack the skin of the head, so
                    that the blood comes (OED, v. 5b, citing this line).
        


        355–6
            And . . . head] See textual note 355. Wells (ed. 1972): F reads
                        And, as always whether the word means modern
                        and or if. Editors take it in the former
                    sense, punctuating the lines as two independent statements. The reading adopted
                    here seems more in keeping with Dromio’s resiliently ironical
                attitude.

            blesse yt crosse] Delius (ed. 1858): Wordplay
                between across (354) = obliquely through, and cross = sign of the
                cross, i.e., with the hand as a sign of devotion (Ger.). Carter (1905, p. 46):
                    Dromio’s Puritan quip at the making of the Sign of the Cross.

                        holy is broken, full of holes
                    (quibbling).

            round] Johnson (ed. 1765): He plays upon the word round, which signifieth spherical
                    applied to himself, and unrestrained, or free in speech or action, spoken
                    of his mistress (OED, a. 13). Miriam Joseph (1947, p. 166):
                    Syllepsis is the use of a word having simultaneously two different
                    meanings, although it is not repeated.
        


        359
            foot-ball] Dyer (1884, p. 407) cites Lr. 1.4.86 (616): It does not appear among the
                    popular exercises before the reign of Edward III.; and then, in 1349, it was
                    prohibited . . . because it impeded the progress of archery. The
                    danger . . . attending this pastime occasioned James I. to say [Basilikon Doron, ed. J. Craigie (1944, 1: 189)],
                        From this Court I debarre all rough and violent exercises, as the
                        football, meeter for laming than making able the users
                    thereof. See Vale (1977, p. 112) for further disapproval of the
                game.

            hither] Tannenbaum (1932, p. 113): Elizabethan and Jacobean
                    texts often print hether for hither. In this
                    passage the rhyme requires hether (OED attests to the pronunciation in the 15th–17th c.).

        363–77
            His . . . stale] Scragg (1988, pp. 147–51) compares the verse style
                and lexicon of these lines with 1775–1800 to show how the rhymed couplets, heavy
                end-stopping, regular blank verse (sic; here rhymed iambic pentameter), and formal
                diction of the first passage assures the audience that it ought not to worry too
                much about Adriana’s plight, whereas the varied metrics, unexpectedly rich imagery,
                and simple diction of the second increase the audience’s sympathy.
        


        363–4
            His . . . looke] Cuningham (ed. 1907, p. xxv) compares Warner’s
                (1595) translation: Men. We that have Loves abroad, and wives at home, are miserably hampred,
                    yet would every man could tame his shrewe as well as I doo mine (see

                    1440–1? Or does she believe
                that he is adulterous? In the badly garbled passage 383–91, esp. 384, she perhaps again makes the charge, but the syntax
                offers the possibility that she is making a hypothesis. See also 773, E. Antipholus’s disclaimer.

                    unkindness of Antipholus of Ephesus which has blunted Adriana’s formerly sharp
                    discourse to make it dull, and has marred her voluble wit to make it
                    barren.

                    Literally, ruins, but passing here into the sense loss of
                        beauty,
                    disfigurement, as at [1780] and Ven.,
                        736, the only other places where Shakespeare uses the word. Cf.
                    1780.
        


        374
            faire] Steevens (ed. 1773): The adjective . . . fair for fairness, citing
                    MND 1.1.182 (194); in ed.
                1778 he adds Ven. 1086, Son. 68.3, 83.2; OED (a. 1). Singer (ed. 1826): Fair, strictly speaking, is not used here for fairness . . . ; but for beauty. Shakspeare
                    has often employed it in this sense, without any relation to whiteness of skin or complexion.
                Abbott
                (1870, p. 5): In Elizabethan English, almost any part of speech can be used
                    as any other part of speech.
        


        376–7
            vnruly . . . home] Madden (1897, pp. 234–5): Here and there a
                        park ribbed and paled in [Cym. 3.1.19 (1398)] confined the deer with
                    barrier impassable, save by some errant buck, of whom the keeper might say, as
                    Adriana of her husband [quoting].
        


        376
            Deere] The pun on dear is noted by Johnson (ed.
                1765) and by Malone (in Steevens, ed. 1778), citing Ven. 229–31.

        377
            stale] Johnson (ed. 1765): Not something offered to allure or attract, but something
                        vitiated with use, something
                    of which the best part has been enjoyed and consumed.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1773) disagrees: The same as the French word chaperon. Poor I am but the cover for his
                        infidelity.
                Idem (ed.
                1778): Stale to catch these thieves in
                        The Tempest [4.1.187
                        (1861)], undoubtedly means a fraudulent bait.
                    Here it seems to imply the same as a stalking-horse, pretence. I am, says Adriana, but his pretended wife, the mask under which he covers his amours. He
                quotes Warner’s (1595) translation: He makes me a stale and a laughing stocke
                    to all the world (see ); (OED, stale sb.3 6, quoting this line). Singer (ed.
                1826) supports Johnson: The dictionaries, in voce Exoletus, countenance this explanation [e.g., Cooper (1565):
                            Reliqui domi exoletam
                            virginam. I lefte at home a stayle mayde].
                Commentators after Singer agree on Steevens’s sense decoy, but not on
                what kind of decoy. Cuningham (ed. 1907): This word has several meanings,
                    which, however, do not seem to be capable of exact definition, and are more or
                    less blended in meaning, the sense of something standing
                    being more or less common to all. [He summarizes, with copious illustration:]
                    (1) A decoy or bait . . . either a real bird, or the form of a bird set up as a
                    lure. . . .  (2) A stalking-horse, a pretense, a mask. . . .  (3)
                    Laughing-stock, dupe. . . .  (4) A cant term for a prostitute. . . .  (5) The
                    urine of horses. . . .  (6) The more modern sense of the word [i.e., lacking in
                    freshness].
                Bevington
                (ed. 1988): Rejected lover who has become a laughing-stock.
                Kökeritz
                (1953, pp. 115–16): A whore is a stale who may steal and stale well, whereas a horse will, of course,
                        stale at times but hardly steal. He thinks steal and stale rhyme. Cercignani (1981, p. 158): Such -ea-, long -a rhymes must all be dismissed as
                    unquestionably unreliable.

        382
            chaine] Cuningham (ed. 1907, p. xxvii) points out that Warner (1595)
                and Sh. translate Plautus’s spinter (bracelet) as
                    chain.
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928, p. xvii, n. 1): A bracelet is not spectacular enough for the stage
                    duty to which Shakespeare wishes to put this piece of jewelry, so he changes it
                    to a chain, seemingly of aldermanic proportions. . . .  [Warner also
                    substitutes chain for bracelet] for no apparent reason unless it be whim, or an
                    echo of Shakespeare.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): This is probably a coincidence, and due to the popular fashion of the
                    time of wearing chains of gold or jewels round the neck (see [Macquoid
                    in] Shakespeare’s England, II: 115–17), as well as to
                    the greater prominence of a chain on stage; cf. [1474], where Antipholus of Syracuse comes on stage
                    wearing it. (OED, sb.1 3). [Menaechmi is a play too, where the bracelet would have to be
                seen, though Menaechmus Surreptus had also stolen his wife’s palla
                (cloak), a garment of great prominence, as well as her bracelet.]
                    Henze
                (1971, p. 35): It naturally symbolizes the cohesion of society as it asserts
                    its orderly supremacy over prostitutes, wayward husbands, shrewish wives, and
                    lost brothers. The chain is called a Carkanet at
                    622, which probably indicates that
                it was richly decorated. Cf. 776, 778, 955, 958,
                    960, 969, 971,

                    xxvi) compares Warner’s (1595) translation: Desire him of all love to come over quickly to my house (see ). Wells (ed. 1972): Presumably the
                        general sense is either I would not mind if he kept that (the
                            chain) or I wish that he would keep his love to
                            himself. Since none of the proposed alterations seems
                        satisfactory, F’s reading is preferred here, awkward though
                        it is, in the possibility that it is intended to mean Would that he
                            kept his (other) love to himself provided that. . . . 
                    Dorsch
                    (ed. 1988), reading a love him: It is tempting to suppose
                        that the compositor was disposed to set up he would detain by
                        the parallel with he would keep in the following line. The
                        two lines would then mean, Would that only a love-affair kept him
                            from me, provided that he kept on good terms with his (legitimate)
                            wife. This may be awkward, but it is no more so than the
                        alternatives so far proposed. But if Adriana is willing to allow
                    adultery, why is she jealous, 376–81, or why would she die weeping (391)?

                        would only detain from me the chain alone. The Clarkes (1879, p. 660):
                        A marked peculiarity in Shakespeare’s style is the fearless mode in
                        which he frequently repeats the same word or words in a line, phrase or
                        speech; thereby giving an emphatic effect to the passage, citing
                    many passages including Luc.
                        795, But I alone, alone must sit and pine, and Jn. 3.1.170 (1097). Porter

                (3) Various emendations; see textual note and Unadopted Conjectures. The defenses of the emendations range from the
                    fairy tale to the plausible. Knight (ed. 1842): The meaning is—I would
                        the chain alone would detain his love—hold his love to me: Would that
                            alone his love it would detain.
                    Cuningham (ed. 1907): o’love,

                        possibly with reference to keep fair quarter in the next
                        line, comparing MND
                        2.2.154 (809), and other examples of of all loves.
                    Stewart
                    (1914, pp. 238–9): The love referred to is the chain

                    Foakes
                    (ed. 1962), crediting Kellner: toie is close
                        enough to loue in secretary hand for confusion to be
                        possible, since a looped t may easily look like l (cf. lime for time, H8, V.i.37 [2815]), and minim letters are rarely
                        clear.

            I . . . shame] The most garbled passage in the play. Baldwin (1962, p. 140):
                    The matter . . . come[s] from the official homilies of
                    the day, where The second part of the Sermon against adultery
                    laments what corruption commeth to mans soule thorough the sinne of
                        adultery (Homilies, [i.e., Certaine Sermons . . . , 1587], sig. K6) and asks, Is not
                        that treasure, which before all other is most regarded of honest persons,
                        the good fame &amp; name of man and woman, lost through
                    whordom? But that does not solve the textual crux. Theobald
                (letter to Warburton, 19 Nov. 1729, in Nichols, 1817, 2:293) asks for help with Where and By (388–9). Theobald (ed. 1733): In
                    this miserably mangled Condition is this Passage exhibited in the first Folio. All the Editions since have left out the last
                    Couplet of it; I presume, as too hard for them. Mr. Pope,
                    who pretends to have collated the first Folio, should
                    have spar’d us the Lines, at least, in their Corruption.—I communicated my
                    doubts upon this Passage to my Friend Mr. Warburton; and
                    to his Sagacity I owe, in good part, the Correction of it. The Sense of the
                    whole is now very pertinent; which, without the two Lines from the first Folio, was very imperfect; not to say, ridiculous. The
                    Comparison is fully Closed. Gold, indeed, bides handling well; but, for
                        all that, often Touching will wear even Gold: So, no Man of a great
                        Character, even as pure as Gold, but may in Time lose it by Falsehood and
                        Corruption.
                Warburton
                (ed. 1747): [As Theobald, then] just so the greatest character, tho’ as pure
                    as gold itself, may, in time, be injured, by the repeated attacks of falsehood
                    and corruption.
                Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821): Wear is used as a dissyllable. See the
                    Essay on Shakspeare’s Metre. The commentator last mentioned [Steevens], not
                    perceiving this, reads—and so no man &amp;c. . . .  The
                    observation concerning gold is found in . . . [Richard Edwards] Damon and
                    Pithias, 1582: —gold in time does wear away, And other precious things do fade:
                        friendship does ne’er decay.
                Irving &amp; Marshall (ed. 1888; see Unadopted Conjectures 388–9): The man who is the
                        jewel of her love, will lose his
                        beauty, i.e. the many charms with which her love
                    had invested him; yet the gold, i.e. the setting of the jewel, the real man,
                        bides (remains) still. The jewel, being enamelled, would not be a precious stone,
                    and therefore of less intrinsic value than the gold
                    setting. The other three lines, which are manifestly corrupt, might then read
                    thus: That others touch, and often touching will Wear
                        gold; so any man that hath a name By falsehood and corruption doth it
                        shame; in which case the only alterations of the original text would
                    be in the punctuation; and the substitution of wear for
                        where, and so any for and no (the and having very likely
                    been copied from the line above. The meaning of touch may
                    be to assay [OED,
                            v. 8a] or to defile
                        [OED, v.
                        2a]. But, in any case, the author seems to have neglected to carry out
                    the simile he originally intended.
                Herford
                (ed. 1899): The best enamelled jewel tarnishes; but the gold setting keeps
                    its lustre however it may be worn by the touch; similarly, a man of assured
                    reputation, can commit domestic infidelity without blasting it [i.e., his
                    reputation].
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907, pp. 125–7): The exact meaning of this vexed and difficult
                    passage—difficult owing to the concise expression of the simile intended, and
                    the necessities of the verse—may perhaps be most clearly arrived at by a formal
                    tabular analysis of its several terms [he uses parallel columns]; those in
                    italics showing the terms Shakespeare does not express and leaves to the
                    comprehension of his hearers. . . .  [Col. 1] I see
                            the best enamelled jewel (e.g. a ring) Will
                            lose its beauty (by the wearing of the enamel); Yet the gold
                            (setting), That others touch, (And, in fact, often touching
                            will cause the gold to wear) Still remains gold; &lt;And just as no gold (setting) well enamelled is spoilt
                                by the wear of the enamel&gt; 
                            [Col. 2] I find the man (husband) best endowed
                                with moral qualities
                            Will lose these qualities (by temptation);
                            Yet the real man (husband),
                            That other women tempt,
                            (And frequent temptation will corrupt him in the
                                end)
                            Still remains one’s husband;
                            So no man of assured reputation is shamed by his falsehood and
                            corruption.
            Since, therefore, my husband’s reputation is unassailable, and my beauty has faded and ceased to please him, I have no
                    resource but to weep and die. . . . 
            Some authorities take gold to mean gold coin;
                        touch then referring to its currency.
            Wilson (ed.
                1922): There have been many attempts to emend it, e.g. Theobald reads
                        wear for where, and all mod. edd. follow,
                    ignoring the fact that touching will wear gold flatly contradicts
                    the gold bides still that others touch. We explain the corruption
                    by a cut of two or more rhyming lines [between gold and and No man].
                Idem (ed.
                1962) withdraws. Baldwin (ed. 1928): If, to mend the meter, we insert an
                    accented monosyllable following and—Theobald suggested
                        so—the line still fails to make sense. . . .  The
                    contrast is clearly between the easily tarnished enamel and the enduring gold.
                    Adriana has just previously pointed out that, while she suspects the eye of
                    Antipholus of doing homage elsewhere, yet she can endure that, if only he be not
                    false to his marriage bed. The number of others who touch him merely in the way
                    of good fellowship and flirtation will tarnish the beauty of the enamel indeed,
                    but will not injure the true gold, however often it may be touched. The
                    application would be that, if Antipholus is true gold, the enamel of reputation
                    may indeed be tarnished, but the gold of character will not be affected. We thus
                    need a condition to begin line 112 [388], that condition being present in Where, which
                    accordingly would appear to be the correct word. . . .  We must have a word
                    which can naturally be more heavily accented than gold.
                    This principle rules out all the suggested words except abides, resides, is
                        there. He prefers abides.
            Sisson (1956,
                1:91): Alexander retains the Folio reading, re-punctuated, in particular with
                    a semicolon after Where gold, presumably in the sense
                    that others touch and, often touching, will touch where there is gold to
                        touch . . . .
                    READ:that the gold bides
                            still
                        That others touch, yet often touching will
                        Wear gold, and no man that hath a name
                        By falsehood and corruption doth it
                        shame. This gives a clear and continuous sense and thought in
                    natural sequence. Yt, here
                    read yet in line [386] in Folio, is a common form for that. Where for Wear is perhaps less
                    obvious, and for yet inexplicable,
                    unless the yet was attracted by the preceding
                    line.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): The passage contrasts an enamelled surface which wears away
                    in use, with the gold underneath, which still wears gold, i.e.
                    remains [OED, v.1 15]; the implication is a
                    double one, for as jewel refers to herself, Adriana laments that
                    she has lost her beauty (cf. l. [365] above), and goes off (ll. [390–1]) to weep away what’s left of it, while
                    feeling that her true worth remains intact; as jewel refers to
                    Antipholus, Adriana seems to say that although he wears away his outward
                    attractions in the service of other women, his true value as her husband cannot
                    be violated by falsehood or corruption, or, as Baldwin puts it, the
                        enamel of reputation may indeed be tarnished, but the gold of character will
                        not be affected. I assume that shame is a noun, used
                    here in the phrase to do shame, to inflict injury, as at Tw.N., III.iv.[366; 1886],
                        Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame [OED, sb.
                    3a].
            This lengthy explanation still does not do justice to the ambiguity
                    of syntax in ll. [387–9], where often touching will Wear gold could mean
                    that gold does wear away [OED, v.1 9a]; Tilley
                    cites this passage in relation to a phrase, Gold by continual wearing
                        wasteth (I 92). . . .  This contradiction of the obvious sense
                    registers Adriana’s doubt even as she tries to reassure herself about her
                    husband.
                Baldwin
                (1962, pp. 141 ff.; rpt. slightly changed in Genetics, 1965, pp. 171
                ff.): A modern reader needs only suitable punctuation between
                        gold and and ([388]) to set off the two halves of the simile.
                    Failure to recognize this technical structure has been the cause of all our
                    woe. . . . 
            The conjunctive and . . . is certainly correct,
                    joining the two parts of the simile. This . . . in turn clears the conclusion
                    of the simile. Most of the rest of the premise also falls naturally into
                    place. . . .  The difficulty is in the immediately following lines:  . . . and often touching will, Where gold and no man
                        that hath a name, By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
                        &lt;387–9&gt; As the text stands, will must be
                    completed grammatically by the next precedent verb, bides. In
                    that case, often touching becomes the object, and the statement
                    becomes: gold will bide often touching. Then Where gold becomes
                    the condition—if it really is gold. The comma following will is
                    in keeping with this interpretation, whereas if often touching is
                    taken as the subject, and Where is replaced by
                        Wear, then the line should run on, without a comma, as does
                    the preceding line, with which it rhymes. Theobald’s suggested
                        Wear (after Warburton) reverses the grammatical structure
                    which is bolstered by the punctuation.
            Wright &amp;
                        LaMar (ed. 1963): It is possible that
                    the confusion is a deliberate reflection of Adriana’s jealous state of mind. She
                    seems obsessed with the idea that she has lost her beauty and her husband’s
                    regard; at the same time she is bitter about what she considers his misconduct.
                    She equates herself with a mere beautiful ornament, whose value depends on its
                    fresh appearance, while her husband is like a gold coin, which does not
                    depreciate in value despite much handling by many hands.
            Wells (ed.
                1972) on 385–8:
                    The present edition assumes that behind these lines lies the
                    following meaning: Even the best-enamelled golden ornament will tarnish.
                        Yet the gold itself retains its value, even though people other than its
                        owner touch it. Nevertheless, frequent touching will wear
                        gold away; similarly, no man’s reputation can remain untainted if he behaves
                        in a corrupt and false manner. In this metaphor the
                        ornament is her husband, who has lost his beauty in her eyes.
                    She admits that he retains value for others, but suggests that
                    this value, too, is liable to dwindle.
            But this interpretation is in itself faulty, since the
                        jewel could be interpreted as Adriana’s beauty rather than
                    Antipholus’s worth, and in line [387] the word and suggests
                        therefore or moreover rather than
                        nevertheless. It may be that and is
                    erroneous, since it comes again in the following line. The corruption of the
                    passage is such that it is best omitted in performance.
            On 387
                touching: To touch gold is to
                    test its quality by rubbing it on a touchstone, a process which, if continued,
                    would rub it away.
            On 388
                Wear gold: I take this to mean wear away
                        gold. But a possible interpretation is remain gold
                        still. If this were adopted, we should have to interpret often touching will | Wear gold as being often
                        tried, or touched (perhaps with some sexual implications [OED, Touch v.
                            2a]), gold will still remain itself.
            Bevington (ed.
                1988): Adriana seemingly compares her beauty to that of a well-enamelled
                    jewel that tarnishes in time through neglect, whereas some beauty, like gold, is
                    often touched and hence retains its luster through use; this latter kind of
                    beauty is not shamed through falsehood and corruption by men of name or reputation like Antipholus of Ephesus, as Adriana
                    feels she is being shamed.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): &lt;Even&gt; the best-enamelled golden ornament will lose its lustre;
                    yet the gold itself that people other than the owner handle remains all the
                    same; but frequent handling will wear away &lt;even&gt; gold, and there is no
                    man with a reputation that is not soiled by falsehood and
                corruption.
            Taylor (1988,
                pp. 200, 204, 215–17) makes the most detailed analysis, subjecting the passage to
                extensive lexical, syntactic, and metrical examination. Of no man that hath a
                    name, By falsehood and corruption doth it shame: R. A. Foakes and
                    other male commentators have defended this statement, but as it stands the
                    generalization is not only false but wildly uncharacteristic of Adriana.
                    According to Foakes, Adriana is saying that Antipholus’s true value as
                        her husband cannot be violated by falsehood and corruption; this
                    paraphrase is logically and morally obnoxious, and difficult to extract from the
                    words of the text. . . .  In Foakes’s interpretation Adriana’s speech is
                    unimpeachably orthodox, hence wholly uncharacteristic of her and
                unintelligible in the light of Luciana’s rebuke, i.e., Luciana surely doesn’t hear
                the import of Foakes’s paraphrase.
            The first two and a half lines . . . are thus complex, but coherent and
                    intelligible. The jewel/gold is a metaphor for women. The difference between the
                    first proposition and the second, between loose and bides
                        still, depends upon whether the jewel/woman is
                        touched, taken care of, cherished. Antipholus’s neglect of
                    precisely such attention was the theme of Adriana’s preceding speech.
                Taylor’s
                notion of touching as caring for is hard to find
                    OED authority for.
            Adriana’s reasoning could be paraphrased thus: I see that the
                        best enameled ornament (like a woman) will lose its beauty (if
                        neglected)—yet a golden ornament (or a woman) that others touch and cherish
                        will remain beautiful; and gold (like a woman) loses its value if touched
                        too often—but a man, however false and corrupt, never loses his
                        reputation.
            If this interpretation is correct, then in line [387]—in the middle of the middle line of this
                    conceit—Adriana takes up and expands upon one of the terms of her previous
                    metaphor: she revises her own image. What prompts this shift of thought,
                    verbally, is the unintended ambiguity of the phrase others touch,
                    which can suggest (sexual) contact with more than one partner. What prompts this
                    shift, dramatically, is Adriana’s own jealousy, her recurrent complaint that
                    others have touched Antipholus. Women lose their beauty, if neglected; on the
                    other hand, if they are touched too often, they lose their value. But men,
                    however licentious, keep their rank and reputation. Adriana first develops a
                    conceit on brooch-as-woman . . . ; she then, abandoning that conceit, contrasts
                    the predicament of women which it had bodied forth with the unfair invulnerable
                    liberty of men. This passage, this speech, this scene, analyzes the sexual
                    double standard. He changes his to hir, a common compositor’s misreading.
            Errors tend to come in batches. . . .  Compositor C was more prone than his
                    fellow compositors to omission, especially in verse (as here), especially of
                    minor parts of speech (like yet); he elsewhere—as with
                        his for correct hir—reversed
                    the gender of pronouns (LLL
                        537/2.1.60); most of the known substitutions in his work might (like
                        Where for correct Weare) be
                    due to memorial confusion (O’Connor, [1977], 60–61, 69–70). Of course, we would
                    all prefer not to emend the text at all if we could avoid it. But if the logic
                    of the preceding analysis is correct, hir and Weare and yet not only make better
                    sense of the passage than any previous interpretation, but provide the only
                    reconstruction which the logic of the lines and their context will
                    permit. He might have added to the batches the alone, a loue (383) just preceding the passage at hand.
            Greenblatt et
                    al. (ed. 1997): A difficult passage, possibly owing to omitted
                    lines. The general idea is that reputation, like gold, withstands corruption and
                    yet may be worn away. Her husband’s infidelities have not tarnished his name,
                    but they may diminish her substance. This is hard to follow: is her
                    substance the same as her reputation
                    (name), when name is apparently the man’s
                reputation? The chief benefit of Taylor’s version is that it is actable; the actor
                can make the necessary gestures of discovering the sexist implications of
                    touching, whereas other readings seem much too complicated to get
                across to an audience in the few seconds available to speak the lines. The
                possibility that it (389) refers to the Iewell and beauty (as with Bevington above) yields: No decent man who possesses a
                    good reputation will shame something so valuable as a jewel/wife—but that’s what
                    has happened to me. The natural antecedent of it
                is, of course, name, but worse dislocations than that are
                common in Sh. This version is likewise actable, with a sufficient pout and
                self-pointing finger at it.

                    shows. Antipholus is puzzled and is trying to piece the situation

                Foakes (ed.

                    saying that he cannot find Dromio, who has not stayed at the inn (cf. [172]), but has gone to seek him,
                    working out where he might be on the host’s advice (as the punctuation of
                        F suggests); or he may be finding out that he cannot have

                    and if there was a multiple setting . . . then this scene belongs to that
                    unlocalized area of the platform stage which served for street or mart, and

                    does not correspond with E. Dro., i.e. Dromio of
                    Ephesus.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): This might be confusing . . . ; but the context makes clear which
                    Antipholus is intended.
                Confusing only to readers, of course.

                pronounced as disyllables.

        415
            vaine] Schmidt (1875, Vein 2): Disposition, temper
                    (OED, sb.
                    14b, where the emphasis is on a temporary state, unlike the
                more permanent state at 1367). Tetzeli von
                        Rosador (ed. 1982): Literally, vein. The veins
                transport the humors. If they mostly carry the fluids of a sanguine person, blood,
                that person has happy veins and thus is in a good mood, referring to
                J. Schäfer, Wort und Begriff humour in der
                    elizabethanischen Komödie (Münster, 1966), p. 5 (Ger.). Cf. 1367.
        


        417–20
            Yea . . . me] Foakes (ed. 1962, p. 114): Master and servant also
                    quarrel in the play, comparing Eph. 6:5, 9 (see
                    ).
        


        417
            flowt . . . teeth] Foakes (ed. 1962): Insult me to my face; a
                    common expression (cf. Tilley, T 429) [To cast (hit) in the
                    Teeth].
        


        418
            hold] Here! (OED, v. 15b). In the next line, hold your
                    hand! (v. 29).
        


        419
            sir] White (ed. 1857): This use of sir,—a word
                    which is scattered in just this way through the dramatic literature of the
                    golden age of English letters . . . —the Great Britons of to-day sneer at as an
                    Americanism! It occurs here, in a short dialogue, at least twenty times
                (16 times, 21 times in the whole scene).
        


        419
            earnest] Proverbial; see Tilley (J46): Leave Jesting while it pleases
                    lest it turn to earnest.
                Delius (ed.
                1858): Quibble between earnest = seriousness and = earnest
                money paid to bind a bargain (OED, sb.1 2, sb.2 1) (Ger.). Cf. 1106 (no pun there).

            vse . . . foole] Mowat &amp; Werstine (ed.
                1996): Allow you to jest with me as if your job were to entertain me (like a
                    professional Fool or jester).
        


        423–6
            Your . . . beames] Clark (1934, p. 113): Some personal servants,
                    such as the Dromio’s and Launce and Speed, share their masters’ adventures and
                    often receive more kicks than ha’pence for their pains. Although such servants
                    as these are of humble origin and should not be confused with the men and women
                    of good family who attended the high and mighty, we still note a certain
                    familiarity between them and their masters. . . .  Dromio would have been wise
                    to keep his sauciness within bounds, for there was no law to prevent masters
                    striking and beating their servants.
        


        423–4
            Your . . . howres] Delius (ed. 1858): Your sauciness abuses my
                friendliness, and makes even my serious hours dedicated to thought, not allotted to
                amusement, like to a commons, on which everyone can gad about (Ger.). Herford
                (ed. 1899) paraphrases: Treat my hours of business as common property in
                    which every one is free to indulge his humour.
        


        423
            iest vpon] Schmidt (1874, Jest vb. 2): To act or speak in
                    sport (OED, v. 3; vpon was idiomatic earlier in the
                c., being replaced by at). Dyce (ed. 1857), reading jet: An error partly occasioned perhaps by the
                    occurrence of the word jest both in the preceding speech [418] and towards the close of the
                    present one [427], comparing
                    Tit. 2.1.64 (620), R3 2.4.30 (1518). Herford
                (ed. 1899): Dyce’s emendation . . . though perhaps too tragic for the
                    occasion, is very plausible. But the antithesis serious is
                    against it. So Cuningham (ed. 1907), Wilson (ed. 1922), Foakes (ed.
                1962).
        


        424
            make a Common] Steevens (ed. 1793): I.e. intrude on them when you
                    please. The allusion is to those tracts of ground destined to common use, which are thence called commons (OED, Common sb. 5). Becket (1815, 2:303), improbably: This
                    has no allusion to tracts of ground, as the context
                    sufficiently shews. . . .  The reference is to the like usage in colleges and
                    religious houses.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): Having regard to jest in the preceding line,
                    Hanmer’s reading, comedy, is certainly ingenious, though
                    perhaps hardly warranted by the versification of Shakespeare’s early
                    period.
                Comedy is trisyllabic in all four verse occurrences in the
                canon.
        


        425
            When . . . sport] Sarrazin (1897, p. 102) parallels 3H6 2.6.9 (1289), And whither fly
                    the gnats but to the sun?, as part of his collection of wordings common
                to the earliest plays.
        


        427
            know my aspect] Steevens (ed. 1793): I.e. study my countenance,
                marking the stress on the second syllable of aspect. So Singer (ed.
                1826). Douce
                (1807, 1:365): An astrological phrase, ascertain whether my
                        aspect be malignant or benign, citing 1H4 1.1.97 (100); OED (4). Cf. 795, 924–5.

            it? so] See textual note.
                    Werstine (Unrecorded Variant, 1978, pp.
                329–30) finds the uncorrected state in two incomplete copies of F1
                not collated by Hinman (1963, Folger 64, 79): The press correction in
                        [H2vb 11] is also unusual because it is
                    semisubstantive. Few Folio press corrections affect the sense of the text at
                    all. Even in its uncorrected state the passage makes sense [quotes 430]. But the proofreader’s
                    correction in placing the question mark after it is an
                    improvement. While there is no need to assume reference to copy for the
                    correction, the proofreader must have been attending closely to the sense of the
                    passage in order to improve it; he suggests that this uncorrected state
                may remain the sole witness to the several rounds of careful proofreading
                    that produced a clean text of the play.

                    secure (OED, Ensconce v. 2, citing this as the first figurative
                occurrence). Rann (ed. 1786) on sconce . . . and
                    Insconce: A slight fortification, and hide it too (OED, v. 3). Baldwin

            wit . . . shoulders] Eds. have trouble elucidating. Delius (ed.
                1858): Because Dromio’s wit would stick surer in his shoulders or in his back than
                in his head by the blows of Antipholus (Ger.). Cuningham (ed. 1907): Run
                    away; show my back, citing Ant. 3.11.8 (2032). Baldwin (ed. 1928):
                    His head and brain will be beaten down into his shoulders. So
                    Barton
                (in Evans,
                ed. 1974), Bevington (ed. 1988). Foakes (ed. 1962): Because his head
                    [thus] battered will be useless, citing Tilley (W548), He has
                    more Wit in his head than you in both your shoulders; not accepted by
                    Dent
                (1981), but allowed as the first occurrence by ODEP (1970):
                    in both your shoulders.

        434
            why . . . beaten] Wells (ed. 1972): After their altercation,
                    master and servant revert to their usual friendly relationship in a passage of
                    jesting largely based on proverbial expressions.
        


        438–9
            euery why . . . wherefore] Proverbial; see Tilley (W331): There
                    is never a Why but there is a wherefore, citing Gascoigne, Supposes (1566) 1.1: I have given you a wherfore for
                    this why many times (Bullough, 1957, 1:112). OED (Wherefore sb. 6) cites
                this line as the first occurrence of wherefore following why. Abbott (§75): Every deed said to be done
                    owing to a certain cause is really done for a certain object, comparing
                    Ham. 1.4.57 (642).
        


        440–4
            Why first . . . reason] See textual note 440. Capell (1774, p. 72): The attender to what
                    goes before, will have no doubt of the rectitude of this transposition
                        [First why]; by which, and by being put into verse, the
                    humour of the speech is much heighten’d: The limping reply of the man,—running
                    one line in dogrel, the other in a sprawling heptameter,—is truly comick; which
                    is more than can be said, with a safe conscience, of most of the things that
                    come after it, as far down as the entry of Adriana.
        


        440
            flowting] Mowat &amp; Werstine (ed. 1996) point
                to the story of Balaam’s ass (Num. 22:21–3): The
                    ass, seeing an angel barring Balaam’s way, refuses to go forward and is three
                    times severely beaten. God allows the ass to speak, and she asks Balaam,
                        What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me three
                        times? And Balaam said unto her, Because thou hast mocked
                        me. . . .  And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass,
                        upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day?
                    This dialogue also seems echoed in [1310–13].

                1966): At the wrong time, unjustly (OED, Season sb. 16).
        


        443–4
            neither . . . reason] Halliwell (ed. 1854): Absurdus, inconvenient, foolysshe,
                        discordyng, dishoneste, abhorrynge, odiouse, agaynst all rime and
                        reason, [Sir Thomas] Eliotes Dictionarie, ed. 1559 (OED, Rhyme sb.
                    3b). Proverbial; see Tilley (R98). Foakes (ed. 1962): We may
                    be intended to notice that Dromio now speaks in rhymed verse after a few lines
                    of prose; cf. a similar passage in Gent., II.i.132 [517].
        


        446
            Marry] Schmidt (1875): An exclamation supposed to have been
                    derived from the name of the Holy Virgin. . . .  3. To affirm anything
                    (OED, int.

        448–9
            nothing for something] Foakes (ed. 1962): I.e. to pay him nothing
                    for his services.
        


        449–502
            But . . . conclusion] Foakes (ed. 1962): This passage of burlesque
                    dialectics is germane to the action of the play as it relates to the constant
                    mistiming which is a part of the sequence of errors. . . . The
                    argument leads to two main points; one is Antipholus’s learn to jest in
                        good time; there’s a time for all things [458–9], a comment which
                    suggests how intimately proper timing is linked with good order; the other is
                    Dromio’s mock-proof that there is no time for all things [494–5], which
                    comes home to Antipholus when he . . . finds his normal sense of order and time
                    disturbed, and believes himself the victim of witchcraft and illusions.
                    Shakespeare was immediately indebted to Lyly for this kind of vexing
                        dialogue, as L[udwig] Borinski calls it [Shakespeare’s Comic Prose,
                    ShS 8 (1955), 63–5]; see, for example, Midas, II.ii.15 ff [ed. 1902, 3:127–8].
                Vickers
                (1968, pp. 32–3): Repartee is seen at its simplest, in that one character is
                    The Comic and the other The Stooge: so we know that one half of the team is
                    always going to win, as we never do with Falstaff and his opponents, or with
                    Beatrice and Benedick and theirs (a more fundamental difference is that here the
                    wit is the badge of a profession, whereas later it is the expression of
                    personality). Thus Dromio of Syracuse hints: [quotes 460–1], to which the master
                    provides the necessary responses: [quotes 462] and again to the witty description of the rule [465].
        


        450–2
            meat . . . Basting] Foakes (ed. 1962): Dromio says the meat lacks
                    what he has had, quibbling on the special sense of basting = a thrashing
                    (OED, Basting vbl.
                    sb.3, citing this line
                as the first occurrence of the double sense. Moistening roasting meat with melted
                butter or gravy is the other sense). Cf. n. 457.

                    acquiescence, or astonishment and indignation (OED, sb. 46c[d]), citing this line). Foakes (ed. 1962) adds: But
                    Shakespeare must have had in mind the sense At the appropriate
                        time, which [sense] emerges at [458–9] (OED, sb. 42c[a]). Cf. 458.

                    4): In a passion, enraged, angry, citing 461 as the first occurrence. Steevens (ed. 1785) quotes Shr. 4.1.174 (1806). Halliwell (ed.
                1854): Over-roasted or dried up meat was formerly considered to induce
                    choler, one of the many dietetical absurdities of our ancestors, citing

                    one of the four humours or liquids which were thought to circulate in a man’s
                    body and nourish him, was assigned the property of being hot and dry; and since
                    it was believed that the humours were distilled directly out of the food and
                    drink a man consumed, so his temperament or balance of humours depended on his
                    diet. Cf. 461.

                Cuningham quotes LLL 5.2.263
                    (2180) (OED, Dry a. 12, citing this line). Ibid. (p. xxvii) compares Warner’s (1595) translation:
                    Methinks it is no pleasure to a man to be basted with a
                        ropes end two or three houres togither (see ). Wilson (ed. 1922, Glossary, Dry): In this sense [severe
                    beating] dry = mighty and is etymologically distinct from
                        dry as opposed to moist, citing G. C. Macaulay,
                    Dry Basting,
                MLR, 10 (1915), 224–5, who is amplifying from Middle
                English examples of an etymological distinction OED does
                not make: (a. 12: By some app.
                    used vaguely, = Hard, stiff, severe). Foakes (ed. 1962): The
                    usual sense of basting, i.e. moistening, is ironically brought into
                    play, citing Rom.

                    Attention must be wearied with so long a continuation of snip-snap
                    word-catching. In Hull’s version of 1770, which, with other

            bald . . . time] Jusserand (1909, 3:275), ponderously: Such
                    perfect baldness cannot be achieved in a day, and Shakespeare’s probably
                    commenced early; his facetious praise of that little infirmity . . . is just
                    what one might expect from a writer with a brow prematurely denuded.
                Baldwin
                (1927, pp. 261–4) elaborates on Sh. the actor’s lines, i.e., his
                characteristic roles. Idem (ed. 1928): If Jusserand’s suggestion is
                    correct . . . this would be a further qualification for his known rôles as an
                    actor, those of old men.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): As commonly personified, Time was bald except for a forelock,
                citing Jn. 3.1.324 (1257) and
                    Tilley
                (T311): Take Time (occasion) by the forelock, for she is bald behind.

            fine and recouerie] Bevington (ed. 1988): A legal procedure for
                    converting an entailed estate, one in which the property is limited to specified
                    heirs, into a fee simple, one in which the owner has unqualified
                    ownership.
                OED (Fine sb.1 6b; Recovery II. 4. Law.
                    a): The fact or procedure of gaining possession of some property or
                    right by a verdict or judgement of court; spec. the
                    process, based on a legal fiction, by which an entailed estate was commonly
                    transferred from one party to another. Bevington’s is the clearest
                definition; other, more elaborate ones appear in Halliwell (ed. 1854), Cuningham
                (ed. 1907), Underhill (1916, 1:404–6), and Foakes (ed. 1962), Cuningham and
                Foakes referring to Ham. 5.1.99
                    (3297). Some commentators think the phrase, with others, points to formal
                legal training. Steevens (ed. 1793): This attempt at pleasantry must
                    have originated from our author’s clerkship to an attorney. So White (ed.
                1857), Campbell (1859, p. 45), Cuningham (pp. xli–xlv, listing 26 items
                of legal language). Underhill (1:381): It is unnecessary to explain such
                    [legal] knowledge as he had by assuming that he enjoyed even a legal education
                    as a clerk in a lawyer’s office. . . .  It seems probable . . . that both
                    dramatists and actors were much in legal society, and picked up the technical
                    and legal slang of the day.
                Schmidt
                (1874, Fine subst. 3): Perhaps . . . = by finery and re-covery, i.e. by
                    making himself fine and re-covering his head with another man’s hair.
                Kökeritz
                (1953, p. 107) suggests a homonymic pun on foin, polecat hair used
                for trimming gowns. Cercignani (1981, p. 247): It is not possible to accept fine-foin as [an] actually intended pun.
                Foakes and Tetzeli
                        von Rosador (ed. 1982) say that Wilson (ed. 1922) suggests a
                quibble on hair (470) and heir, but the only place that quibble is
                mentioned (p. x) refers to 915. Parker (1996,
                p. 26): A legal means of curbing the power of elder sons (OED II.4, citation from 1861):
                    Those famous Fines and Recoveries which did so much to undo the harshest
                    trammels of feudal land-law.

            to pay . . . perewig] Booth (1997, p. 14) hears a dormant
                pun on toupee, admitting that OED has no
                citation before 1731, but the French word toupet, a tuft of hair, goes way
                    back.
        


        469–70
            perewig . . . lost haire] Foakes (ed. 1962): [Human] hair was bought
                    and sold to make wigs, citing MV 3.2.88 ff. (1475–83).
        


        472
            plentifull an excrement] I.e., plentiful in the world at large, though
                scant for some men. Theobald (ed. 1733, 7:315 [Ham.]):
                    That our Poet was acquainted with this notion in Physics, of the Hair
                    being without life, we need no stronger Warrant, than that he frequently
                    mentions it as an Excrement (OED, sb.2: That which grows out or
                forth).
        


        474
            scanted] Schmidt (1874, Scant vb. 2): To afford sparingly and
                    with reluctance, to grudge (OED,
                        v. 5, citing this line).

            them] See textual note.
                    Theobald
                (1726, p. 173): Sure, this is an evident Paradox, and Contradiction in Sense.
                    Can Hair be supposed a Blessing that Time bestows on Beasts peculiarly, and yet he hath scanted them of it too? Correct, as the Context plainly requires [to
                        men].
                Malone (ed.
                1790) notes the same error in F
                2H4, Induction 8, where, as Foakes (ed. 1962) observes,
                    Q reads men (F
                Compositor B setting from printed copy). Collier (ed. 1842), Wilson (ed. 1922), Foakes, Dorsch (ed.
                1988) repeat Theobald and/or Malone. O’Connor (1977, pp. 61–2) describes Compositor C’s
                tendency to make errors based on faulty memory or eyeskip; either might account for
                    them. Werstine MS adds: Perhaps he substituted them for men in order to justify
                    the line in which he had already inserted spaces before two commas.
                Knowles
                (privately): No difficulty at all. The actor simply says them, gesturing to someone in the audience.
        


        476–7
            more . . . wit] Proverbial; see Tilley (B736): Bush natural, more hair
                    than wit.
        


        478–9
            lose . . . haire] A reference to an effect of syphilis. Johnson (ed.
                1765): Those who have more hair than wit, are easily
                    entrapped by loose women [? Samson and Delilah], and suffer the consequences of
                    lewdness, one of which, in the first appearance of the disease in Europe, was the loss of hair.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) compares Tim. 4.3.160
                    (1776) and MND 1.2.100
                    (358–9): The hint of bawdy here may explain jollity, l. [483].
        


        480
            didst] I.e., wouldst, in that case you would conclude.
        


        480–1
            plain dealers] Schmidt (1874, Plain-dealing): Open, honest;
                    Plain-dealers, Simpletons (OED,
                        a., no attestation for Simpletons). Baldwin (ed. 1928): Antipholus says that
                    according to Dromio’s reasoning hairy men are without wit, thus must be plain in
                    their dealings.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): You said that hairy men lacked wit, and so were plain
                        dealers—straightforward. Dromio [482] takes plain dealing to refer
                    specifically to their behaviour towards women—the more straightforward they were
                    in their approaches, the sooner they were in trouble.
                Knowles
                (privately): Perhaps plain dealers means honest to
                    their wives, so that they don’t catch syphilis from a whore. Dromio puns, giving
                    the phrase an opposite sense: innocently careless.
        


        482
            plainer . . . lost] Foakes (ed. 1962): The old sense of
                        deal, to divide or share out, may be implied here. There
                    seems also to be an allusion to the proverb, The properer (honester) man
                        the worse luck (Tilley, M 360). It is possible that the bawdy
                    suggestion of l. [478–9] is carried over, if dealer means dealer
                        with women, cf. Per. IV.vi.[25–6] . . . and O.E.D., deal, v 11b. Neither Tilley nor
                    Dent
                (1981) lists Err. as using the proverb. Tetzeli von
                        Rosador (ed. 1982): Cf. Rom. 2.4.168–70 (1264–6), where deal has a sexual sense; since plain can mean
                    simple-minded as well as direct, Dromio could mean
                either The more simple-minded and gullible a man is with whores, the easier
                    he is caught in their traps and lost or The more direct a man is
                    with whores, the more easily he’ll catch syphilis and lose his hair.
        


        483
            iollitie] Sisson (1956, 1:91): A visit to a brothel was a kind of jollity, and its results were frequently
                    venereal disease and loss of hair.

                    testicles.
                Reason (pronounced raisin) and sound, free from syphilis, continue the bawdiness. Turner
                (privately): The testicles lose in jollity, becoming thereby temporarily
                    unsound. They are guilty of falsing (488) because they play fast and loose.
        


        485–6
            sound . . . sound] Delius (ed. 1858): Dromio takes sound = that will stand the test with regard to reason; Antipholus takes it to = healthy, with regard to the
                aforementioned way men lose their hair (OED,
                        a. 8, 1a) (Ger.). Foakes (ed. 1962) notes the bawdy
                suggestion in 478–9, 482, 483, and here.

                Singer (ed.
                1856): The allusion is to falling hairs; one of
                    Dromio’s reasons is, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge [493]. Modern eds.’
                    deceptive, derived from Onions (1911), is not certain. Greenblatt et

                    Capell
                (1774, Glossary, Tyre or Tire): To dress or attire (OED, Tire v.3 2b, 2c: To dress [the hair or
                    head]). Collier (1853, pp. 78–9): Pope . . . was certainly
                    mistaken. . . .  Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse are talking of
                    hair . . . and the word trimming was quite technical in
                    reference to cutting and dressing the hair. . . .  It is clear that the letter

                    trimming, being the word intended—to save the money that he spends in trimming, not in tiring or
                    attiring, which has relation not to the hair merely, but to the whole apparel,
                    whereas the hair only was under discussion. But see OED 2c above. Halliwell (ed. 1854) thinks trỹing
                = trimming, the tilde being omitted. White (ed. 1857): The loss of a man’s hair

                        [F], the letter (t) in there had
                    dropped out: in one of my copies it is almost visible; accordingly it was

                Wilson (ed.

                    is in some copies apparently missing. The F. comma
                        before there sticks up and prevents the d of proved and the t of
                            there marking properly (W. W. Greg:

                probably right; font size should not affect the inking or printing of adjacent

                    upbraids him. . . .  [Amphitruo] III.ii.9[0]3–30.
                    Alcmena upbraids Jupiter, her supposed husband, for her husband’s accusations of
                    her. See  for varying
                views on how to take this speech, sympathetically or with amusement either because
                she is a shrew or because all the passion is directed at the wrong man. Charlton
                (1931; 1938, p. 68), perhaps with a sneer, speaks of her single lapse into
                    the broken-hearted bride. But the marriage, an arranged one, seems to
                have been Antipholus’s reward for military service done for the Duke long
                    since (1667). Muir (1972,
                p. 47): We are never directly told whether Adriana’s jealousy has any real
                    cause. Luciana, when she pleads with Antipholus, seems to assume that he is to
                    blame, but expresses it as an hypothesis [quotes 793]. But his wild behavior, as far as we see
                    it . . . , is to have dinner, duly chaperoned, with [the
                    Courtesan] . . . excusably after he has been shut out of his own house.
                Hibbard
                (1981, p. 91): Any speech that smacks of the passionate or
                        poetical is suspect. . . .  There is no mistaking the sense
                    of pain and the tone of reproach [in 525–33]. At the same time, however, there is,
                    even in these nine lines, more than a touch of excess and extravagance. . . . 
                    If it could be taken straight, the speech would at least verge on the absurd.
                    [But, he says, it cannot be taken straight because she is not addressing her
                    real husband.] Few things are more ludicrous than the misdirected moral
                    diatribe.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): This passage, with its lyrical references to the delights of early
                    love, is the most eloquent account in the play of the marriage bond. . . .  At
                    the same time there is the absurd circumstance that Adriana is talking to the
                    twin image of her other half.
                Singh (1988,
                p. 45): Her pleading contains the sharpest attack on the double standard in
                    Shakespeare. How long she has been married is likewise uncertain. Foakes (ed.
                1962, p. 114) compares Eph. 5:22–8, 33.

                Sarrazin
                (1897, p. 112) notes the parallel use of the five senses in Ven. 433–44. Baldwin (1947, p. 607 n.)
                compares LLL 4.3.331–46
                    (1794–1809). Marsh (1972, p. 112) expands Malone: The Epistle of
                    Sappho to Phaon [Ovid, Heroides 15.41–50],
                    significantly based on the not beautiful poetess’ abandonment by the beautiful
                    young man who had been her lover . . . : Yet, when I read you my songs,
                        I seem already beautiful enough; you swore ’twas I alone whom speech forever

                        way. . . . Shakespeare modestly changes the eroticism of this into
                    a parallel list of sensual experiences, which likely hinted amorous
                    meanings.

                    must be alienated from himself in behaving coldly towards her, for she is so
                    indissolubly knit to him that she is more essential to him than his soul. The
                    phrase better part [518] could refer both to the soul or most intimate part of a man, and
                    to his best qualities, and both senses are often brought into play in contexts
                    relating to love; cf. Sonn. xxxix.2.

                    The point is that when she is united with him, that joint self is better even

                    Part is emphatic, to make the antithesis between part and undivided whole. I take better to be a compliment: even though your part of the union is

                    himself, but also to find himself and his family), so Adriana does not realize
                    that her claim upon her husband is too possessive, see n. [1567–70]. This passage also
                    connects directly, through the repetition of the idea of l. [518], with Antipholus’s wooing of Luciana in [826–53], which
                    echoes in the terms of its appeal Adriana’s plea here to him. But
                    too possessive is hindsight, and her authorities in 507–18 are
                impeccable. Foakes may have been influenced by Brown (1957, pp. 54–5); see
                n. 567–74.

            How . . . vndishonoured] Baldwin (ed. 1928): Adriana points out
                    to Antipholus that they two are undividably one, and that he would punish any
                    erring on her part. But if so, he ought now to punish her, because he has
                    sinned, and thus in their undividable oneness has made her guilty without any
                    act of her own. She again advises him therefore to keep fair league and truce
                    with his bed by punishing or distaining her. So will he clear his own honor.
                    Failing to follow out this ironic application, many editors have proposed to
                    emend distained [541].
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) on Baldwin: This is overingenious, strains the meaning of distain, and again disregards the stress of Adriana’s
                    pleading on the indivisibility of husband and wife—his honour is her honour,
                    too.
                Baldwin
                (1962, pp. 144–6) thinks that Sh. is indebted to phrases from the second part of the
                homily on matrimony and the second part of the sermon against adultery, but the
                parallels are too commonplace to be convincing.

                    her not to call him by the false name of husband. Adriana means that
                Antipholus would angrily remind her of the bond between husband and wife that he
                would divorce her by hurling back at her (thus rejecting) the name of husband that
                he took when he married her.
        


        531
            stain’d . . . brow] Staunton (ed. 1857) believes that the
                    practice of branding criminals on the forehead was extended, in the case of
                    women, to notorious offenders against chastity.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): The forehead proverbially stood for the face or character as
                    signalling shame or guilt, citing Tilley (F590) and 1H4 1.1.85 (88). Tilley:
                    In the Forehead and in the eye the lecture of the heart (mind) doth
                    lie (not in Dent, 1981). Branding the hand is well attested to, but not
                the brow (Henning, 2000, pp. 86–9).

                deep vow and Son. 152.9
                deep oaths. But Sh. is already using compound participles,
                cf. 68. Porter &amp; Clarke (ed. 1903): Shakespeare frequently uses
                    adjectives compounded with deep, comparing LLL 1.1.85 (90).

            crime] Warburton (ed. 1747): Both the integrity of the
                    metaphor, and the word blot, in [535], shew that we should read, with the GRIME of
                    lust: i.e. the stain, smut, citing
                    895. Capell (1774, p. 73):
                    They who have delicacy, will notwithstanding prefer [crime] to—grime, the plausible and slight
                    alteration that is made by [Warburton].
                Staunton (ed.
                1857) quotes Joseph Hall, Virgidemiarum [Satires] (1597), bk. 4, satire 1, l. 154, Besmeared all with the
                    loathsome smoake of lust.
                Irving &amp; Marshall (ed. 1888): Grime would seem more appropriate, were Adriana talking of an external
                    stain, not of a defilement of her blood.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): But, judging from [539–40], she is undoubtedly referring to an
                    external physical blot or poison. . . . Besides,
                    can lust, strictly speaking, be called a crime? At least,
                    Shakespeare never refers to it as such.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): The context makes [grime] almost certain. But
                        grime lacks palaeographical support.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Sin, offence. . . .  Adriana’s horror at the thought of being
                    involved in adultery is strikingly reflected in the less obvious word of
                        F.
                Baldwin
                (1962, p. 144): His crime of lust introduces a
                        poison [538] to
                    his flesh . . . ; and this in turn causes a
                        contamination, a mingling, a
                        contagion in her bloud. Baldwin,
                reading crime, quotes for support from the homilies against
                adultery and on matrimony on the dire consequences of lust.

            distain’d . . . vndishonoured] Theobald (letter to Warburton 29 Nov. 1729,
                in Nichols,
                1817, 2:293): Surely, this cannot be our Poet’s meaning; if they both of them
                    were true to wedlock, why should she be stained, and yet
                    he undishonoured? It must either be, I live unstained; or else, with a disjunction, dis-stained.
                Theobald
                (ed. 1733): To stain, defile,
                        pollute [OED,
                            v. 2]. But the Context requires a Sense
                    quite opposite [continuing substantially as above]. Eds. argue whether
                there is any way to save the F reading, most adopting unstained. Dyce (ed. 1864) believes that the compositor (C)
                mistook the original v for d,
                    the proneness of printers to blunder in words beginning with v [being] very common, citing MM 2.1.39 (493), Dr.
                    Faustus (Q 1604 daunt, later Qq
                    vaunt) plus several more from the so-called Beaumont and Fletcher
                plays. Cuningham (ed. 1907) finds distain in R3 5.3.322 (3791) and in Tro. 1.3.241 (701) but notes
                that the participle does not occur in the plays, whereas unstained is common. Foakes (ed. 1962): Dis-tain’d (unstained) . . . would be tempting if it could be
                    differentiated from distain’d (= stained), but I do not
                    see how an actor could put across a coinage identical in sound but opposite in
                    meaning to a common word; in any case the parallelism of the line seems to
                    require a word beginning with un.
                Knowles
                (privately): All that’s needed is that dis- be
                    emphatic, and any actor can do that.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): It is just possible that distained, meaning
                        dishonoured, is correct, and that Adriana is saying that by
                    committing adultery her husband makes a whore of his wife while keeping his own
                        honour unsullied.
                Werstine
                MS finds the primary definition of distain in Palsgrave
                (1530) to be change the colour of a thing: Thus
                        distaine could mean to remove stain, one way
                    of changing the color of a thing, citing (OED, v. 3) as in 1 Tamburlaine 3.2.64–5: Thence rise the tears that so
                    distain my cheeks, Fearing his love through my unworthynesse [ed. 1973,
                    1:110], where Zenocrate means that she is pale with fear. Compositor C,
                though he makes more mistakes than either B or D, does not have so many
                    orthographical errors or misreadings as Compositor D; instead he more often
                    forgets the exact wording or spelling (O’Connor, 1977, p. 61). OED, v. 3
                includes to outshine as a meaning, adding Hence diśtained ppl.
                    a., marking the stress on the first syllable.
                Since OED cites this line as the first occurrence of vndishonored, Sh. may have been straining a bit to emphasize
                Adriana’s passion.

            Be . . . contempt] Most eds. follow Johnson (ed. 1765): If I
                    am doomed to suffer the wrong of separation, yet injure not with contempt me who
                    am already injured, where exempt means cut
                    off from (OED, ppl.
                    a., sb. 1c). Others follow
                    Mason
                (1785, p. 46): Adriana . . . means to say, that as he was her husband she
                    had no power over him, and that he was privileged to do her wrong, where
                    exempt means privileged (OED, a. 3). Baldwin
                (ed. 1928): Adriana, following up the idea of her previous long speech, says
                    she will assume the wrong [her responsibility, not his, for their alienation],
                    and will not accuse Antipholus of it, but she asks that he do not make the wrong
                    [pain of alienation] greater by treating her with the wrong of contempt. These
                    speeches are of prime importance in the delineation of Adriana’s character. She
                    is not a mere shrew, seeking a quarrel with her husband. Though she has reason
                    to suspect him, she will take all blame, if he will only be true.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): If I must suffer the injustice of your alienation from me, do
                        not make the wrong harder to bear by inflicting it with a contemptuous
                        disregard for my feelings. . . .  Note the commencement of rhymed
                    couplets here, marking Adriana’s abandonment of anger, Antipholus’s transition
                    from hostility to acceptance of a fantastic situation.

            Come . . . confusion] Clemen (1936, p. 248) cites the passage as an
                example of early, inorganic imagery in Sh., noticing especially the
                    overflowing heaping up of
                572 (Ger.). Brown (1957, p. 54,
                emphasizing possesse): Err. is
                    an intrigue comedy which aims at making a certain number of characters
                    look ridiculous; it deals . . . with the follies and evils of possessiveness.
                    Adriana’s idea of love is to try to maintain a hold over her husband. . . . 
                    Even at her most submissive, when she cajoles her husband’s twin . . . to come
                    home as her husband, she harps upon rights and possessions.
        


        567
            sleeue] Foakes (ed. 1962) notes the anachronism: Was
                    Shakespeare thinking of the doublet of his own time?
        


        568
            Thou . . . Vine] Rushton (1868, 2:40) notes the syllepsis, quoting
                    Puttenham (1589; Willcock &amp; Walker, ed. 1936, p. 165):
                        Sillepsis, or the Double supply. . . .  Where
                    ye see a third person [verb] supplie [govern] himselfe and a first

        568
            Elme . . . Vine] Noble (1935, p. 107) quotes Ps.
                    128:3: Thy wife shall be as the fruitful vine: upon the walls of
                    thine house. Proverbial; see Tilley (V61): The Vine embraces the
                    elm. Commentators quote Latin examples. Malone (in Steevens, ed.
                1778): Catullus 57 [= 61.102–5]; Reed (ed. 1803), Ovid, Metamorphoses 14.661–6; Chedworth (1805, p. 47),
                Horace, Epode 2.9–10. Baldwin (1944, 1:737),
                tracing Sh.’s grammar school training in Latin, finds it a commonplace: So
                    the elm and vine, which had been entwined in classic times, continue intertwined
                    in Shakspere as everywhere else.
                Demetz
                (1958) covers the elm-ivy topos from Catullus to the end of the 19th c.: Side
                    by side with the parallel of amorous vine and ivy, however, there appears the
                    antithetical combination of the motifs. In this antithesis elm and ivy as signs
                    of marital bliss and fertility (suggested by Catullus’ Carmen LXII) are contrasted with the sexual relationship of the ivy
                    clinging to its tree (as in Carmen LXI). In [Err.] . . . Adriana . . . tries to persuade him to
                    return home by contrasting marital fidelity with the dangerous
                        ivy of marital betrayal: [quotes 567–74]. In this admonition
                    the rightful union of husband and wife is suggested by the essential
                    communication of the weak vine and strong elm, which need each other to bear
                    fruit; the usurping ivy, however, implies that disloyalty which
                    seeks the selfish and sterile (idle) pleasures of sex. The ivy,
                    like a vampire, lives on the tree and, unchecked by social
                    decorum (pruning), drains away his life and infects his sap with
                    carnal passion, if not with foul disease.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Shakespeare may have had Ovid in mind, as Steevens thought,
                quoting Arthur Golding (tr. Metamorphoses, 1567, p. 183):
                    If that the vyne which ronnes uppon the Elme had nat The tree too leane
                    untoo, it should uppon the ground ly flat. He notes the image in Lyly,

                Lüthi (1957,

                certain in human affairs: uncertainty (Ger.) His compatriot Weber (1963, p. 37),
                collecting oxymorons, cannot go along with him, though she agrees that the
                contradiction is not spoken as mere wordplay but as a formulation of the reality of
                the moment, which S. Antipholus smilingly accepts. She says that this is the only

                    deceit. Perhaps, however, [free’d] is right, the free’d
                    fallacy, or the free fallacy, being the permitted or allowed fallacy, using a
                    common meaning of free, and free’d
                    being an ordinary construction before a substantive.
                White (ed.

                        uncertainty in [580],
                    show that there was an easily made misprint of free’d for

                citation does not come until 1665. Considering how often Sh. uses the language of
                formal logic, it is well to have 3a in mind: A deceptive or misleading
                    argument, a sophism. In Logic, esp. a flaw, material or
                    formal, which vitiates a syllogism. Sh. uses fallacy only here.

                (ed. 1864): Dromio wishes for his rosary, to tell his beads, or say his
                    prayers by, while he makes the sign of the cross against evil
                spirits.

                    accepted as one of the many imperfect retarding verses following a pentameter or
                    hexameter.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): The short line may be deliberately expressive of Dromio’s
                    consternation.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): Need we be worried by a line which is metrically short? It is
                    effective.
        


        585
            Owles] Theobald (letter to Warburton, 27 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:293): They might fancy they talked with goblins, and sprights, but
                    why with owls, in the name of Nonsense? I make no doubt
                    but we must read, with goblins, ouphes, and elvish
                    sprights.
                Theobald
                (ed. 1733): Could Owls suck their Breath, and pinch
                    them black and blue? citing ouphes in Wiv. 4.4.50 (2172), 5.5.57 (2539). Others agree that fairies, not birds,
                are needed. Cuningham (ed. 1907), since ouphes
                appears only in Wiv., but elves in
                    MND, Wiv., and Tmp.: I think the balance of probability inclines in
                    favour of the reading elves. . . . It is difficult to see any
                    connection between fairy land (which expression is really
                    the governing factor of the passage) and owls. The latter were
                    repellent to the fairies [quoting MND 2.2.5–6 (655–6)]. . . .  We talk must
                    imply a conversation with fairies, i.e. beings of human
                    shape.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922) finds ouphes . . . very attractive, since
                        oufes and oules might be confused in the
                    MS. . . .  Yet Dromio is surely thinking of spirits in human form.
                Wilson’s suggested similarity between oufes and oules is unlikely because f in
                secretary hand has a descender. Foakes (ed. 1962): [Since] owls are
                    incongruous in this passage, I have adopted elves
                        (F2), as being a more natural word in the context, a common
                    Shakespearian word, and also a form from which the reading of F
                    might easily derive. I assume the compositor saw olues in
                    MS., an initial e looking like o
                    (cf. [n. 581]), and made sense
                    of it by transposing letters. A Compositor D setting.
            Others defend Owles. Warburton (ed. 1747): Theobald
                    did not know it to be an old popular superstition, that the scretch-owl sucked
                    out the breath and blood of infants in the cradle, citing Ovid, Fasti 6.131–9, esp. 137–9: They are said to rend the
                    flesh of sucklings with their beaks, and their throats are full of the blood
                    which they have drunk. Screech-owl is their name (tr. Frazer, 1931, p.
                329). Werstine MS notes that Sh. used the Fasti
                as a source for Luc.
                Halliwell (ed.
                1854) quotes two dictionaries, Baret [1573]: A shrich owle, a witch that
                    chaungeth the favor of children, an hagge or fairie, and Thomas Thomas,
                    Dictionarium linguae Latinae et Anglicanae (1596),
                which paraphrases Ovid. Dorsch (ed. 1988): [Foakes] is not convincing in
                    justifying his emendation elves on the grounds that the
                        compositor saw olwes [sic] in the
                    MS. . . . Theobald’s ouphs . . . could also be misread
                    as owls. I do not see how, since p and h have descenders in secretary
                hand. Ouphes does not occur in print until F
                Wiv.
                Wells &amp;
                        Taylor (ed. 1986) read oafs, attributing it to Theobald, who reads ouphes.
                The spelling oaf is first cited by OED for 1625: Oaf1 . . . &lt;A
                    phonetic variant of AUF . . . see also OUPH.&gt; An elf’s child, a goblin
                    child, a supposed changeling left by the elves or fairies.

            Sprights] I.e., spirits (OED, sb.1 1). See textual note for emendations
                suggesting elvish
                Sprights. Steevens (ed. 1778): The epithet elvish is not in the first folio,
                    but is found in the second.
                Malone (ed.
                1790): All the emendations made in the second folio having been merely
                    arbitrary, any other suitable epithet of two syllables may have been the poet’s
                    word. Mr. Rowe first introduced—elvish.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1793) corrects his mistake of attributing elvish to
                    F2, adding but the second has elves, which certainly was meant for elvish. . . .  I am satisfied with the epithet—elvish. . . .  Why should a book [F2] which has
                    often judiciously filled such vacuities, and rectified such errors, as disgrace
                    the folio 1623, be so perpetually distrusted?
                Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821): This is certainly no proper place for discussing that adulterate
                    copy of our author’s plays. I have elsewhere shewn that the person who revised
                    it was equally unacquainted with Shakspeare’s language and metre. . . .  To
                    talk of his having authority for his innovations (I suppose we are to understand
                    manuscript authority) is very idle. I have proved that he never looked into the
                    printed quarto copies. Can it then be imagined that he would take the trouble of
                    searching for manuscripts? and if he were so inclined, where would he find
                    them?

                Foakes (ed.
                1962): In view of other reminiscences of Lyly in the play, it is possible
                    that Shakespeare had Endimion, IV.iii.28–36, in mind
                    [29, Pinch him, pinch him, black and blue, ed. 1902,

            Dromio, thou snaile] Theobald (ed. 1733): The
                    Verse is thus half a Foot too long; my correction cures that Fault: besides Drone corresponds with the other Appellations of
                    Reproach.
                Armstrong
                (1946, p. 34) reads drone without commenting that it is an
                emendation. He lays out an image cluster of the drone and the weasel
                that presents a repetition of terms beginning in 2H6 4.1.109 (2277) and Luc. 307, 836,
                and continuing through Per. This cluster gives independent
                authority to the emendation. Foakes (ed. 1962): Theobald’s emendation has
                    been generally accepted on metrical grounds; it is also reasonable
                    palaeographically, and makes good sense. But F may be correct
                    if Luciana calls and is ignored: Dromio—thou Dromio &lt;Dromio becoming
                        for the moment a generic term for a lazy servant&gt;—thou snail,
                    etc. (cf. Thou drunkard, thou, [628] and also [1344]).
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Luciana may be using the name as a term of contempt, perhaps with an
                    ironical glance at its literal meaning of runner, (i.e.,
                Dromo = runner in Greek). Barton (in Evans, ed. 1974) gives no explanation for drumble, defined as sluggish person, drone;
                used as a verb in Wiv. 3.3.147
                    (1480). Knowles (privately): Thou is

        594
            Ape] Foakes (ed. 1962): Two meanings of ape are brought into play. Dromio intends to say, I am a
                        counterfeit, imitating my real self (cf. Cym., II.ii.31 [938]), but Luciana seems
                    to catch up another sense, of dupe or fool (as at Rom., II.i.16
                    [766] (OED, sb. 2b, 4). Tetzeli von Rosador (ed.
                1982): Dromio perhaps means that, in a figurative sense, he is an image, shape, or
                copy of himself; these meanings are derived from the medieval and Elizabethan notion
                of the Devil as simia Dei, as ape, as
                a grotesque copy of God (Ger.); he refers to Marlowe, Dr.
                    Faustus 3.3.41 (ed. 1973, 2:198), where Mephistopholis transforms the
                servant Dick into an ape.

                    playing on the literal [OED, Ride v. B1] and figurative [OED 17b, harass] senses of the
                    words . . . ; going to grass (= pasture) was a phrase used metaphorically of a
                    release from responsibilities (O.E.D., sb.1 5b). N[ew] C[ambridge] S[h.] [Wilson,
                    ed. 1922, Glossary, Grass] compares Nashe, Have with you to

                16th c., the shopkeepers’ living quarters were often located over the shop (Brown, 1986,

            Dromio . . . pate] Wells (ed. 1972): The
                    insistent instructions to Dromio to guard the gate prepare the audience for the
                    situation in the following scene, which otherwise might be difficult to
                    understand.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): Is there a hint of hell-gate, with Dromio as devil-porter?
                This seems unlikely. Commentators and productions that believe intercourse takes
                place forget that (607) Luciana
                accompanies the two and that Antipholus falls in love with her, e.g., Tetzeli von
                        Rosador (ed. 1982): Adriana’s repeated commands [602, 614] conjure up the image of a bawd on guard. . . . 
                Adriana looks forward to an amorous tête-á-tête (Ger.). Williams (2000, p. 6) gives
                all the reasons against a sexual reading or performance: An actor who comes,
                    as it were, straight from the bed of Adriana . . . can scarcely be expected to
                    be convincing in the wooing of Luciana. . . .  Shakespeare’s romantic heroes
                    are often inconstant, but they are never two-timing. In lines 1684–5 Adriana says
                Luciana was present at the meal, a statement that should not be disregarded. S.
                Antipholus says he owes no homage to Adriana’s bed (830), and there is every reason to suppose
                    that . . . he is simply telling the truth, unfashionable though such an
                    attitude may be. The metaphors drawn from food as sexual activity and of
                entering a door as penetration are denied because Luciana is S. Antipholus’s food
                    (852), and breaking down the door is
                not applicable to him, but to his brother. It is a commonplace in
                    Shakespeare’s plays that the actions of the servant replicate the actions of
                    their masters, so Dromio’s abhorrence of Luce (945) matches S. Antipholus’s 563–4, a parallel [that]
                    should be allowed to have some significance, and finally the planned
                banquet is the perfect feast, the opposite of which—the imperfect feast,
                    Adriana’s dinner—occupies the center of the play. See n. 651–745.

                    scene ends at the foot of the second column on a crowded page (H3r); the compositor [D] simply dropped the
                    stage-direction in order to squeeze in the catchword Actus, and began H3v with the heading for
                    Act III. Actually Compositor D set H3va
                before he set H3b (Compositor C set H3a). There must have been a casting-off problem, since
                column b (Compositor D) has two speeches in a single line (550).

            Scena Prima] Foakes (ed. 1962): Here
                    Antipholus of Ephesus appears for the first time, giving a new interest and
                    impetus to the action; whereas in Menaechmi, the
                    corresponding twin only begins to get into difficulty with his wife in IV.ii,
                    here Antipholus finds himself in trouble right away. He invites Balthasar to a
                    feast to which they fail to achieve admittance, and this brings the first major
                    discord of the action, in the slanging-match between those inside and those
                    outside the gate (l. [652] ff.); cf.
                        [1895], where the restoration of
                    harmony is marked by a general feast. The scene moves from blank verse, the
                    normal medium of serious action, into a stylized, rhymed discussion on whether
                    hearty food is more important than good food, thence into the tumbling verse,
                    which keeps the quarrel at the door within the bounds of farce, and finally
                    returns to blank verse, and a more serious note, emphasizing the real anger of
                    Antipholus, even though he is persuaded at last to speak of the business as a
                        jest l. [784].

                    One of the various mechanical indications of the act
                structure.

                Tillyard
                (1965, p. 55): Antipholus has indeed been laying up trouble for himself, for
                    not only is he shockingly late for dinner but he is bringing with him two
                    guests, probably unnotified and certainly offensive to the housewife as eating a
                    dinner that through over-cooking does an injustice to her domestic
                    competence.

                examples are Italian names. Foakes (ed. 1962): The name Angelo seems to
                    have made Shakespeare think of Italy, and use an Italian form of address, cf.
                        [1019]. Other early comedies,
                        Gent. and Shr., are set in
                    Italy. Cf. 638, 641, 1019, 1477,

                    interpolation.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): [Perhaps] Shakespeare originally wrote either Good
                        Signior or Good Angelo; and that in correcting to the
                    full address of title and name, Good Signior Angelo, he forgot to
                    strike out all. Other combinations of
                compositional second thoughts and ignored cancellations are possible. The line can
                be scanned by eliding -gelo = Anj-lo and excuse = ’scuse.

                met his brother.

                    to bad timing, cf. [n. 208–32];
                    if Adriana is overpossessive . . . , Antipholus is also to blame for his
                    treatment of her; but this time he finds he has come too late (l.
                        [683]).

            Say . . . together] Commentators note the mixture of rhymed verses, but
                vary in their count of feet or stressed syllables. Capell (1774, pp. 73–4):
                    This strange scene runs in measures of all sorts: four, five, six-foot
                    verses; pure, mix’d, regular, and irregular; anapests some, and some iambicks:
                    from the jumble of which together, results a new kind of pleasantry that will be
                    felt by those who are not too supercilious.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): This rhyming passage, in mixed verses of five, six, and seven feet,
                    keeps the tone light, and prevents us from taking at all earnestly what could be
                    a serious and bitter exchange.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Irregular trimeter couplets, used also in Love’s
                        Labour’s Lost (for example, IV.i). Some lines have four stresses,
                    some five, and some six.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): Lines vary from four to seven stresses. Many early
                commentators argue that this doggerel verse is evidence of a pre-Shn. play; see . Oliphant (1909, p. 349): There are
                    three possible solutions of the authorship of the doggrel passages [in LLL, TGV, and Err.]—the first (that adopted by all the critics without exception)
                    is, that Shakspere wrote them as he wrote the rest of the three plays; the
                    second is, that he had a colleague . . . ; the third is, that Shakspere’s work
                    was in every case based on an early play by some other writer.
                O’Donnell
                (1997, pp. 403–8) provides the best defense of the metrics.

            hand . . . parchment] Cuningham (ed. 1907): Another instance of
                    Shakespeare’s strong liking for legal phraseology, as well as for a quibble. The
                    play on the legal meaning of hand is quite evident. He
                lists particular legal expressions or references on pp. xliii f. as
                part of an argument that Sh. could only have . . . acquired [such
                    terminology] . . . as an apprentice to the law before he turned to the

                1817, 2:293): This is cross-purpose reasoning. It appears Dromio is an ass,
                    by his making no resistance, because an ass, being kicked, kicks again,
                reading doth n’t (634).
                    Theobald
                (ed. 1733): Our Author never argues at this wild Rate, where his Text is
                    genuine.
                Johnson (ed.
                1765): [Dromio] first says, that his wrongs and blows prove him an ass; but
                    immediately, with a correction of his former sentiment, such as may be hourly
                    observed in conversation, he observes that, if he had been an ass, he should, when he was kicked, have kicked again [i.e., back].
                Irving &amp; Marshall (ed. 1888): Theobald altered doth to don’t [sic]; but surely
                    without any reason. He thought Dromio meant to say he was an ass for making no
                    resistance, because an ass, being kicked, kicks again. But the
                    donkey, from time immemorial, has been celebrated for the patience with which he
                    endures kicks and blows. Dromio adds, I should
                        kick, being kicked, that is, I ought
                        to kick, in which case, he says to his master, You would keep
                        from my heels and beware of an ass. But it is because he deserves
                    the name of ass, that he makes no resistance.

                    (see notes to [639–40, 642]), and cast
                    in rhyme; it is, of course, not a serious debate, but a trial of courtesy,
                    recalling, as H. F. Brooks [Gen. Ed.] points out, the custom of discussing a set
                    theme at a supper or social gathering, citing especially Lyly, Euphues and his England (ed. 1902, 2:161–2). Tetzeli von

                    the quality of his fare and Balthasar’s equally polite reassurances are nicely
                    comic in the light of our knowledge that their dinner is being eaten by someone
                    else.

                this line by Tilley; not in Dent (1981), probably because cheerful has a different meaning from cheer. See n.

            But . . . Crow] Gill (1930, p. 30): [Menaechmi] IV.ii.668–669. Menaechmus I finds himself locked out by
                    his wife. IV.iii.695–700. He is locked out by Erotium also.
                Wislicenus
                (1879, p. 95) points to Amphitruo 1.1 where Mercury as
                Sosia guards the house against the true Sosia, and 4.2, 4.3 where Mercury locks out
                the true husband and servant while Jupiter, disguised as the absent husband, makes
                love to Alcmena. (For 4.3 from the Supposita, see .) So Gill, p. 35. Most commentators emphasize how Sh. has made the dinner
                chaste, chaperoned by Luciana, but the temptation to imply that there was sex—not
                just adulterous, but incestuous sex, unbeknownst to the principals but not to the
                audience (see n. 815–39)—sometimes
                leads to misstatements, e.g., Jardine (1983, p. 44): And when she accidentally locks out her husband for the night (having
                    locked in the wrong twin, and retired to her quarters to try in
                    her wifely capacity to revive his flagging interest in her). . . . 
                Berry (1985,
                pp. 39–40) has perhaps a safer approach: The audience is now to be teased
                    with a sexual fantasy based on bawdy innuendo in staff (687), come(s) (683, 710), cake (725), It . . . sold (727–8), and knocke (782); then he says the intercourse never
                happened. OED, Partridge (1947), Colman (1974), and Williams
                (1994) partially corroborate the innuendo, Colman stating flatly that come has no orgasmic sense in Sh. Still, the clustering of
                these words in the charged circumstances suggests that some bawdiness is present.
                Such intercourse would be incestuous: Thou shal not discouer ye shame of thy brothers wife: for it is thy brothers shame (Lev. 18:16,
                    Geneva), where discouer ye shame
                is a euphemism for have intercourse with. Very few commentators
                remark on the possibility of incest, though Sh. would have found the prohibition in
                the Table of Prohibited Degrees usually hanging in the church porch; the
                prohibitions forbade marriage to a sister-in-law, but the then-current definition of
                incest prohibited intercourse . . . within the degree within which marriage
                    is prohibited. See n. 607–14.
        


        651
            doore is lockt] How this encounter was originally staged is puzzling, the
                more so because it was presumably presented at Gray’s Inn, Greenwich, Whitehall, the
                Theater, the Curtain, and the first if not the second Globe. The unanswered
                questions are (1) were both Dromios visible to all or some of the audience? (2)
                where do Luce, then Adriana stand so as not to be seen by E. Antipholus and his
                companions? There need be no single solution, the action being adapted to the
                physical characteristics of each theater. Dorsch (ed. 1988, pp. 23–5) shows drawings by
                C. Walter Hodges of two alternatives, a self-standing house with the
                occupants partially visible and the Ephesians outside, and a free-standing door held
                up by two stage hands, with everyone visible.

            Maud . . . towne] Foakes (ed. 1962): The
                    slanging-match had a long history in English drama before Shakespeare, in the
                    morality play especially; a notable example occurs in John Heywood’s The Foure PP (printed c.
                    1545), in Manly (1897, 1:499–500, ll. 499–555).
        


        652
            Maud . . . Ginn] Wells (ed. 1972): The
                    number of maids suggests a wealthy household; no doubt it was dictated partly by
                    metrical requirements. The names have attracted onomastic comment. Halliwell (ed.
                1854), regarding Ginn: A corruption of Jin, the nick-name for Joan, adding Maud from Matilda, Gillian from Julian. Dyce (1853,
                p. 28) says Ginn should be Jin, from Jinny. Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): Gillian and Ginn are perhaps Juliana and Jenny.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Ginn probably = Jenny; O.E.D., gin, sb.4, cites an
                    18th-century use of Gin of all trades as the female equivalent of
                        Jack of all trades.
                Berry (1985,
                p. 42): Suddenly Roman, Greek, Biblical, Mediterranean cease to bear upon the
                    dramatic experience. After all, we are back home. It is impossible to take
                    seriously a setback in which we are excluded from Bridget and Maud. Typically of
                        The Comedy of Errors, its playing with primal
                    anxieties is accompanied by signals of primal comfort.

                citing Mac. 5.3.15 (2232)
                    (OED, sb.2). Idem (ed. 1785) adds MND 3.2.9 (1031) and MV 1.1, erroneously for 2.5.46 (883). Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821) acknowledges Steevens’s citation, but the word certainly is a
                    contemptuous designation of a mean man, who is sometimes obliged to wear a patched coat, citing 658. Halliwell (ed. 1854) cites Warner’s (1595)
                translation: doating Patch (see ). Foakes
                (ed. 1962): But [the word] was well known long before the 1590s as the

        655
            hatch] Schmidt (1874, subst. 1): A half-door (OED, sb.1 1a). Foakes (ed. 1962), sit . . . hatch: Perhaps = be silent [OED 1b; he cites Tilley (H207) though
                    Tilley does not mention Err.]. But the
                        hatch might refer to part of the stage structure; conceivably
                    Dromio is speaking through a grating or half-door in the upper part of a stage
                    door, and tells Dromio of Ephesus to sit at the hatch . . . out of his sight.
                    Clearly Dromio of Syracuse is not visible to Dromio and Antipholus of
                    Ephesus. On the modern stage, sometimes S. Dromio is not seen by the
                audience either; sometimes the door is imaginary.

        677–8
            face . . . asse] Foakes (ed. 1962) summarizes best: No one has
                    made sense of F here, and some emendation seems necessary. The
                    conjecture of Collier [1853], altering ass to face, is a sad weakening of the line, and [Wilson,
                    ed. 1922, p. 81] was the first, with [his] brilliant suggestion of an
                        aim (= butt or mark) [OED,
                            sb. 6] for a name, to show
                    what the point of the line probably is (cf. Kökeritz [1953], p. 90). Dover
                    Wilson noted that Dromio is referring to his recent experiences, to the changing
                    of his name for that of an ass at [633–7], and to the beatings
                    he received from Antipholus at [247
                    ff.] and from Adriana at [354],
                    which have made him an aim or target for blows; he also drew
                    attention to the similar quibbling jests on ell and nell [900–1], and ears and years [1311].
                    He retained . . . face, which is here emended to office; face has no antecedent, whereas name recalls Dromio’s opening words in this speech [quotes 673–4], and it
                    is natural to assume that he is still speaking about these things three lines
                    later. Palaeographically, this is not too difficult, especially if the initial
                        o was a mere dot; the change of an
                        aime to a name is easily explicable as a minim
                    misreading.
                Wells &amp;
                        Taylor (ed. 1986) simplify the minim
                misreading by emending to ame, a form of aim in the 13th–17th c. Halliwell (ed. 1854), White (ed. 1857), and Irving &amp; Marshall (ed. 1888) echo Collier (1853, p. 81),
                    face for asse: Another change for
                    the better, both as regards the rhyme and the sense.
                Wilson (ed.
                1962) compares R3 4.4.90
                (2860). Wells (ed. 1972): As it stands it might mean You
                        would have been willing to exchange your face
                            (identity) for someone else’s name
                        (so as to evade blame), or your name for that of an
                            ass (as an acknowledgement of the reality of the
                        situation). . . . Certainly puns are to be suspected in a passage
                    like this; ass rhyming with place
                    suggests one on an ass and an ace, though
                    the joke would seem neither clear nor very uproarious.
                Wells &amp; Taylor (1987, p. 267), reading pate: Dromio’s face is not the target of his
                    master’s and mistress’s anger, which is repeatedly aimed at his
                        pate. . . . The conjectured c/t misreading is common; for
                    p/f compare Hamlet 5.2.9
                            [fall 3276; press variant paule]. The
                    error might also have been assisted here by assimilation to place
                    at the end of 3.1.46 [676].
        


        679
            Enter Luce] See n. 651. Dyce (ed. 1857): This entrance and Adriana’s (706) may lead us to suspect that
                    both maid and mistress made their appearance on the balcony termed the upper stage, though they undoubtedly were supposed
                    not to see the persons at the door.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922), supposing the scene is clearly arranged for a public playhouse
                with upper and inner stages, locates S. Dromio behind the door or curtain at
                    the back of the inner-stage, while Luce and Adriana would appear on the balcony
                    which overhangs the inner-stage. He complains that the
                    within of eds. since Rowe would puzzle the audience with
                    three unseen characters, more especially as one of them [Luce] appears
                    nowhere else in the play. Yet he thinks that Gray’s Inn hall probably
                had no balcony, making within necessary; the present screen has a
                balcony, and Gray’s Inn tradition is that it was a gift from Queen Elizabeth after
                the Armada, but there is no firm evidence as to when it was installed (Caplan,
                1988). Though Luce-Nell does not appear elsewhere in the play (and perhaps not
                here), she becomes a regular onstage presence in the 19th c.; see, e.g., . Elliott (1939–40, p. 102): Sh.
                    refrains from bringing Nell onto the stage in person. The temptation to
                    do so must have been great; the scene would have rejoiced the hearts of ninety
                    percent of his audience.
                Mahood
                (1992, p. 6): The people inside apparently make no attempt to look out
                    [though some eds. want her to appear]. But such devices impose upon the tireman
                    the hard job of padding out a little scrubby boy in order to
                    present Luce as a mountain of flesh. . . .  Luce’s size is much better left to
                    our imagination, as it can be if all of her we ever see is her head at a window
                    or round the side of a door.

            Luce] See . Hanmer (ed. 1744, 6:Glossary): A Pike [fish]
                    or Jack (OED, Luce1). Becket (1815, 2:304), whimsically:

                    morning.
                Chambers
                (1930, 1:309): The kitchen vestal is called Luce in [679] and Nell in [900]. . . .  I think that Shakespeare altered his
                    name, either to get his pun on an ell [900] or to avoid confusion with Luciana, and forgot
                    to correct [679].
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) calls her the wife of Dromio of Ephesus; see 1908, which instead seems to look forward to a
                conventional marriage at the conclusion of a comedy, and see , which details uncertainty about whether the two are
                married. See also Bland (ed. Gesta Grayorum 1968, pp.

                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928) and Foakes argue for or suggest a literal staff borne by Dromio to
                underline the proverb. Hasler (1974, pp. 16–17) lists as a gestic quibble:
                    passages where the wordplay is not merely illustrated by a gesture which
                    accompanies it, but positively depends on what is going on the
                        stage. . . . This line is only effective if Dromio actually carries
                    a staff and enacts the literal meaning of the proverbial expression.
                OED (Staff sb.1 5d): To set up (or †in) one’s staff
                    (of rest) cites this line, but of all the citations only this one uses

            when . . . tell] Proverbial as an expression of defiance; see Tilley (T88),
                citing 1H4 2.1.42 (674); Dent (1981)
                adds Tit. 1.1.202 (231). Baldwin

            Luce, Luce] White (ed.
                1857): To understand Dromio of Syracuse’s
                    commendation . . . , it is necessary to remember that a pike was called a
                    luce.
                Hudson (ed.
                1880): Luce is an old name for the fish called pike [OED, Luce,
                        and Pike sb.4],
                    which seems to be the turning-point of the quibble here. Perhaps the sense of
                        thrusting with a pike is implied, as Luce has aptly
                    met proverb with proverb.

            hope] Emended to trow without comment by Theobald (ed.
                1733). Capell (1774, Glossary, I trow): Trust.
                Malone (ed.
                1790): A line either preceding or following this, has, I believe, been lost.
                    Mr. Theobald and the subsequent editors read—I trow; but
                    that word, and hope, were not likely to be confounded by
                    either the eye or the ear.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1793): Expect, citing Ant. 2.1.38–9 (662–3); OED (v. 3). Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821), noting that trow makes a triplet, says that Steevens’s
                gloss is beside his point of a lost line in which the speaker threatened Luce
                    with the corporal correction of a rope, which might have furnished the rhyme now
                    wanting. In a subsequent scene he puts the threat which I imagine was made here
                    into execution, quoting 998–9. White (ed. 1857), supporting Malone, adds that 694–7
                are not only without point, but actually without a subject.
                Keightley
                    (Expositor, 1867, p. 92) provides the missing line:
                    I thought to have ask’d you, had you brought a
                        rope.—I ask’d you to let us in, and you said,
                    No.
                Halliwell (ed.
                1854): A line, without its corresponding rhyme, in comical doggrel . . . ,
                    is not without precedent, without examples. In support of trow, Cuningham (ed. 1907) adopts it as the least
                    of the evils. In the mouth of Antiph. E. hope damns itself. It is
                    far too weak. Trow here would have the meaning I feel
                        sure,
                    I’m pretty certain. I see no objection to making the line form a
                    triplet, noting triplets at 711–14, 716–20, 733–6. Foakes (ed. 1962): The point of Luce’s
                    remark, I thought to have ask’d you, is that she has just defied
                    Dromio of Ephesus with when? can you tell?, and to the further
                    question from his master she replies with another mocking retort (so Tilley, T
                    225, and see Lyly, Mother Bombie, IV.ii.36 [ed. 1902,
                    3:209]). Dromio of Syracuse follows this up by remarking that she has already
                    said no to the question Antipholus asks—see l. [683–4]. I take it that as he
                    questions, Antipholus beats on the door, and receives mental blows in the form
                    of saucy retorts as a return for his physical blows; this would explain
                        blow for blow, l. [696–7]. But I am not sure that this
                    interpretation could easily be made to emerge in performance.
        


        694–5
            I . . . no] Tannenbaum (1932, p. 120): [Luce] answers facetiously,
                        I was about to invite you, clearly implying she intended no
                    such thing. Dromio, understanding her perfectly, says to his master, that
                        she intended to ask you in is just as true as that you said
                            no to her invitation.
        


        696–7
            blow for blow] Wells (ed. 1972): The action is uncertain. Perhaps
                    Dromio of Ephesus gets his master to help him in beating alternately. An
                alternative, he continues, is Foakes’s explanation (n. 693).

            Enter Adriana] See n. 679. Tannenbaum (1932, p. 121): Had Shakespeare
                    located a part of this scene above, he would have found it
                    difficult to account for the non-appearance of Syracusian Antipholus. The
                    appearance of Antipholus above would have made recognition of the two
                    Antipholuses inevitable and would have ended the play. That is why Shakespeare
                    made Adriana say that they would dine alone [see n. 603] that
                        day—alone implying a remote and private part of the house,
                    where Antipholus would not hear the disturbance at the gate.

                1962) compares LLL 5.2.371–2
                    (2298–9): I dare not call them fooles; but this I thinke, When they
                    are thirstie, fooles would faine haue drinke. In contrast, Foakes (ed.
                1962): Dromio’s point seems to be that if his master is sir
                        knave to Adriana, then he, who is properly a knave,
                    i.e. servant, is worse off still; if his master goes in pain, then he will
                    suffer indeed. In pain could mean under threat of
                        punishment (cf. the reference to the stocks, l. [704], and 2H6, III.ii.257 [1969]), or simply punished
                    (cf. Meas., II.iv.86
                    [1094]), and sore suggests a worse punishment, another
                    drubbing perhaps.

                    (Tilley
                [C12]). Neither Tilley nor Dent (1981) lists Err. for
                this proverb. Foakes (ed. 1962): Probably a quibbling reference to
                    Adriana is intended, citing Shr. 1.1.109 ff. (413 ff.), Tro. 1.1.15 ff. (50 ff.). Wells (ed. 1972): Adriana is warm

                1962) and Dorsch (ed. 1988) cite Tilley (B69[2]): As wild as a
                    Buck, citing this line, as proverbial for anger; not in Dent (1981).
                The proverb lacks the sense of rut that Cuningham and Berry detect.
        


        727–8
            bought and sold] Proverbial for be deceived; see Tilley
                (B787).
        


        729–30
            break . . . Breake] Turner (1974, p. 13): To take a central word
                    from an opponent’s statement, twist it into a new context, and turn it against
                    him is in itself an act of power, a control of an opponent’s weapons that is
                    both surprising and impudent. This verbal interplay works precisely to transform
                    into a dramatic experience what would otherwise remain a flat
                    occurrence. He compares the Err. passage with
                    1H6 1.3.7–12 (366–71).
        


        729
            break . . . gate] Wislicenus (1879, pp. 91–2) compares a non-Plautine
                addition to Amphitruo found in 16th-c. editions of Plautus:
                    What, rascal, would you be for driving me away from my own house? What,
                        would you hinder me from knocking at my own door?
                    I’ll this instant tear it from off all its hinges (see ). So Gill (1930, p. 36); she too refers to the
                non-Plautine Supposita, designating it 4.3.
        


        730
            Breake any breaking] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821) cites R2 2.3.87 (1198). Halliwell (ed. 1854):
                    Tinkers, quod you, tinke me no tinkes, I’ll meddle
                    with them no more, Common Conditions, 1570.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): A threatening way of saying if you break
                    anything, comparing Rom. 3.5.152 (2193), Thank me no thankings, nor proud
                    me no prouds. Wells is right, but the citations use the me construction, making them idiomatically distinct.
        


        732
            breake a word] Foakes (ed. 1962): The phrase is usually break a jest, or break news, but
                    it is altered here for the sake of the quibble.
        


        732
            breake] Wilson (ed. 1922, Glossary): (a)
                        [734] breaking wind, (b) [735–6] cutting up a deer or hind after the
                    kill (OED, Break v. 47, 2b).

        735
            seemes] White (ed. 1857): It would appear from the rhythm that
                    the ancient dissyllabic pronunciation was intended; else why was
                        wantest contracted? So, in [739] we have I when fowles [where] a second syllable [is] equally desirable for
                    the rhythm, basing his arguments on the supposition that the scene was
                written before Shakespeare’s day. Compositor D, setting near the end
                of H3vb, had justifying problems, e.g., no space between
                the SP and It (cf. the same crowding between SP and A in the last line of the column, though the unspaced commas
                are his preference); the spellings and contraction probably reflect typesetting
                rather than linguistic matters.
        


        735
            thou want’st breaking] Foakes (ed. 1962): I.e. you deserve a beating
                    (cf. [730]); and, you need to be
                    disciplined (broken in like a horse) (OED, Break v. 14).
        


        735
            out vpon] OED (Out int. 2b): Expressing abhorrence or
                    reproach. In the next line, E. Dromio’s pun means We’re too much
                    aware you want us outside.
        


        736
            hinde] Schmidt (1874, Hind 2): A boor (OED, sb.2 3). Foakes (ed. 1962): [Wilson,
                    ed. 1922] sees a reference to cutting up a deer after the kill [called
                        breaking] . . . which is quite inappropriate, though hind was perhaps suggested by buck, l. [727]. See n.
                    732.
        


        739–40
            fowles . . . fin] Halliwell (ed. 1854) cites Warner’s (1595)
                translation: birdes that beare feathers, or fishes that haue finnes
                (see ). Foakes (ed. 1962, p. xxvi) quotes
                Plautus: Latin avis squamosas, piscis pennatos,
                    l. 918, i.e. birds with scales, fish with feathers. Sh. fails to make
                that joke.
        


        741
            crow] Crowbar (OED, sb.1 5). Tetzeli von
                        Rosador (ed. 1982) wonders whether this is an allusion to the
                fact that door knockers had the shape of crows in Elizabethan times (OED, sb.1 7, which is inconclusive).
        


        744
            plucke . . . together] Proverbial for settle an argument; see Tilley
                (C855). Steevens (ed. 1793) misquotes Plautus, Captivi 1004, for a similar play on bird and crowbar:
                    Tyndarus . . . says, that for his part he had—tantum upupam. Upupa signifies both a lapwing and a mattock, or some
                    instrument of the same kind, employed to dig stones from the quarries
                (tr. Nixon, 1917, 1:562). The correct reading is upupa, without tantum. Foakes (ed. 1962): He is addressing the other Dromio
                    behind the door, as his familiar sirrah shows; their enmity here
                    contrasts with their departure at the end of the play hand in
                        hand [1918] in loving
                    harmony.

            Once this] Abbott (§57): In a word, from Once for
                    all, citing this line (OED, adv. 3). Schmidt (1875, Once 2): = so much is
                    certain. No examples duplicate Once this, so
                possibly: Only—this your.
        


        750–2
            of your . . . your] White (ed. 1857) notes frequent abbreviations in
                    F shown as ye, yr, yt: Hence the easy mistake
                    of her, the h having a bow below the line,
                    for yr. These logotypes—in which the second letter is set
                in the fork of the y—are used to save space when a compositor
                has difficulty setting his allotted words in the space available. In Err., such types cluster in H3v,
                the first page set by Compositor D from cast-off copy; the page has other signs of
                tight setting. Compositor C, setting H4a (the forme mate
                of H3v), uses none of those contractions. Foakes (ed.
                1962): Probably a slip of the eye carrying over from the three uses of your in ll. [747, 749, 750].
        


        751
            vertue] Schmidt (1875, Virtue 1): Moral goodness (OED, sb.

        752
            Plead] The subject is experience; perhaps the
                intervening list of her qualities made Sh. forget the syntax. Or, Knowles
                (privately): I take the Plead to be either an
                    imperative or a volitive subjunctive, giving the whole clause a conditional
                    force, If you will just let your experience plead for some unknown cause,
                        then in good time she will reveal it.
        


        753

        754

        755–67
            Be . . . possession] Griffith (1775, p. 144): There is a sentiment
                    of great propriety and delicacy argued upon; in the dissuading a person from the
                    commission of an unseemly action, even though the thing itself might be
                    sufficiently justified in one’s own breast. A respect to decency, and the
                    opinion of the world, is an excellent bulwark to our virtues.
                Gill (1930,
                p. 54), quoting 755–8, notes that Blepharo, Amphitryon’s pilot, likewise counsels
                patience when Amphitryon is locked out of his house for a second time, and prevails,
                as does Balthaser (768); she thinks
                there is an influence.
        


        756

                the first occurrence.

            Tyger] Foakes (ed. 1962): Perhaps a London inn or brothel bore
                    this sign, but I have not found a reference to one. Eds. seem not to
                worry about why E. Antipholus invites them to eat there, but at 777 bids Angelo to bring the necklace to the Porcupine.
                    To her will we to dinner (775) is thus unclear.

                compares Oth. 5.1.37 (3126).

            For . . . possession] See textual note. Foakes (ed. 1962) summarizes the problem: [e’er] necessary metrically (euer
                    F), making possession a four-syllable
                    word, like succession in the preceding line.
                Boswell (ed.
                1821): If we were to read housed, the difficulty would
                    be got over by a very slight alteration.

                (ed. 1899): I.e. holds its ground securely, like an heir who has come into
                    his property.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922, Glossary, Succession), correctly: I.e. by begetting other slanders to
                    succeed it, so that the line of its heirs is never extinct.
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928), however: Slander is passed on from one person or
                        generation to another.

                    possession.

            You . . . me] Gill (1930, p. 30): [Menaechmi] IV.ii.668–674. Menaechmus I goes back to Erotium when he is
                    cast off by his wife. I.ii.130. Menaechmus I takes the mantle to the
                    courtezan. Commentators note that Sh. changes the infidelity in
                Plautus’s play to a chaste relationship. Baldwin (ed. 1928):
                    In this speech, Antipholus of Ephesus clears himself of overt act [sic]
                    against his marriage vow, but he admits sufficient to show us that Adriana had
                    grounds for being suspicious of him. Nor is he above playing upon her known
                    jealousy to punish her. Presumably then he has previously humored the idea of
                    his attachment to this woman in order to tease his wife. Under the
                    circumstances, Adriana has naturally continued to upbraid him with the woman.
                    Shakespeare does not make either Adriana a shrew or Antipholus . . . an
                    unfaithful husband; but he has given each sufficient of those and other human
                    characteristics to account for their misunderstanding, yet without losing our
                    sympathy for them. This is fair, but an actor may deny the disclaimer at
                    773 with a wink. See  for Schlösser’s
                (1977) denial of the disclaimer.

                1817, 2:294): In despight of what mirth? We do not find that it was any joke,
                    or matter of mirth, to be shut out of doors by his wife. May we not restore it
                    [wrath]? His passion is plain enough all through this scene; and again, at [1363] he confesses how angry he
                    was. Among recent eds. Cuningham (ed. 1907) finds that Theobald’s
                    reading is satisfactory, in fact certain, and Wilson (ed. 1922) that wrath is
                    simpler and possibly the true reading, mirth and
                        wrath being not unlike in English script. Most prefer
                    F, however. Warburton (ed. 1747): The old reading is
                    right; and the meaning is, I will be merry, even out of spight to mirth, which
                    is, now, of all things, the most unpleasing to me.
                Heath (1765,
                p. 197): That is, Though mirth hath withdrawn herself from me, and seems
                    determined to avoid me, yet in despight of her . . . I am resolved to be merry.
                    Mr. Warburton’s explanation differs very little from nonsense.
                Capell
                (1774, p. 74): Mirth is the mirth of
                    his wife and the people about her, whose odd behaviour he interprets a[s]
                    merriment; and says—he will spite, i.e. cross it, by
                    showing his little regard for it, which he could no way do better than by being
                    merry himself.
                Rann (ed.
                1786): To shew my contempt of this strange prank. The Clarkes (ed.
                1864): In spite of my disinclination for mirth, I mean to make merry.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): I.e. in defiance of mirth which runs counter to my present feelings;
                    this extends the normal sense of (in) despite of, meaning in defiance of another’s wish; cf.
                        Meas., I.ii.23
                    [120]. . . .  The phrase suggests his difficulty in overcoming his anger,
                    and the extremity of his action in going to the courtesan.
                    [Wrath] . . . reduces the line to a commonplace.

            Porpentine] OED (sb. 1δ): Porpentine was the form known to Shaks. who uses it 7 times, in 4 of
                    these as the sign of an inn. The form was current 1530–1657. The
                Courtesan’s house was presumably identified by the sign of a porcupine. Holme (1688,
                p. 182): They [hedgehogs, being discussed with porcupines] engender, standing
                    belly to belly, because their pricks or sharp quills suffer them not to have
                    copulation like dogs.

                Dyce (1844,
                pp. 27–8) mocks Collier (ed. 1842) for Porcupine (see textual note) despite Collier’s note
                in John Northbrooke’s Treatise against Dicing (?1577;
                Shakespeare Society, 1843, p. 186) explaining that Porpentine was the form in Err.; and mocks Knight (ed. 1842) for inconsistently using
                Porpentine in Err. but porcupine in 2H6 3.1.363 (1669) and Tro. 2.1.26 (883). Fripp (1938, 1:315, n. 4)
                crediting Eleanore Boswell, TLS, 13 Nov. 1930: An
                    Exchequer document of 1624 (E. 133/12, no. 19) mentions a messuage [i.e.,
                        a dwelling house with its adjacent land and outbuildings] called the
                        Porpentine scituate on the Bank Side.

                    1752. Kolin (1997–8, p. 6):
                    The Porpentine (porcupine) is linked . . . to Circean transformations
                    into bestiality. . . .  Famous for its barbed quills, signifiers of both
                    tainted sex and violent aggression, the porpentine appropriately becomes the
                    totem animal for [E.] Antipholus’s transformation from lawful citizen and
                    espoused husband into public threat and enraged cuckold. Antipholus infects his
                    marriage when he gives away his wife’s chain (a symbol of the marital bond) and
                    steals another woman’s ring, a sign of the conjugal sex act. Kolin seems
                to accept the Courtesan’s lie at 1275–9.

            Exeunt] See textual note. Wells &amp; Taylor
                (1987, p. 268): Dromio could exit earlier, but it seems desirable to indicate
                    that the characters exit in three different directions.

            Enter . . . Siracusia] Dyce (ed. 1857): This
                    location [A street near the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse] is
                    awkward enough: but I know not what other to adopt. We can hardly suppose that
                    Luciana and Ant. S. now enter from the door of the house
                    as soon as the stage has been left vacant by the departure of Antipholus E. and
                    his companions. But for the entrance of Angelo at [955], I should have marked the scene as laid in the
                    garden of Ant. E.’s house: and there, indeed, the poet may have intended the
                    audience to fancy that it passed, until the exit of Dromio S . . . ; after
                    which they were to consider Antipholus as standing in the street. . . .  The
                    spectators of those days (when painted movable scenery was not in use) were
                    frequently obliged to imagine such changes of place.
                Idem (ed.
                1864): I now have no doubt about the entry from the door of the
                house. Baldwin (1947, pp. 710–11), demonstrating Sh.’s use of Terentian
                five-act structure: We must now begin to work toward this formula-determined
                    objective of the third act. Antipholus of Syracuse proposes to Luciana, who is
                    shocked that he should deny his wife Adriana, and so she goes out to fetch
                    sister. Here is epitetical action [the complicating action following the
                    protasis, or introductory action] in such love story as there is. [He summarizes
                    the plot.] Antipholus of Syracuse is now at the end of the third act attempting
                    to leave these witches at once. As has been said, this also is epitetical action
                    on his side, since if he leaves, solution is blocked.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): No break in the action is indicated here—as one group of characters
                    leaves, the other group enters from the house—through the door that Dromio of
                    Syracuse has been guarding. [Lines 787–839] are in quatrains, and [840–60] in
                    rhyming couplets; so Shakespeare modulates from the doggerel of the comic
                    business attending the locking-out of Antipholus of Ephesus, through the blank
                    verse of his and Balthasar’s consideration of what to do, to a lyrical
                    patterning in this attempt by Antipholus of Syracuse to make love to Luciana;
                    this in turn is broken at the entry of Dromio at l. [861], with a return to the prose of a burlesque
                    catechism, which is followed by a return to the blank verse of normal
                    intercourse for the dealing between Antipholus and Angelo, though both Dromio
                    and Antipholus go off on a rhyme.
        


        786–7
            Iuliana . . . Iulia] For Luciana, Lucia. Compositor C sets these names on
                    H4a, seeing them (i.e., whatever he saw) for the
                first time in the setting of the play; setting of Err.
                began with the forme H3v–H4. Compositor D set H4b, reading the speech headings correctly. Werstine
                (1988, p. 240): The substitution . . . is almost certainly compositorial.
                    Compositor C probably misread Luciana on
                    seeing it for the first time. Earlier eds., without the benefit of
                detailed bibliographical analysis, accounted for the mistakes variously. Baldwin
                (ed. 1928): Some have supposed that Shakespeare at one time thought of
                    calling this character Juliana. But the misreading is of a common type in
                    Elizabethan handwriting, and is pretty certainly due to the printer,
                citing Kellner (1925) §101, j misprinted for l; §106, l misprinted for c. Foakes (ed. 1962): It is difficult to account for [this
                    error] except as a slip of the author (perhaps momentarily thinking of Julia in
                        Two Gentlemen of Verona?).
                Wells (ed.
                1972) and Dorsch (ed. 1988) echo this notion of influence, implying that
                    TGV precedes Err.
        


        787–860
            And . . . will] Foakes (ed. 1962): These lines recall, in manner, in
                    their patterning in rhyme, in the stichomythic exchange at [840–50], the debate between
                    Adriana and Luciana in [2.1]. Luciana is, in effect, continuing that discussion
                    on the proper relationship of husband and wife, but is hardly prepared for the
                    response she gets.

            Antipholus] Capell (1774, p. 74):
                    All modern editions . . . give us—Antipholis; a
                    word not of Grecian original, and one whose termination was never seen among
                    them in names given to men: the folio’s have sometimes—Antipolis; Antipholis, generally; but, in this and a few other places,
                            Antipholus; which suggested the
                    true and right name; and that, the alteration above
                    [ruinous].
                Steevens
                (ed. 1778): Perhaps . . . we should read Antiphilus,
                    a name which Shakespeare might have found in P[hilemon] Holland’s translation of
                    Pliny, B. xxxv, and xxxvii. Antiphilis was a famous
                    painter, and rival to Apelles. . . .  Throughout the first folio, Antipholus occurs much more often than Antipholis, even where the rhime is not concerned; and were the rhime
                    defective here, such transgressions are accounted for in other
                places.

            spring] The implication that the marriage is very recent is apparently
                countered by 1633–5. In Menaechmi the marriage appears to be
                of long standing. See n. 505–41.

                note. Observing the alternating rhyme of 787–839, commentators either (1) add to 788 to make a rhyme with ruinate or (2) change it to ruinous.
            
                (1) Theobald (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                    1817, 2:294–5): [Rhyme] is broke in [788, 790]. Sure this must then be through the fault of the

                        the tail of the second line), conjecturing hate in 788, ruinate in 790. Heath (1765, p. 197): Theobald . . . did not carry
                        his correction far enough, and I suspect that the poet wrote shall a nipping hate.
                    Mason

                        Idea.
                    Malone
                    (in Boswell, ed. 1821), agreeing with Mason: Our poet, I
                        think, generally used to rot as a neutral
                        [intransitive] verb.
                    Wilson
                    (ed. 1922): The modern reader must take his choice; we incline to
                        Theobald’s reading, since ruinate has the true Shakespearian
                        ring. . . .  Moreover, rot as a transitive verb seems a
                        distinct improvement.
                    Foakes
                    (ed. 1962) objects to Wilson’s true Shakespearian ring: In
                        fact, the word is used only as a verb by Shakespeare [hence here it is not
                        distinctive], who always employs the adjective ruinous, as in the similar image from Gent. [5.4.7–10

                (2) Theobald, in the letter of (1) above, alternatively
                    conjectures thus . . . ruinous, but omits it as a conjecture in
                    ed. 1733. Sisson (1956, 1:93): Theobald’s Antipholus hate, to rhyme with ruinate,
                        introduc[es] a very forced thought into an otherwise clear sequence, and a
                        freer verse than is normal in this play. The obvious alternative is ruinous. . . .  That the compositor was careless
                        here is evidenced by his buildings for a certain building, but I do not see any other plausibility
                        except that ruinous and ruinate are synonyms.

        793–814
            Or . . . strife] Sarrazin (1897, p. 113) sees similarities between
                    793–6 and Son. 139.3–5. Rick (1919,
                p. 38) compares Ovid, Amores 3.14. 5–6: She does not
                    sin who can deny her sin, and ’tis only the fault avowed that brings
                    dishonour; ll. 14–15, Let me think you honest though you are not.
                    What you are doing, continue to do; only deny that you have done (tr.
                Showerman, 1914, p. 501). Wells (ed. 1972): These sophistical arguments sound
                    oddly on Luciana’s lips. They closely resemble . . . Ovid’s Amores [3.14], with which Shakespeare appears to have been eking
                    out his invention. Compare [801–2] with Ovid (Marlowe’s translation [13.7–8,
                    ed. 1973, 2:390]) What madness is’t to tell night’s pranks by day, And
                        hidden secrets openly to bewray?

        794–5
            Muffle . . . eye] Foakes (ed. 1962): The sense jumps from
                    muffle = conceal to its special meaning, to blindfold (cf. Rom., I.i.169 [176]), and so to the
                    rest of the image (OED, Muffle
                        v.1 c, quoting this line;
                    2).

                line).
        


        795–6
            Let . . . Orator] Quasi-proverbial; Tilley (T140): It is
                    an ill Thing to be wicked . . . but a worse to . . . boast of it;
                excluded by Dent (1981).

            Apparell . . . harbenger] Foakes (ed. 1962): Quasi-proverbial, cf.
                    Tilley, V44, Vice is often clothed in virtue’s habit (first
                    citation 1616); neither Tilley nor Dent (1981) lists Err. as using this proverb. Tetzeli von Rosador (ed.
                1982): The rarer meaning of apparel is used here: of cunning and cheating clothing
                and disguising (OED, [v. 8, citing this line as the first occurrence]). . . .  The
                dramatic tradition of the moralities and interludes, based on Prudentius, in which
                the Vices are disguised as Virtues, is metaphorically concentrated here (Ger.). He
                cites Tilley, and refers to Bernard Spivack, Shakespeare and the
                    Allegory of Evil (1958), pp. 85 ff.
        


        798

            Beare . . . tainted] Proverbial; see Tilley (F3): Fair Face

        801
            what . . . acquainted] Schmidt (1874, Acquaint): What need she know
                    it? (OED, v. 6b, citing this line as the first occurrence).

                    to brag.
        


        802
            attaine] Capell (1774, Glossary, Attaint): Taint,
                    Attainture (OED, Attaint sb. 6: Stain upon honour). OED attests no -e spellings, and all
                other F occurrences spell with a -t. Perhaps
                this is an e-t misprinting or
                misreading; cf. Kellner (1925, §79). Cuningham (ed. 1907): There is a legal
                    flavour in the word (OED 5
                = ATTAINDER, earliest citation 1603).

            truant with] Schmidt (1875, Truant vb.): To play the truant, to be
                    inconstant.
                OED does not attest this second sense; the first sense, of
                one neglecting one’s duty, may be sufficient—see 787–8. Foakes (ed. 1962): An odd
                    usage, not elsewhere found in Shakespeare.

                Wells (ed.
                1972), apparently adopting Schmidt’s inconstant: Luciana
                    assumes that Antipholus of Syracuse has committed the crime of which Antipholus
                    of Ephesus has just declared himself innocent [773].
        


        804
            boord] Schmidt (1874, Board subst. 2): Table (OED, sb. 6:
                    A table used for meals, as in bed and board). Cf. 1533.
        


        805
            Shame . . . managed] Rolfe (ed. 1881): Shame, if well managed,
                    gets a spurious reputation—a respectibility not legitimately its
                own.
        


        805
            bastard] Schmidt (1874, adj. 2): Spurious, adulterate
                    (OED, sb. and a. 4).
        


        805
            fame] Schmidt (1874, subst. 3): Reputation (OED, sb.1 3).

                    Theobald
                (1726, p. 174): Women . . . are so easy of Faith, that only make them
                    believe you love them, and they’ll take the bare Profession for the
                    Substance.
                Idem (ed.
                1733) asserts that the not-but error
                occurs frequently, but, in F, only here, MV 4.1.278 (2193), and Rom. 3.1.197 (1642). O’Connor
                (1977, p. 61) shows that Compositor C is likely to make substitutions owing to
                memorial error.

                and n. 568, where Adriana fastens
                on her husband’s sleeve. Foakes (ed. 1962): Luciana, present
                    then [567], recalls the image [as a
                    vine on elm] now, and develops it further.
                Tetzeli von
                        Rosador (ed. 1982) hears a good measure of cynicism in the
                repetition of 567.
        


        810
            motion] Schmidt (1875, 4): Motive, incitement (OED, sb. 7):

                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Perhaps here carries the sense orbit.
                OED (sb. 1a):
                    Process of moving, cites this line, but it seems an unlikely
                sense.
        


        811
            gentle] Schmidt (1874, adj. 2): Good, dear, sweet (OED, a. 3b). Cf.

        815–39
            Sweete . . . sinke] Baldwin (1944, 2:282–3): It was Erasmus who
                    gave Shakspere the pattern for this amatory speech of praise, quoting
                    De Conscribendis Epistolis: If we shall solicit
                    the mind of a girl to mutual love, we use especially two battering rams, praise
                    and pity. . . .  We will study to be as suppliant as possible [cf. 820–3]. We will
                    amplify vehemently their qualities; ours we will extenuate, or certainly proffer
                    with the greatest modesty. . . .  We will attempt to show our love as honest as
                    possible. Finally we will pray as modestly as possible that if she does not
                    deign to return the love of her lover . . . it is decreed with us in some way
                    to break off cruel life (The Collected Works,
                1985, 25:204–5, a very different translation from Baldwin’s). Frye (1970, p. 186):
                    The sentiment is thoroughly standard, and the inference of divinity in
                    the beloved is not only a stereotype of ideas but almost a cliché in expression.
                    The rhythms, though somewhat varied, are too neat to give the impression of
                    credible dialogue, and the rhymes are obtrusively da-dum-da-dum. The comparable
                    speech in The Tempest
                        [3.1.33–6 (1275–8)] is also expressed in four lines, but they are
                    unrhymed and so flexible in rhythm that they have almost become free verse,
                    while the reference to prayer provides an individualizing touch.
                Altman
                (1978, p. 172): It is both a courtly wooing speech, and a real plea for
                    enlightenment, but Luciana is not a goddess, and although she winds about his
                    soul’s pure truth the darker strands of her own, she cannot show him how they
                    relate to one another.

            your . . . else] Wells (ed. 1972): Other name you
                    have.
        


        817
            hit of] For Of [for]
                    on, see Abbott §175 and OED (Hit v. 11, 12): To come
                    upon.
        


        818–19
            Lesse . . . diuine] Milward (1967, pp. 174–5): Open references to
                    Our Lady are few and far between; but the language of Marian devotion is
                    frequently and significantly applied to the heroines. . . .  Even more
                    interesting are the many connections between woman and divine grace, which seem
                    to point to the Hail Mary, quoting these lines. But grace here is most likely beauty, attraction,
                    charm (Schmidt, 1874, subst. 2; OED, sb. 1).
        


        819–20
            Then . . . speake] Halliday (1954, pp. 71–2): The assonance is
                    emphasized by fixing it on trochaic words that immediately precede or succeed in
                    the middle of the line [quoting 819–20]. It is all very self-conscious and
                    unashamedly undramatic—Shakespeare has forgotten the play in the excitement of
                    the poetry.
        


        819
            our earths wonder] Douce (1807 1:367): There will be no
                    impropriety in supposing the above simile to have been designed as a compliment
                    to [Queen Elizabeth]. Pronounced with emphasis, it would not fail to make a due
                    impression on the audience.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962), acknowledging Douce: The play may have been performed before
                    her, citing the payment for performance at Greenwich on 27 or 28 Dec.
                1594. See .
        


        819
            more . . . diuine] I.e., you show yourself to be more than divine earth.
                    Knowles
                (privately): Perhaps diuine is a verb—you seem to know
                    more than the most wondrous of earth’s creatures, and divine more (e.g., my
                    name) than a mere human could. He then goes on to request information from her
                    as from an oracle or goddess.
        


        819
            earth diuine] Tetzeli von Rosador (ed. 1982) hears a reference to
                the dust from which humans were created (metonymy).
        


        821–5
            Lay open . . . vnknowne field] Babula (1972, p. 29): His request
                    is . . . couched . . . in language that can be associated with postlapsarian
                    man. Christian beliefs . . . can present man, having fallen, as a
                        wanderer in an unknown field. All men, like the fallen Adam,
                    have an understanding that is feeble, shallow, weak. Suitably,
                    Antipholus’ wit is limited, earthy-gross, bound to the world
                    rather than freed by heaven. Thus these Christian notions go to reinforce part
                    of the image of life the play is projecting: life is a complex beyond our
                    understanding.
        


        821–4
            grosse . . . truth] Foakes (ed. 1962): Gross
                        conceit is the dull apprehension which is all that mortals have in
                    relation to the gods, in Plato’s allegory of the cave, Republic, Book 7, or to the soul liberated from this muddy
                        vesture of decay [MV
                        5.1.64 (2476–7)] in Christian terms; but this is opposed to
                    Antipholus’s pure truth of soul, his absolute knowledge that it
                    is Luciana he loves.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): Platonic teaching, partly assimilated into Christian tradition, held
                    that the truth remained obscure to us in the flesh but would be revealed when we
                    are released from it into the soul’s pure truth ([824]). Shakespeare is admitting
                    another kind of divided self (the gross and the pure). For the Platonic [see
                        MV above]. In the ordinary world, however,
                    Antipholus hopes that Luciana will make sense of what look to him like lies
                        (words’ deceit). It is not clear whether Foakes and
                Dorsch mean that Shakespeare was using the Republic. Baldwin
                MS points to Aeneid 6.730–4: Fiery is the vigour and
                    divine the source of those life-seeds [i.e., souls], so far as harmful bodies
                    clog them not, nor earthly limits and mortal frames dull them. Hence their fears
                    and desires, their griefs and joys; nor discern they the light, pent up in the
                    gloom of their dark dungeon (tr. Fairclough, 1930; 1934, 1:557). He says
                this passage lies behind both MV and Err., though the idea would have been available in numerous
                    other places besides Plato and Virgil. See Baldwin (1944, 2:493–4) for
                more comment on this Vergilian passage.

                    clear hard-edged Mediterranean brilliance of Plautus, but something richer, more
                    golden, almost more oriental. Those wonderful words of Antipholus of
                    Syracuse . . . express the idea of holiness that we can see has enchanted
                    Shakespeare in his very beginnings.

            Transforme] Foakes (ed. 1962): This is metamorphosis of a different
                    kind from the Dromios’ sense of being changed to asses [868, 595, 637]; Antipholus
                    would willingly change his identity to serve her.

            Nor . . . no] See textual
                    note. Halliwell (ed. 1854, 1:295): The editor of the second
                    folio was accustomed to modernize the original text, adapting the language to
                    the changes that had been made in grammatical usages. Thus few idioms were more
                    common in Shakespeare’s time than the use of the double negative. . . .  The
                    beauty of the verse is sensibly impaired by the grammatical
                    modernization.
                Abbott
                (§406): Many irregularities may be explained by the desire of emphasis which
                    suggests repetition, even where repetition, as in the case of a negative,
                    neutralizes the original phrase.

                1821): Far more do I fall off or decline from her to you. Most eds.
                use incline without Malone’s elaboration. Foakes (ed.
                1962): Here it seems to carry the sense of turning away from
                Adriana.

            Oh . . . sinke] Knight (ed. 1842, 1:205): Antipholus of Syracuse is one
                    of Shakspere’s amiable creations. . . .  He is an enthusiast, for he falls in
                    love with Luciana in the midst of his perplexities, and his lips utter some of
                    the most exquisite poetry.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): The idea of loss of identity through drowning (here presented as a
                    desirable fate when undergone for the sake of love) refers back to the sea
                    imagery of 199–200, 521–4.

            Mermaide . . . Siren] OED notes that they were
                often from early times confused with each other. (Mermaid 3): Applied to a
                    prostitute, citing 832 as
                the first occurrence, probably on the basis of deceit (823–32); the
                interpretation seems implausible here. Ibid. (Siren 2):
                        Classical Mythol. One of several fabulous
                    monsters, part woman, part bird, who were supposed to lure sailors to their

                citing 834 as the first occurrence. Root (1903,
                pp. 107–8) assembles the Shn. occurrences: MND 2.1.150 (526); Son. 119.1; Tit. 2.1.23 (577); Ven. 429; Luc. 1411; Ham. 4.7.176 (3168); Ant. 2.2.207, 209 (920, 922); 3H6 3.2.186 (1710). Root says: Of more
                    difficulty is the apparent reference to Siren’s tears [833, Son. 119.1]. Classical
                    literature furnishes no parallel; nor have I been able to find any in the
                    mermaid-stories of folk-lore. . . .  Siren tears may mean
                        deceptive tears; but the meaning is not clear. In Err. the
                    tears may be explained by the fact that Luciana’s sister has really been
                    weeping.
                OCD: S[irens] accompany the dead on their voyage to
                    the lower world. . . .  S. grieve for the dead with mournful songs.

                (1565, Dictionarium . . . propria locorum vocabula) on
                their failing to capture Ulysses/Odysseus: Wherfore ye Sirenes sorowed so much, yt thei wer

                    mermaydens.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Antipholus first thinks of Luciana as a goddess belonging to a higher
                    sphere of existence than his own ([826]), then wonders if she is deliberately trying to lead him astray,
                    like a siren, drawing him to confusion by claiming him for her sister.

                        [F2
                    sisters] is not grammatically necessary.
                Knight (ed.
                1842): Sister is more elegant, using the noun
                    adjectively, which is frequent with Shakspere. Eds. who retain sister floud do not explain the meaning; perhaps
                    sisterly, in sympathy, meaning that Luciana is weeping as Adriana
                had at 600.

                explains his hears because in his early plays
                    Shakespeare indulged in riming archaisms of this kind occasionally, and
                notes hear-tear-ear rhymes in, e.g., Ven. 51, 147, 1129.
        


        836
            bud . . . thee] See textual notes. Edwards (1748; 1765, p. 184): I suspect, there is a
                    slight mistake of one letter in the third line; we should read them for thee, also reading bed for bud. Steevens (ed. 1778): Mr.
                    Edwards suspects a mistake of one letter in the passage, and would read [bed, them]. Perhaps, however, both the ancient readings
                    may be right [bud, thee]: i.e. I, like an insect, will
                    take thy bosom for a rose, or some other flower, and,—phoenix-like,
                        beneath thine eye, Involv’d in fragrance, burn and die. It is common
                    for Shakespeare to shift hastily from one image to another. Mr. Edwards’s
                    conjecture may, however, receive support from [TGV 1.2.111–12 (274–5)] —my bosom as a bed Shall lodge thee.
                Malone (ed.
                1790): Bed, which the word lie
                    fully supports.
                Dyce (ed.
                1857): [F2] gives a sort of sense to the passage, and has
                    become the usual modern reading. But surely the author’s word could have been no
                    other than what I have substituted [bride].
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): In some English hands . . . an open e might be
                    mistaken for u. Possibly simply a compositor’s
                    slip.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): [Bed] is not wholly satisfactory, since it
                    makes almost ludicrously concrete what is already suggested in the full image;
                    on the other hand, it provides a proper antecedent for there.
                    Antipholus wants to take Luciana herself, and bud fits this meaning in its common use as an image for a maid, cf.
                        Rom., I.ii.29 [276],
                    and Lucr., 848. It is
                    tempting to restore bud, and to take hairs
                    as the antecedent of there.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): The image [bed] seems a little far-fetched,
                    and, as bed is an emendation . . . must be somewhat
                    suspect. But it gains support from lie, and the generally
                    erotic connotations of bed, lie, and die [838].
                Take may have a more benign sense than to
                    seize, especially since the phrase is take as
                    (OED, v. 49:
                    To regard, consider, hold, esteem). See next note.
        


        836
            thee] Werstine MS: F1
                    thee makes sense, but strays from Antipholus’s emphasis
                    on the Siren’s hair. Them clearly refers to the hair.
                    Were it not for Compositor D’s total misreading of this line indicated by his
                    substitution of bud for bed,
                    thee could be retained.
                O’Connor
                (1977, p. 61) points out that Compositor D’s mistakes are orthographically similar
                to what he misreads.

            supposition] Warburton (ed. 1747): For the thing lain open,
                i.e., idea, notion (OED 3b:
                    Imagination, fancy, quoting this line). Edwards (1748; 1765, pp.
                183–4): I suspect, that [Warburton’s] lain open is a
                    false print for lain upon; . . . supposition here is used, in its ordinary sense, for imagination, fancy. In the context of

                    masculine . . . [but] capable of being identified with Venus). The
                comparison is between the Siren (she) and Venus—If she (with
                her bed of hair on which I imagine myself lying) sink beneath the waves, then even
                light Love will also sink, being more ethereal than I.
        


        839
            being light, be] Malone (in Steevens, ed. 1793, light) cites Ven.
                    149–50: Love is a spirit, all compact of fire, Not gross to sink, but light, and will
                    aspire.
                Halliwell (ed.
                1854) cites LLL 4.3.382
                (1731), light wenches, i.e., wanton (OED, a.1 14b). Badham (1856, p. 274):
                    It seems impossible to make anything of the passage as it stands. I
                    believe that Antipholus was intended to say [be light, being] by which words he
                    at once addresses Luciana as Venus, and provokes her to lightness in returning
                    his passion.
                Hudson (ed.
                1880, p. 154): The original transposes be and being, which makes the line unintelligible to me.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): This [the whole line] has puzzled many; but Malone’s apt parallel from
                        [Ven. 149–50] seems
                    to make the meaning clear. Light = fire, and
                        drowned = extinguished, comparing Q2
                Ham. 4.7.190–1 (3184):
                    I have a speech a’ fire that fain would blaze, But that this folly drowns
                        [F: doubts] it.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): [Ven. 149–50]
                    illustrates something of the play on senses of light,
                    which is opposed to heaviness, to darkness (as drowned
                    may mean extinguished), and carries overtones of wantonness (as in light
                        of love). The line thus combines Antipholus’s passion for Luciana
                    with his suspicion of her as a siren luring him on by her deceit.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Love is light, so, if she sinks in these
                    circumstances, will be proved not truly to be love. See n. 1235.

            she] Heath (1765, p. 198): There is no person mentioned in
                    this whole passage, to whom the pronoun, she, can
                    possibly be referred; for Luciana is always addressed in the second
                    person; Heath proposes he.

            What . . . will] Foakes (ed. 1962): After the quatrains of the
                    two long speeches, the verse changes to couplets with this transition to the
                    quick interchange of stichomythia.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988) compares R3 1.2.131–50
                    (317–41), 192–202 (387–97). Wolfensperger (1994, p. 56): SAntipholus
                    tries almost literally to subject Luciana to the scheme of rhyming
                    couplets. . . .  In order to emphasize his alleged claim on Luciana,
                    SAntipholus believes he has to exert increasing pressure on her, if only with
                    the help of rhyming couplets. But . . . Luciana manages to get out of his
                    reach. . . .  Apart from the end rhyme ([860]), whose telling abruptness betrays her (pretended) firmness,
                    Luciana refuses to rhyme on SAntipholus.

            It . . . sight] Foakes (ed. 1962): The sight was regarded as the chief
                    of the senses, and it was a commonplace of poetic convention, inherited from the
                    literature of courtly love, that beauty, impinging on a man’s eye, might cause
                    him at once to fall in love; it was also respectable psychology, quoting
                Robert Burton, Anatomy of Melancholy (ed. A. R. Shilleto,
                1896, 3:76). For further discussion see Baldwin (1947, p. 591 on LLL) and Idem (1950, pp. 74 ff. on Ven.)
                citing Ficino, Reginald Scot, Castiglione. He continues: Of course, Luciana
                    regards the sudden passion of Antipholus not as rational love, but as mere lust;
                    a common Shakespearian meaning of her word fault [842] is offence,
                    sin (OED, sb. 5a).

                    lovers. When he calls her his heaven’s claim, I cannot
                    understand him. Perhaps he means that which he asks of heaven.

                    identified Luciana with himself [850], and now counters her All this my sister is with a
                    conceit: Call yourself sister, if you will; you have lost
                        your identity in me.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Call yourself your own sister, because I am identified with you as you

            good will] Schmidt (1875, Will subst. 3): Accord, consent,
                    approval (OED, Goodwill
                3a). Wells (ed. 1972): It is uncertain whether the actress
                    should play this as indicating sudden acceptance, or as a stratagem to escape
                    from an embarrassing situation. When Luciana reports to her sister, it is clear
                    that she has been attracted by Antipholus (see [1119–20]).
        


        862–945
            Why . . . wife] Capell (1774, pp. 74–5): The whole of this
                    act, and the last, passes before the door of Antiphilus Ephesian; out of which,
                    when Luciana has enter’d it, Dromio rushes wildly and suddenly, with the look
                    and actions of a man greatly frighten’d: The incident of his being lay’d claim
                    to, is truly comic; but his description of the claimant borders upon farce in
                    some parts of it, and in others is a little indelicate.
                Duport
                (1828, 1:273): Decency does not allow, in any way, a report of what Dromio says.
                This is one of Sh.’s insupportable faults. When he begins a vulgar pleasantry, he
                will not let go (Fr.). See n. 319–61
                for the mixture of prose and verse. Elliott (1939–40, p. 102): Dromio’s report of the
                spherical Nell is a superb burlesque of the wooing of Luciana by S.
                Antipholus. See n. 868.

        868
            asse] Foakes (ed. 1962): Dromio’s situation parallels and
                    parodies that of his master; Antipholus is claimed by Adriana, and by Luciana
                    for her sister, while Dromio is claimed by a kitchen-wench; as Antipholus speaks
                    of being transformed through love, created new ([826]), so Dromio too talks of being
                    metamorphosed—but into an ass, or beast ([877]), or dog ([935]). It
                    is another link in the chain of images of transformation or loss of
                    identity.
                Wyrick
                (1982, p. 441): Ass as a mediating metaphor bridges the two
                    wooing scenes in Act III, scene ii. . . .  This structurally parallel
                    interchange brings Antipholus of Syracuse from the ethereal cosmology with which
                    he praises his love for Luciana [853] to a bantering participation in the mundane geography which depicts
                    Dromio of Syracuse’s run-in with Luce [905]. It also reaffirms the farcical bawdiness which marks the
                    Dromios. See n. 288–9.

                White (ed.
                1857): Dromio says he is beside
                        himself, i.e., distracted; the idea that he is
                    another man than himself being conveyed by way of pun. He says that to
                emend to beside would suppress evidence of the variant,
                quoting Acts 26:24, in eds. 1535 (Taverner), 1599
                (Geneva-Tomson), 1607 (Geneva).

                    him. See next note.

            claime(s)] Foakes (ed. 1962): Contrasting with Antipholus’
                        claim to Luciana above [853], and comically underscoring both this and Adriana’s earlier
                    claims upon her husband (II.ii). See  for disagreements about whether Luce is married to E.
                Dromio, and cf. n. 884. Kökeritz
                (1953, p. 60): The quibbling has been carried to such extremes that even the
                    initiated will have to make a real effort to find his way through the maze of
                    meanings and homonyms. This is true above all of Dromio’s forced
                    witticisms . . . where we have in ll. [873–9] the homonyms claim-cleam, have-heave, horse-whores, abased-a
                    beast-baste-beastly.
                Ibid. (p. 88): [Luce’s]
                    greasiness is repeatedly referred to, directly as in [886] ff . . . and indirectly, I suspect, by the
                    use of such homonyms as claim-cleam
                    to smear, bedaub, stick to and beast(ly)-baste.
                Cercignani
                (1981, p. 12) denies all these homophones.

                    to expand it, cf. Mother Bombie, IV.ii.168ff [ed. 1902,

                Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821): This is a very old corruption of save-reverence, salvâ reverentiâ. In [Ado 3.4.32–3 (1531–2)] the more
                    correct expression occurs: I think you will have me say, save-reverence, a husband. See Blount’s

                White (ed.

                    excrement (OED, Sir-reverence

                    Menaechmi.

            grease] Spurgeon (1935, p. 118), sentimentally: [Sh.] has a
                    horror of greasy food. [This] we might guess as early as Dromio’s description of
                    his [sic] kitchen wench, who is all grease.
        


        890
            Poland Winter] Delius (ed. 1858): Poland is for a country situated anywhere in the north, where
                winter lasts very long (Ger.). Wilson (ed. 1922) compares MM 2.1.134 (586): This will last out a
                    night in Russia.
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928) compares Ham. 1.1.63

            doomesday, she’l burne] Harris (1933, pp. 254–5) suggests that Sh. saw the
                Coventry mystery plays, perhaps including the lost Doomsday:
                    Three worlds were always provided, one to be burnt at each
                    performance. . . .  The Cambridge editors [Wilson, ed.
                    1922] . . . note how often Dromio of Syracuse betrays a familiarity with the
                    old religious plays [1149, 1154–5], but
                    they do not notice this one.

            weeke longer] Halliwell (ed. 1854) proposes a barely possible
                pun on wick. OED
                    (Wick sb.1) testifies to
                    week = wick, citing FQ 2.10.30.
                See Kökeritz
                (1953, p. 153), but Cercignani (1981, p. 150) finds wick
                    unreliable. Spenser’s pronunciation appears to have differed from
                Sh.’s in some respects.
        


        892–929
            What . . . mee] Gentleman (ed. 1774) says of 892–5: There is a very
                    fulsome idea offered here, which should be consigned to oblivion, and of
                the rest: The allusions to countries have little humour and less decency in
                    them, wherefore they should be rejected. See  for the history of cuts of this passage.
        


        893
            Swart] Capell (1774, Glossary): Swarthy (OED, a. [sb.] 1b, citing this line). Eds. have difficulty
                defining the exact coloration, e.g., Steevens (ed. 1793): Black, or rather of a
                    dark brown. She is sooty from her fires; see 1362.
        


        894
            for why?] Dyce (1853, pp. 29–30) argues for deleting the question mark:
                            For why being equivalent to
                        because, for this reason that, comparing
                    A Warning for Fair Women (1599, sig. E4) and 2 The Troublesome Reign of King John (1588, ed. 1622, sig.
                L2). Idem
                (ed. 1857) adds TGV 3.1.99
                    (1168), R2 5.1.46–7
                    (2307) in F (where there is a question mark that he
                acknowledges). Halliwell (ed. 1854) adds some support, but It is,
                    however, by no means impossible that in many cases, and possibly [here], for why is to be construed something in this manner,—why
                    is it so? the reason is, &amp;c. Thus, in Willobie his Avisa, 1606,—For
                        why? the sword that Phineas wore is broken. . . . The interrogative
                    mode of punctuating this phrase is of such frequent occurrence, it is difficult
                    to believe it can be always attributed to the typographer.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): The Folio’s note of interrogation seems simpler here;
                    notwithstanding Dyce’s strong argument.

            sweats] Wilson (ed. 1922) says that some copies of F
                read swoats, but Baldwin (1964, p. 225) notes that Hinman (1963)
                records no press variants in H4v: The reading is
                    evidently the usual sweats, where the e in some
                    copies is not fully clear.

                    whose hero, Deucalion, he identified with Noah, but his citation of AYL 5.4.35 (2611) is clearly
                wrong, and of JC 1.2.152 (251)
                is probably Ovidian. Noble (1935, p. 276) adds TN 3.2.17–18 (1396–7), remarking on the popularity of

                    establishes the identity of Luce and Nell.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Shakespeare . . . altered her name for the sake of the quibble on ell, and perhaps to avoid possible confusion with

                    at

                1817, 2:295): This is a very odd and intricate passage, and has given me much
                    trouble. I can at last make some sense of it and in a footnote:
                        Nell, i.e. an ell.
                Collier (ed.
                1842): An ell Flemish is three quarters of a yard. Dromio
                    merely says, that an ell, or three quarters of a yard,
                        will not measure her from hip to hip. See n. 901 Ell. Halliwell (ed. 1854):
                    [Collier’s] interpretation, which is too subtle for the occasion,
                    destroys the humour of the speech. The Clarkes (ed. 1864): A
                    Flemish ell is three quarters of a yard; therefore a yard and a half will give
                    us the exact height and width of this broad-as-she’s-long
                        kitchen-wench. The English ell is 45 inches; see n.

                    error in comedies set from quarto copy. Like this one, most of these
                    substitutions are probably memorial, and involve copula and auxiliary verbs,
                    pronouns, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. For similar substitutions,

            globe] OED (sb. 3) gives 1553 as the first occurrence of the term meaning
                terrestrial globe. Anders (1904, p. 261): Up to the date of 1592
                    Mercator’s globes (1541 &amp; later) were in common use in England. In this
                    year, 1592, appeared [Emery] Molyneux’s globes said to be the first constructed
                    in England. Both globes show rhumb lines (see n. 919); illustrations appear in Stevenson (1921, 1:134, 192).
                    Baldwin (ed. 1928), who insists that Err.
                was written in 1589: The chronological indications then would be that
                    Shakespeare is referring to Mercator’s globe, but probably had his interest
                    captured by the work of Molyneux.

            find out Countries] Baldwin (1944, 1:360), quoting the curriculum at
                Westminster School, ca. 1630: [The seventh form students were] instructed out
                    of Hunter’s cosmographie, and practiced to describe and find out cities and
                    countries in the mappes.

                MS: S. Antipholus demanded in global order that S. Dromio find

                    of each of the countries bounding England, beginning with Ireland of course, and
                    proceeding clockwise to Scotland, France, Spain and her connections.

            In . . . Netherlands] Upton (1746; 1748, p. 146)
                thinks Sh. had the hint from Rabelais, where friar John is humourously
                    mapping, as it were, Panurge [in Gargantua and
                        Pantagruel, bk. 3, chap. 28], but there is no certain
                evidence that Sh. read Rabelais. Wilson (ed. 1922): The two passages were
                    probably written at very much the same time.
                Levin (ed.
                1965, p. xxxii): It is by no means a far-fetched gag, since it embodies—on a
                    more than miniature scale—the principal contrast of the play: on the one hand,
                    extensive voyaging; on the other, intensive domesticity.

                OED cites earliest use in about 1789, but Bog-house = privy, is dated 1666, and Boggard =
                privy, is dated 1552. The preference of Irish kerns (guerilla soldiers) for the
                protection of the bogs was remarked on; see Hadfield (1997) and Klein (1998,
                §5).

            barrennesse, hard . . . palme] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821): We
                    may learn, that this comedy was not revived after the accession of the Scottish
                    monarch to the English throne; otherwise it would probably have been struck out
                    by the Master of the Revels, as that relative to the Scotch lord was in the Merchant of Venice, [1.2.83 (267)]. In
                    MV, Q
                Scottish becomes F
                other; Err. was played at court on
                28 Dec. 1604, and perhaps a similar adjustment was made. Halliwell (ed. 1854): The
                    situation of barrenness is placed in the corner of the palm of the hand, the
                    furthest from the thumb and the nearest to the wrist, in a diagram given in
                    Saunder’s Physiognomie and Chiromancie, ed. 1671, p. 51.
                Thiselton-Dyer (1884, p. 490): In palmistry, a moist [hand]

                Wilson (ed.
                1922): The F. reading leaves hard without
                    point, while it is not particularly applicable to Scotland. But
                        barren-nesses is very Scotland, and refers aptly to the
                    callosities on the palm of a kitchen drudge, citing Ado 2.1.118 (525, dry
                    hand), and Ant.
                    1.2.52 (129, an oily palm). Idem (ed. 1962) substitutes for
                the beginning of the last sentence: But nesses is Scotch for
                    promontories.
                Tannenbaum
                (1932, p. 121): Hard in the palme (= hard-hearted in
                        the matter of the palm and having callosities in the
                        palm) expands the ideas implied in
                    barrennesse, . . . [meaning] also bareness,
                    i.e., without contents. . . .  The plural spoils the
                    witticism, such as it is.
                Kökeritz
                (1953, pp. 94–5): [Possibly] a pun on bareness
                    leanness, which is used by Shakespeare in I H4 4.2.77 [2446] (bare
                    lean appears in l. [2444]). The same
                    pun may occur in S[on]. 5.8.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) thinks emendation to barren-nesses unnecessary, but accepts the
                explanation; he cites Tilley (H86): A moist Hand

            France . . . heire] See . Theobald (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:295) regarding a possible pun on hair and heir: [There was the] stir about that time in France,
                    to exclude Navarre from the Crown; and . . . Queen Elizabeth sent forces in aid
                    of his cause. Here Theobald initiates a debate on whether this political
                pun should be heard in conjunction with another on syphilis. Upton (1746; 1748, p. 147):
                    An allusion to a certain stage of the distemper [syphilis], when it
                    breaks out in crusty scabs in the forehead and hairy scalp, making war against the hair, as Shakespeare says, by destroying
                        it; . . . armed and reverted, are terms borrowed
                    from heraldry; he cites, e.g., MND 1.4.99–100 (358–9). Johnson (ed. 1765), reading hair: An equivocal word must have senses applicable to
                    both the subjects to which it is applied. Both Forehead
                    and France might in some sort make war against their hair, but how did the forehead
                    make war against its heir? The sense which I have given
                    immediately occurred to me, and will, I believe, arise to every reader, who is
                    contented with the meaning that lies before him, without sending our conjecture
                    in search of refinements.
                Malone (ed.
                1790), on Johnson’s an equivocal word must have senses applicable to both the
                    subjects to which it is applied: Though a correct writer would
                    observe that rule, our author is very seldom scrupulous in this particular, the
                    terms which he uses in comparisons scarcely ever answering exactly on both
                    sides.
                Idem (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821): However, in the passage before us, the words armed and reverted precisely correspond with
                    the two images meant to be presented; so also does heir,
                    when spoken, from its similarity in sound to the hair of
                    the head. With respect to the principal remaining word, the poet, I imagine,
                    would say, I placed France in her forehead rather
                        than in any part of the body; for this single reason,—because it easily
                        admitted of the obvious and the covert allusion which I had in
                    view. The Clarkes (ed. 1864): Mistress Nell’s brazen
                    forehead seeming to push back her rough and rebellious hair, as France resisted
                    [Navarre].
                Ibid. on date: We, who have a
                    theory that this play was a very early-written production . . . think it
                    probable that this allusion may have been inserted afterwards, when the piece
                    came to be performed on the stage, possibly about the date when such an allusion
                    would be particularly popular, i.e., 1594.

            arm’d and reuerted] In addition to Upton’s explanation above in
                terms of syphilis are the following. Simpson (1870, p. 39): France was reverted,
                    or in reversion, because her crown descended to a new line on the proximate
                    extinction of the Valois.
                Baldwin
                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 6): In arguing for
                        reverted as the legal phrase, Simpson has overlooked the
                    primary fact that the legal phrase is reverted to, while Dromio’s
                    is reuerted . . . against.
                Idem
                (ed. 1928): A . . . contemporary instance of a woman whose forehead was
                    armed may have given Shakespeare the initial suggestion for his historical
                    pun. . . .  Under date [S.R. 28 Oct. 1588] we find . . . A miraculous

                        of 4 ynches longe.
                Idem (1947,
                p. 779) reproduces a woodcut showing the horn; the wording is slightly different
                from his transcription above. Foakes (ed. 1962): I do not believe that
                    Shakespeare is referring to this occurrence.
        


        914
            reuerted] White (ed. 1857): A misprint . . . for
                        revolted. The former word was very rarely used in
                    Shakespeare’s day, and then exclusively in its radical sense, to
                        return.
                Revolted = in rebellion is not attested, but is obviously
                correct. Cuningham (ed. 1907) compares Ham. 4.7.23 (3031) as the only other occurrence;
                quoting Lyly, Euphues (ed. Arber, 1868, p. 394), he thinks
                        Notwithstanding I will goe against the

                    in respect of hair.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962), agreeing with Johnson, n. 913–15: Turned back on itself, implying a receding forehead (and
                    loss of hair) (OED, ppl.

            chalkie Cliffes] F
                chalkle is a misprint. Wilson (ed. 1922): Her teeth,
                though Baldwin (ed. 1928): Cliffs = clifts = clefts = lips. . . .  More likely [than teeth
                    alone], Dromio is referring to Nell’s teeth within her lips. No one
                agrees with him. Delius (ed. 1858) cites 2H6 3.2.101 (1801); he also, in conjecturing
                    no whiteness in her, appears not to understand them as teeth. Sarrazin (1897, p. 100) thinks that this phrase, combined with
                others, shows that Sh., an inlander, must have become acquainted with
                the sea about 1590: A fresh seabreeze blows also elsewhere through the comedy (e.g.,
                    [1079]) and the poet knows how to
                put himself realistically into the busy life of a harbor town (Ger.). Craig (Gen.
                Ed., in Cuningham, ed. 1907): [We] should look for the chalky
                    cliffs in her cheeks; in correspondence . . . with the
                    other parts of Nell’s body; but, in them may well mean in
                        respect of them,
                    i.e. the chalky cliffs; no whiteness
                    having reference to her complexion which . . . was swart (line

        921
            hot . . . breth] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821): Perhaps the
                    allusion is to the fiery threats which Spain had recently used towards England,
                    when she sent out her invincible armada; or is the allusion merely to the heat
                    of her climate?
                Baldwin
                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 2) quotes Edward Halle, The Vnion of the two noble and illustrate famelies (1548, sig.
                    l3v) on Henry VIII’s brother Prince Arthur’s wedding
                night with Katherine of Aragon: He called for drynke [in the morning],
                        whiche he before tymes was not accustomed to do. At whiche thinge one of hys
                        chambrelaynes meruaylynge, requyred the cause of hys drouth. To whome he
                        aũswered merely saiyng, I haue thys nyght bene in the middest of Spayne,
                        whiche is a hote region, &amp; that iourney maketh me so drye, and if thou
                        haddest bene vnder that hote clymate, thou wouldest haue bene dryer then
                        I. Historically, Queen Elizabeth’s legitimacy depended upon that
                    jest, a fact which would be known certainly to Shakspere and to probably all his
                    audience. He means that Henry VIII’s divorce from Katherine was based on
                his belief that his brother’s marriage to her had been consummated, making Henry’s
                marriage to her incestuous, since marriage to a dead brother’s widow was forbidden.
                His marriage to Anne Bullen (Boleyn), Elizabeth’s mother, was legal only if the
                first marriage were annulled. Katherine always denied that consummation had
                occurred. Wells (ed. 1972): Referring to Spanish spices.
                Williams
                (1994, s.v. America): Clearly alludes to the Spanish pox, and the
                        ballast [926] is
                    required to stabilize a nose undermined by the disease.
        


        922
            America, the Indies] Knight (ed.
                1842): This is certainly one of the boldest anachronisms in
                    Shakspere.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): The only specific reference to America in Shakespeare’s writings;
                    here, like the Indies, named in reference to its proverbial
                    wealth.
                Williams
                (1994): America has an important place in Renaissance pox-lore as the
                    continent where syphilis was endemic and from whence it was introduced to
                    Europe. So, although the disfigurements listed in [923–4] might equally fit the
                    alcoholic, pox is clearly intended.
        


        923–4
            nose . . . Saphires] Baldwin (1959, p. 87) cites Greene and Lodge, A Looking Glasse for London and England, lines 214–17 (MSR):
                    His nose was in the highest degree of noses, it was a nose Autem glorificam, so set with Rubies
                    that after his death it should haue bin nailed in Copper-smiths hall for a
                    monument. See n. 65–72.
                    Main
                (1957, p. 232) says that comparing the noses of topers with jewels,
                especially rubies and carbuncles, was a commonplace, citing these lines; Nell,
                however, is not accused of being a drinker. West (1990, p. 7): Rubies, Carbuncles, Saphires could mean not only precious stones but also
                    pimple (OED, Ruby sb. 3; Carbuncle sb. 3b). On
                    Carbuncles and Saphires, she
                quotes Nicholas Udall’s tr. of the Apophthegms of Erasmus

        925–6
            who . . . nose] Kökeritz (1953, p. 98), rhyming Carracks-Carrots, mysteriously: Though OED does not record carrots in the sense of red or carroty
                        hair until about 1685, this must have been a popular connotation
                    when Shakespeare wrote the scene in which Dromio is finding out
                        countries about the fat kitchen wench.
                Cercignani
                (1981, p. 262) calls the rhyme unreliable. Dorsch (ed. 1988): Dromio pictures
                    armed fleets (armadas) of galleons or large merchant ships (carracks) taking on
                    ballast from her dripping nostrils.
        


        925–6
            Armadoes of Carrects] Fripp (1938, 1:300–1) recounts the capture of the
                Spanish carrack, the treasure ship Madre de
                    Dios in Sept. 1592: It inspired a passage in the
                        Comedy of Errors.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Fleets of galleons; armado was the usual early
                    form of the word [armada], which properly refers to ships
                    of war; a carrack (F’s Carrects was an alternative form of a word that was spelt in numerous
                    ways in English) was a large merchant-ship, a galleon, fitted also as a warship.
                    Shakespeare may have had the great Armada of 1588 in mind . . . , or possibly
                    the Great Carrack, the Madre de Dios, a huge Portuguese
                    galleon captured and brought to England in September 1592, citing
                G[eorge] B. Harrison, Elizabethan Journal (1955, pp.
                160–5). Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, p. 15):
                    The reference . . . is not specifically to the capture of one
                    carrack . . . as Fripp thinks, but to the Spanish armadoes of carracks to the
                    Indies . . . which Englishmen had longed for many a year to capture.

                    area which included Holland and the present Belgium (established in 1830), and
                    known as Low Germany; cf. 3H6,

            Diuiner] OED (1): One

                    sorcerer.
                Witch is not mentioned. Eds. have trouble glossing the word,
                offering soothsayer (Onions, 1911); magician (Foakes, ed.
                1962); witch, with powers of prophecy (Jorgensen, ed. 1964);
                    witch (Wells, ed. 1972); sorceress (Barton [in
                    Evans,
                ed. 1974]). Heath (1765, p. 199): Both which appellations [Diuiner, witch] . . . as she informed the speaker of all
                    his privy marks, suit her very properly.
                Capell

                        divining or guessing so rightly the speaker’s name
                    and his marks.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Not used elsewhere by Shakespeare. . . .  As Antipholus thought
                    Luciana might be a goddess or siren, so Dromio thinks of Nell as
                    diviner or witch.

            Wart . . . arme] Walsh &amp; Pool (1942, p.
                56), whimsically in an essay on left-handedness in Sh.: A wart is a repulsive
                    thing. . . .  It was never wanted by human kind. It is by many thought of as
                    something repulsive, something batrachian. Well do we know that the astute
                    author would never have found such a mark on the right arm of his devoted
                    Dromio. Had it been so we feel it never would have been brought to
                    light.
                Warren
                (1988, p. 44) thinks Sh. may already have known the anonymous Frederick of Jennen (3rd English ed. 1560), which he certainly used for
                    Cym. In it the heroine has on her left arm a
                    blacke wart (Bullough, 1975, 8:69).

            witch] Foakes (ed. 1962), see n. 929: Dromio runs from the kitchen-wench as a
                    witch in a comic reversal and parody of his master’s situation. Thus for both of
                    them Antipholus’s prejudice about the city as a place of witchcraft (see [264 ff.]) is steadily
                    confirmed. See n. 266.

                Dyce (ed.
                1864) calls Hanmer’s flint a highly probable
                    alteration.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907) quotes 3H6 2.1.201–2
                    (859–60): Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel, As thou
                    hast shown it flinty by thy deeds.
                Wilson (ed.

                    dog was originally the dog of an unqualified person, which, by the forest laws,
                    must have its tail cut short, partly as a mark and partly from a notion that the
                    tail of a dog is necessary to him in running. . . .  In later usage [it] means
                    either a common dog not meant for sport, or a dog that missed his game,
                citing Wiv. 2.1.110 (652);

                        myself, believing himself to be unknown in Ephesus, only to discover
                    that everyone claims acquaintance with him. He can explain this . . . only in
                    terms of witchcraft (l. [946]).

        948–54
            She . . . song] Foakes (ed. 1962): If Antipholus loses himself in
                    confusion of identities in Ephesus (see note to [941–2]), he also finds a new
                    identity in his love for Luciana (cf. I am thee, [855]), who yet tempts him to
                        self-wrong if she is a witch; hence the double image of her
                    here, full of sovereign grace, like a goddess, and at the same
                    time a mermaid; the word enchanting nicely links the two ways in
                    which he sees her (OED, Enchant
                        ppl.
                    a. 1).

                        [guilty to], but omitted to note them.
                Ibid. (1:61) cites WT 4.4.549–50 (2402–3): This is
                    one of those passages that should caution us not to disturb his text merely
                    because the language appears different from that now in use.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Guilty to the extent of, or perhaps simply guilty of.

                    entent they shoulde not heare the songs of the Sirenes. This information
                is not in Metamorphoses 14, where they are mentioned, and
                where Sh. probably got his information about Circe (see n. 1747), but rather in the Odyssey below. References to Homer do not explain where Sh. learned of
                the deafening; Cooper is a plausible source since Sh. turned to him so often. Foakes (ed.
                1962): As Ulysses stopped the ears of his crew with wax, so that they could
                    pass the sirens safely (Odyssey, Book XII).

                since Dromio deposited it at the Centaur, but this mistake does not strike the
                audience because nothing comes of the offer. He contrasts Plautus’s Messenio, who
                accepts all his gifts with pleasure, with S. Antipholus, who wants to pay for the
                necklace.

                            [974], in the sense
                    of silly, foolish, and doting, for any comic adventurer to refuse such
                        golden gifts.
                OED does not confirm dreams (OE metan means to dream); it cites 977 for v. 1: To come or

                    beyond the relationships of husband and wife, master and servant, into a wider
                    sphere. . . .  There is less rhyme, and less good humour, in this act than in
                    Acts II and III, as the sense of disorder, frustration, and witchcraft grows,
                    leading to outbreaks of violence and serious enmity in IV.iv
                especially.
        


        981
            Merchant] See . Foakes (ed. 1962) explains the Second
                    Merchant of Dyce (ed. 1857), etc., as one who has to ask (1467) how Antipholus of Ephesus is
                    esteem’d here in the city, unlike the Merchant of 1.2 who knows
                all about Ephesus. They may have been played by the same actor, and could
                    still be so played.

                    statement . . . without writ, warrant, or any process whatever. . . .  Justice
                    must be administered in a very primitive style, where one who claims that
                    another is indebted to him can call an officer and say, Here, officer,
                        this man owes me money; arrest him. Lawyers and courts would be
                    unneccesary, and no one could complain of the law’s delay where such a summary
                    method of procedure was permitted.
                White (1911,
                p. 191): At the time of Shakespeare . . . the law permitted the creditor to

                    We suggest . . . that Errors . . . was
                    arranged for something corresponding to a classical stage, with doors labelled:
                        The House of Antipholus,
                    The Street to the Bay,
                    The Courtesan,
                    The Priory, according to the mise-en-scène.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Probably, from the door marked by the sign of the Porcupine. . . . 
                    The direction may be an author’s literary S.D., but the staging . . . seems to
                    indicate the use of three doors or areas marked by signs representing the
                    courtesan’s house, Antipholus’s house, and the Priory.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): This is Shakespeare’s direction.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): This [SD] supports the conjecture that for this play there would have
                    been—at any rate when performed in halls—three separate houses from which entry
                    to the stage could be made.
        


        998
            ropes end] I.e., a piece cut from one end. Schmidt (1875, Rope):
                    For flogging (OED, sb. 1, citing 1297–8). Cuningham (ed. 1907, p. xxvii) compares
                Warner’s translation (1595): Methinks it is no pleasure to a man to be basted with a ropes end two or three hours
                    togither (see ). Cf. 1087, 1288, 1297,

        998
            bestow] Schmidt (1874, 2): Employ (OED, v. 5 and 5b).
                    Baldwin MS detects an ironic magnificence in it,
                leading to thousand pound (1003). OED (5) citations
                support that tone, e.g., Walton, Angler 1.39: Bestow
                    one day with me and my friends in hunting the Otter. Cf. LLL 5.2.663–4 (2619–20), Armado to the

        1003
            I . . . rope] Unexplained, as Wells (ed. 1972) says: Which is
                    particularly tiresome as the actor needs to make something of his exit-line. But
                    if spoken with conviction the line can raise an uncomprehending laugh.
                The interpretations are: 
                    (1) The rope, if properly applied on Adriana and her friends, is worth a
                        thousand pounds (outright or as an annuity): e.g. Rann (ed. 1786), Halliwell (ed. 1854), Delius (ed. 1858), Wells
                        (ed. 1972).
                    (2) Dromio fears that the rope will be used to beat him, sometimes taking
                        the first I as ironic Ay: Hudson
                        (ed. 1880); Kinnear (1883, p. 59); Joicey (1894, p. 43),

                            blows); Baldwin (ed. 1928, noting 247–9).
                    (3) Against pound = blows, Foakes (ed. 1962):
                            The point of the jest may simply lie in its reference to
                                bestow [see n. 998]; in buying a rope, Dromio buys the
                            equivalent of a large sum of money, and provides for
                                paying Adriana and her associates. . . . Cf. . . .

                            century.
                    (4) Cuningham (ed. 1907): Dromio must mean that
                            when he buys a rope (i.e. to hang himself with)
                            he buys the equivalent of a thousand a year, comparing Cym. 5.4.168

        1008–9
            our loue . . . not] Antipholus seems to mean that he thinks Angelo
                delayed bringing the chain to the Courtesan’s house lest it bind Antipholus in an
                improper relationship.

                    (OED, Chargeful a. 1; Fashion sb. 1, both citing this
                line).
        


        1013
            odde] Schmidt (1875, 10): Indefinitely exceeding any number

        1013
            Duckets] Foakes (ed. 1962): Gold coins of several European
                    countries were so called, though the original ducats were Italian, the first
                    gold ones Venetian. It is interesting that Shakespeare uses guilders in a
                    general sense for money ([12, 985]), and now switches to ducats for
                    a precise figure. Ducats remain the coinage for the rest of the play, except for
                    a passage of jesting on . . . angel [1203 ff.] (OED, Ducat 1). Fischer (1985): Like gilders
                (12), A general term for any coin or piece of money. Cf. 1094, 1266, 1279,

                Angelo owes 200 ducats.

        1017
            present] Onions (1911, adj. 1): (Of money) immediately
                    available, ready (OED, a. 5b, first citation 1600).
        


        1019
            Signior] Foakes (ed. 1962): Perhaps the Italian name Angelo made
                    Shakespeare think of Italy, change the play’s currency into ducats (l. [1013]), and use this form of address;
                    cf. l. [619], where Angelo is called
                        signior on his first appearance in the play.
                OED (Signor sb.
                    1b): A form of address, equivalent to sir,
                citing this line as the first occurrence as a vocative. See n. 619.
        


        1022
            I will] Abbott (§319), Franz (§611): I will, implying wish
                or desire, unlike I shall, implying simple futurity. The rigor of
                18th-c. usage leads Douce (in Steevens, ed. 1793) to call it a
                    Scoticism; Reed (in ibid.): And an Irishism too; Malone, an Irishman (in Boswell, ed.
                1821): And an ancient Anglicism, as appears by the present
                passage.
        


        1025–66
            No . . . apparantly] Foakes (ed. 1962): The strong emphasis on
                    mistiming here continues an element in the play’s action that began in [317 ff.], and was given prominence in
                    the mock-dialectic on time at [449
                    ff.]. Now the serious and public effects of mistiming in disorder begin to
                    emerge, as the Second Merchant and Angelo become involved with Antipholus, and
                    the last two are put under arrest.
        


        1025–6
            time enough] Foakes (ed. 1962): In time (OED, Time sb. 36).
        


        1032
            Both . . . Gentleman] Proverbial; see Tilley (T323): Time
                    and tide . . . tarries (stays for) no man.
        


        1032
            stayes] For the singular, see n. 14.
        


        1033
            too blame] OED (Blame v. 6): In the 16–17th c. the to was misunderstood as too, and
                        blame taken as adj. = blameworthy, culpable.
                Blake (1983,
                p. 101): The infinitive can be used in a passive sense . . . worthy
                        to be blamed.
        


        1034
            Lord,] It is not clear whether F means an exclamation or
                a term of address. The textual note
                lists only those eds. who use an exclamation mark. Foakes (ed. 1962), misattributing
                the exclamation to Rowe, who, however, prints Good Lord, just as
                    F does: This would be an odd form of address to Angelo;
                    the phrase is used elsewhere as an interjection by Shakespeare, cf. Shr., IV.v.2
                    [2297].
        


        1034
            dalliance] Halliwell (ed. 1854): That is, trifling. To
                        dallie, to trifle and toy with trifling words, Baret’s Alvearie,
                    1580 (OED 4, citing 1045).
        


        1035
            breach of promise] White (1911, p. 194): A breach of promise is
                    the violation or failure to perform some obligation, engagement or duty, assumed
                    by the party so failing. The words are not used in this verse in their technical
                    legal sense, but rather in the sense that a mere engagement upon which no legal
                    action could be maintained, was broken.

            Porpentine] See n. 777.

        1038
            steales] OED (v.1 11a):
                    Of . . . Time . . . To come or go unobserved, citing this line
                as the first occurrence, but citing Kyd, Spanish Tragedy
                (1592) as the next occurrence, dating Err. 1590, both dates
                perhaps erroneous.
        


        1042
            Either] See textual note.
                    Malone
                (in Boswell,
                ed. 1821), commenting on Pope’s metrical emendation and Steevens’s persevering in it,
                refers to Malone’s Essay on . . . Metre (in Boswell, ed. 1821, 1:561): Neither, either, whether, brother, rather . . . as
                    monosyllables. See Abbott §466. See n. 1009.
        


        1042
            send . . . token] Heath (1765, p. 199) and Rann (ed. 1786) conjecture
                    send by me some token.
                Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821): It was not Angelo’s meaning, as seems to have been supposed, that
                    Antipholus . . . should send a jewel or other token by
                        him, but that Antipholus should send him with a verbal token to his
                    wife, by which it might be ascertained that he came from Antipholus; and that
                    she might safely pay the price of the chain—[i.e.,] My master has sent me
                        to you for his cloth, and by the same token he dined
                        abroad yesterday.
                Singer (ed.
                1826), shifting from the idiomatic problem, asks Malone: Can it signify
                    whether the token Angelo wishes Antipholus to send by him
                    was to be verbal or material?
                        Tokens were common in Shakspeare’s time of many kinds. . . .  There
                    were written tokens or billes . . . given to men by which they might receive a
                        certaine sum of money, &amp;c. Such a one Angelo probably
                    requires.
        


        1043
            run . . . breath] Foakes (ed. 1962): I.e. jest too far.
                Proverbial; see Tilley (B641): He runs himself out of Breath,

        1069
            sirrah] Foakes (ed. 1962) notes the nice declension in
                how E. Antipholus addresses Angelo, from Good Signior (1019), through sir
                    (1029), and fellow (1063), to the
                    contemptuous

                    the bay or harbour, the other to the city or forum.

                Wells (ed.
                1972): It is . . . possible that Shakespeare wrote the irregular line, which
                    would not sound odd in the mouth of the breathless Dromio.

                belongings.
        


        1078
            Balsamum] Schmidt (1874): Balm (OED 1).
        


        1078
            Aqua-vitæ] Schmidt (1874): Ardent spirits (OED 1, 2). Wells (ed. 1972): These
                    details are oddly circumstantial. Perhaps the aqua-vitae is intended as a
                    consolation in case of sea-sickness.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): Were these two commodities regarded as specifics against sea-sickness,
                    or as aids to recovery from sea-sickness? Perhaps, with Oyle, luxury items bought by travelers.
        


        1079
            in her trim] Schmidt (1875, Trim subst.): Fully prepared for
                    sailing (OED, Trim sb. 1, citing this line as the first
                occurrence).
        


        1079
            merrie] Onions (1911, Merry 3): (Of a wind) Favourable
                    (OED, a.
                1).
        


        1080
            faire] Schmidt (1874, Fair adv. 4): Auspiciously,
                    fortunately (OED, adv. 6).
        


        1081
            Owner . . . selfe] Baldwin (ed. 1928): This line is
                    grammatically ambiguous. It may refer to three persons, the owner of the ship,
                    the master . . . , and Antipholus. Or master may be
                    direct address, and hence only two people mentioned. But if three people were
                    involved, we should have one cæsura after owner, and
                    another after master. Since this is contrary to
                    Shakespeare’s metrics, it appears that . . . master is
                    direct address. Later eds. remain uncertain. Cf. 1075.
        


        1081
            Master] Craig (Gen. Ed., in Cuningham, ed. 1907): The master of a ship was . . . an officer under the captain.
                        The master and his mate, writes [John]
                    Smith (Accidence for Young Seamen, 1626), is to
                        direct the course, command all the Saylors, for steering, trimming, and
                        sayling the ship. The Captaine’s charge is to command all, and tell the
                        Maister to what port he will go, or to what height
                    &lt;latitude&gt; (OED,
                        sb.1 2b, restricting
                the definition to a ship of war). Foakes (ed. 1962) agrees with Baldwin
                (see n. 1081 Owner . . . selfe),
                but: This word could refer to the master, the captain of the ship
                    (OED, sb.1 2a).
        


        1082
            Madman] Foakes (ed. 1962): Each character in his private world
                    of experience tends to see the others as mad, or to feel he is himself mad, like
                    Dromio at [869] or Antipholus at
                        [841].

            sheep . . . ship] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821) is the first to note that
                in Warwickshire the words are pronounced the same, citing TGV 1.1.73–4 (76–7). Stokes (1878, p. 20) adds LLL 2.1.219 (719–20): A
                    remarkable link between three nearly contemporary plays.
                Kökeritz
                (1953, p. 145) adds WT 3.3.112
                    (1550). Cercignani (1981, p. 150) calls the homophone
                    unreliable, believing that some puns, including this one, rely
                    on antithesis rather than identity; that is, the words are near,
                not exact, homophones.

            You . . . soone] Jorgensen (ed. 1964): I.e. you just as likely
                    sent me (for a rope’s end) to be hanged.
                Schmidt
                (1875, Soon 2): Likely; OED
                        (adv. 8c): Used to suggest denial of a
                    statement. This metrically short line has been treated three ways: (1)
                by making ropes a disyllable, (2) by adding
                    sir, (3) by letting it stand.
            
                (1) Malone (ed. 1790): The Saxon genitive case.
                    Steevens
                    (ed. 1793): A Saxon genitive case accords better with one of Puck’s
                        lyrical effusions, &lt;see Midsummer Nights Dream
                            [2.1.7 (378)]&gt; than with the vulgar pronunciation of Dromio.—I
                        suppose, a word has been casually omitted in the old copy, comparing
                        1076. Irving &amp; Marshall (ed. 1888): It would seem that the e mute was often pronounced in the old dramatists:
                            e.g. in Appius and Virginia (1575): A
                            virgin pure, a queen in life, Whose state may be deplored: For why the
                            queen of chaste life Is like to be
                            deflow’red.—Dodsley, vol. 4. p. 142. But Cuningham
                    (ed. 1907): It is mere foolishness to say . . . that the word is
                            pronounced as a dissyllable, or that the inflexion
                                -es was still often sounded in early
                            Elizabethan drama. The present genitive is toto cælo [entirely] different from the inflected genitive of A Midsummer-Night’s Dream,
                            II.i.7 [378], moonës sphere, or IV.i.107 [1614], nightës shade, which are
                        clearly reminiscences of Shakespeare’s reading in Chaucer.
                (2) Steevens (ed. 1793) adds sir.
                    Cuningham (ed. 1907): Sir has fallen
                        out . . . chiefly owing to its occurrence in the next line; and this is
                        confirmed by [1297–9].
                    Wilson
                    (ed. 1922) approves of Steevens’s emendation, but thinks that Cuningham’s
                    locating it after ropes end
                    seems better.
                    Foakes
                    (ed. 1962): The word seems necessary both to justify the metre and to
                        balance the next line; cf. 1297–9.
                (3) Wells (ed. 1972): Perhaps correctly, filled out to
                            read . . . sir. . . . But if it is taken as a muttered
                        protest some irregularity is effective.

                    Foakes
                (ed. 1962): The jest is that Dromio of Ephesus was sent to buy a rope’s
                    end.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Perhaps a halter. Not attested before 1821; it would be
                wasteful to hang servants.

        1093
            Turkish Tapistrie] Halliwell (ed. 1854): The old inventories
                    contain numerous notices of articles of furniture ornamented by Turkey work,
                    which seems to have been much esteemed.
                Macquoid
                    (Home, 1916, 2:128): This Turkey work was a
                    needlework imitation of an Eastern carpet . . . chiefly used for window seats,
                    bed valances, and chair cushions. It was a treble cross-stitch on canvas in
                    coloured wools, cut open to a close pile. . . .  [Quotes 1093.] As there was no such fabric made in Turkey
                    at that date, this undoubtedly refers to a small carpet of Turkey work.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Perhaps adding some local colour.

            Dowsabell] Halliwell (ed. 1854): Douce et
                        belle [gentle and beautiful], a favorite name for a rustic girl
                    (OED cites this line as the first occurrence in this
                spelling). Steevens (ed. 1778) finds the name in the Eighth Eclogue (130)
                of Michael Drayton’s Idea. Malone (in Boswell, ed.
                1821), assuming Steevens implies that Sh. found the name there, points out that
                    Idea was published in 1593, subsequently, I
                    think, to the production of this comedy.
                Rolfe (ed.
                1881): Applied to her ironically.

        1101–2
            Thither . . . fulfill] Gill (1930, p. 31): [Menaechmi] II.i.443–444. Messenio knows that masters must be
                    obeyed. (Warner has no corresponding language.)

        1103
            Enter . . . Luciana] Foakes (ed. 1962): The
                    dialogue here takes up directly from Luciana’s exit at [860], with a return to rhyme and patches of
                    stichomythia, which mark off with a poetic elevation the discussions of marital
                    relations between Adriana and Luciana, and Syr. Antipholus’s wooing of Luciana.
                    The tone changes on Dromio’s entry, but he speaks at first in regular verse
                    before modulating to tumbling verse and prose.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): The scene begins with a quatrain, the verse form employed in the
                    interview that Luciana is here reporting [787–839]. Foakes: [They] enter
                    presumably from their house, the Phoenix, i.e. from the centre door or
                        mansion; Dromio went off at [1102] as if he had some way to go to reach their
                    house, and returns at l. [1135].
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): [They] enter, we must assume, from their house, the Phoenix, on one
                    side of the stage. Many eds. label the scene Antipholus’s
                    house, which may mean inside it, entailing an unmarked stage door or
                temporary mansion.
        


        1105
            austeerely] See textual
                    note. Schmidt (1874, Austerely): Severely (OED, adv.). Capell (1774,
                p. 75): It [austeerely] has not the air of a printer’s
                    mistake; but rather of a word us’d at random, and without sufficient attention,
                    in the sense of—sincerely, or really.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): Adriana would not wish Luciana to gaze into Antipholus’ eye otherwise
                    than austerely, and she is evidently suspicious.
                Idem (ed.
                1962): [Surety,] a commercial term, leads on to
                        earnest (1106). Foakes (ed. 1962): Its suggestions of self-discipline
                    and abstinence tie this word to Luciana rather than to Antipholus, as [Wilson,
                    ed. 1922] notes; but it may be simply equivalent to in
                            earnest in the next line, and so apply to him as
                    well.

                For the apparent alexandrine, where the final foot contains two extra

            obseruation] Wells (ed. 1972): The following image shows that this
                    carries the technical sense of observing the heavens (OED, sb.
                6b).
        


        1109
            Oh,] Of
                F2. Collier (ed. 1842): The interjection O
                    is most frequently printed in the [first] folio Oh; and the [MS] f had perhaps been mistaken by the [F1]
                    compositor for an h, which was constantly written with a
                    tail below the line.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): An interesting misprint, which suggests that Shakespeare here, as
                    sometimes elsewhere, spelt of as a or
                        o. Whatever Compositor B saw, he construed the sense
                as an exclamation, marked by the comma. Foakes (ed. 1962): [Of] gives the final couplet . . . a flow which the verse pattern
                    seems to demand.
        


        1109
            Meteors . . . face] Warburton (ed. 1747): Alluding to those
                    meteors . . . which have the appearance of lines of armies meeting in the
                    shock, comparing 1H4
                    1.1.10–13 (14–17). Capell (1774, p. 75): A singular metaphor;
                    expressive of the flushings that joy brings into the face of a lover, in
                    discourse with his mistress. The meteors meant here, are not the same as those
                    in I H. 4. [above] but . . . the Aurora borealis; out of which, superstition has often
                    coin’d armies, and knights tilting in field, whereof they have some little
                    resemblance in their coruscations and dartings (OED 2b). Wilson (ed. 1922, Glossary): Any
                    aerial phenomenon [OED 1], e.g.
                    aurora borealis (cf. Rom.
                        3.5.15 [2044]
                    some meteor that the sun exhales). Antipholus’ heart, like the
                    unseen sun below the horizon, reveals its influence by swift changes of colour
                    and expression in the face.
                Heninger
                (1956, pp. 273–4): The term meteor included all
                    weather-phenomena—that is, all natural processes occurring in the region of Air
                    between the earth and the sphere of Fire. These meteors were thought to develop
                    from two sorts of evaporation drawn up from the earth’s surface by the sun: a
                    hot and dry exhalation potentially like Fire, and a warm and
                    moist vapour potentially like Water. . . .  The wording of [1199] was probably suggested by
                    Tamburlaine’s most flaunting boast: I will persist a terrour to the
                        world, Making the Meteors, that like armed men Are seene to march vpon the
                        towers of heauen, Run tilting round about the firmament (2 Tamburlaine, 3875–3878 [ed. 1973, 1:197]). But the
                    meaning clearly derives from the analogy between microcosm and macrocosm: facial
                    expressions are drawn up from the heart and displayed in the face just as
                    meteors are drawn up from the earth and displayed in the heavens.

                first figurative occurrence. Some eds., e.g., Greenblatt et al. (ed.
                1997), gloss as heavenly bodies, suggesting the modern meaning of
                meteor, a chunk of glowing matter.

                        He was a stranger here cannot be true because of the past
                    tense. Actually, however, he swore he is a stranger, is

                    although this has not been true so far, it certainly will be in the future; or
                    perhaps rather that he is certainly behaving like a stranger, though he is a
                    liar to claim that he is one.
                Bevington
                (ed. 1988): I.e., though he is not a stranger, soon he will be one.
                Bevington et al. (ed. 1992; 1997): I.e., though no
                    foreigner, he spoke true in the sense that he is a stranger to my heart and thus
                    false to his vows.

            a one . . . gone] On the near-rhyme or true rhyme with gone, Tannenbaum (1932, p. 122): If . . . in Shakespeare’s
                    day one was pronounced own, we ought to replace

                    long before the Shakespearean era. The probability is that both pronunciations
                    were current, citing John Stowe’s Survey of
                    London (ed. 1842, p. 69): Such an one.

                Barton (in
                    Evans,
                ed. 1974): I.e. that in seeing him other women would view him even less
                    favorably (so that he would not be attracted to them).
                Bevington
                (ed. 1988): I.e., and yet I wish other women found him in a less favorable
                    light. Eds. are divided between Foakes and Wells, who think that Adriana
                wishes that other women would not see his Stigmaticall
                deformity, and Barton and Bevington, who think that she wishes other women would
                find him ugly and so not be attracted to him (hence he would not reciprocate that
                attraction).
        


        1132
            yet] Wells (ed. 1972): Still (not

        1133
            Farre . . . away] Proverbial; see Tilley (L68): The
                    Lapwing cries most when farthest from her nest.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) summarizes the chief elements of repetitious commentary: The allusion
                    is to the bird’s [peewit’s] method of drawing intruders away from the nest; so
                    Adriana speaks Tongue far from heart, as Lucio glosses a similar
                    image at Meas, I.iv.33
                        [383]. . . .  Though the idea was common, Shakespeare may have drawn
                    the image from Lyly, who was fond of it, cf. Campaspe,
                    II.ii.9 [ed. 1902, 2:329], and Euphues and his England,
                    II.4, the Lappwing, . . . flyeth with a false cry farre from their
                        nestes.

        1136–9
            Here . . . fast] Cuningham (ed. 1907): The rushing and
                    irregular metre of these lines seems admirably designed to indicate the haste
                    and excitement of Dromio S., though he includes Adriana’s concluding
                line 1134 in his comment.

            sweet] See textual
                    notes. Collier (1853, p. 83): Dromio . . . would hardly
                    address the ladies so familiarly as to call them sweet.
                Halliwell (ed.
                1854): Sweet is here used rather in the idea of
                    supplication, than with the intention of any great familiarity. . . . 
                        Sweet now, and good now, &amp;c. were common
                    phrases (OED, a. and aj. 8b: In forms of
                    address . . . formerly . . . respectful or complimentary); sweet now appears only here and in Tmp. 4.1.124 (1788). Keightley (Expositor, 1867, p. 93): [Perhaps] mistress has been omitted after Sweet.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): Adriana was not S. Dromio’s mistress. But sweat
                        now suits the context well, while sweat and
                        sweet could both be spelt swete or
                        swet in the 16th cent. and the sp. swet =
                        sweat is found in Lucr. 396.
                Idem (ed.
                1962): A rather familiar way to address a lady. In 1922 I read sweat
                        now = hurry up. But this has no clear parallel in
                    Shakespeare.
                Sisson
                (1956, 1:93–4): Where the fastidious eighteenth century, steeped in
                    propriety, found no difficulty, [Wilson] emends to sweat now,
                        make haste, in the bondman Dromio’s words addressed to the lady
                    Luciana, on the ground that sweet now was too familiar.
                    But surely it is less improper to be familiar than to issue a coarsely rude
                    order in such words. Dromio is in a hurry and speaks hurriedly and naturally.
                    Feste calls Olivia sweet. READ: Here, go—the
                        desk, the purse—sweet now make haste.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962), accepting Wilson’s sweat: Dromio seems to be talking
                    half to himself.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Dromio in his haste speaks incoherently, either to himself,
                    remembering his instructions, or to Adriana, trying to convey the gist of his
                    message. . . .  [Noting Wilson’s sweat:] It seems no
                    less indecorous for him to tell them to sweat. If addressed to Adriana, sweet need mean no more than the terms of endearment
                    often addressed to their clients by bus conductors and shop assistants.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): Sweat accords well with the breathlessness induced in
                    him by running fast.

                    Luciana’s question means What’s the matter? Hast
                    thou . . . —Dromio, of course, answering as if the question had been
                    asked as to the manner in which he lost his
                    breath, quoting R. B. McKerrow’s MS notes for his proposed Oxford
                ed.
        


        1140–57
            Where . . . deske] Foakes (ed. 1962): As earlier (see [449–503] and
                    n.), Dromio in his foolery here and in the next scene, uses, or misuses, figures
                    of rhetoric, combining what Sir Thomas Wilson called Transmutation of a
                        word, or metonomy, with Transumption, which is
                        when by degrees wee goe to that, which is to be shewed
                        (Arte of Rhetorique, ed. Mair [1909], p. 175). It
                    has relevance to the action, for Dromio’s image of the Officer as a devil
                    ironically matches his real master’s growing sense of Ephesus as a place of
                    evil, and points forward to his treatment of the Courtesan as a fiend (see [1231–3, 1247]); at the same time, his words
                    relate to Antipholus of Ephesus, who is soon to be regarded by Adriana herself
                    as being possessed by a fiend, see [1398–9], and to be thrust into a real
                        limbo by Doctor Pinch.
        


        1141
            Tartar limbo] The two words are always glossed together, though
                commentators define them separately. Delius (ed. 1858): Tartarus, the underworld,
                strengthens limbo = the entrance to hell,
                hell . . . jokingly . . . here = imprisonment for debt (Ger.); (OED, Tartarus 2. sb.4; Tartar sb. 4, citing this
                    line; Limbo 2a). Root (1903, p. 65): The location of Tartarus within the
                    infernal regions is not specified by Shakespeare. The passage in Err., however,
                    shows that he knew it to be the worst part of hell. The ultimate source is Æn[eid], 6.548–627.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922, Glossary): Tartar is a common abbreviation for
                        Tartarus = hell (cf. Tw. Nt. 2.5.226 [1209] . . . ). The jest is that the
                    clown Dromio takes Tartar limbo to mean the hell of the Tartars
                    or Mohammedans, and so worse than the Christian hell.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): It also suggests the Tartars, notorious as savages, as the reference
                    to the flinty Tartar’s bosom,
                    All’s W., IV.iv.7 [2447],
                    indicates. . . .  [Noting Wilson’s explanation of the jest:] An audience would
                    have to be quick-witted to catch this.
        


        1141
            limbo] Cuningham (ed. 1907): Limbo or
                        Limbus patrum strictly meant
                    a place of confinement on the borders of hell, inhabited
                    by the souls of the pious who died A[nte] C[hristum] and of unbaptised infants, etc. . . .  Hence
                    the word was humorously applied to a prison (OED 1a, 2a, citing this line). Mutschmann &amp; Wentersdorf (1952, p. 250): The poet’s two references
                    to limbo [Tit. 3.1.149
                        (1293) and this one; there are two more] do not, it is true, reveal any
                    knowledge of the precise dogmatic significance of the term. He may have been
                    rather vague on the subject; but . . . the fact that he mentions it at all may
                    be regarded as another indication of the Catholic character of his upbringing in
                    respect of religion. Few are certain that Sh. had a Catholic
                upbringing.

            A . . . band] Campbell (1859, p. 39): Here we have a most
                    circumstantial and graphic account of an English arrest on mesne process &lt;before judgment&gt;, in an action on the case, for the price of a gold chain, by a
                    sheriff’s officer, or bum-bailiff, in his buff costume, and carrying his
                    prisoner to a sponging-house [where bailiffs held debtors]—a spectacle which
                    might often have been seen by an attorney’s clerk [i.e., Sh.].
                White (1911,
                pp. 194–5): By the terms back-friend and
                        shoulder-clapper, he means an officer who approaches from the
                    rear of the person arrested, and places him under arrest by clapping his hand
                    upon his shoulder and so advising him.
                Fuller
                (1862, pp. 10–11) jocularly remarks that literary men have some
                familiarity with the officers of the law, presenting them in a bad light, and Sh.’s
                passage in particular may have sprung in part from his deer-poaching
                    adventure, as he was actually pursued by the emissary of law, or pictured the
                    man in buff behind him in his flight to London.
                Hibbard
                (1981, p. 94): Shakespeare had the old morality plays very much in mind
                    [quoting these lines]. . . .  Beginning with a regular blank verse line, this
                    speech modulates briefly into heroic couplets [only 1144–5], and thence into
                    couplets of a very different kind as it moves to its climax: the evocation of
                    the morality scene in which the devil carries the soul of sinful man off to hell
                    on his back. It is a scene which goes back at least as far as The Castle of Perseverance ([ca.] 1402–25), where it is presented
                    in all seriousness, though not without a touch of humour.

                    a series of couplets do not rhyme.

            euerlasting] OED (sb. 3a): A material used in 16–17th c. for
                    the dress of sergeants and catchpoles, app. identical with DURANCE. [Err. is the first occurrence cited.] The word [in Err.] may possibly be adj . . . [which] app. identifies
                    the material of the everlasting garment with buff [1145], but it is not
                    clear whether this means buff leather or some woollen substitute for it.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907) misleadingly compares tawny coats of 1H6 1.3.47, 56 (414, 424) and 3.1.74 (1281), the dress of retainers, not officials.
                    Wilson
                (ed. 1922): It is important to notice that S. Dromio’s mind is full of images
                    from the old miracle and morality plays in this and the following scene.
                See Hibbard,
                n. 1142–61. Foakes (ed. 1962): The
                    word as adjective is, of course, appropriate to the devil. That is,
                until the end of time.

                attests to the form). See n. 1129–30.

                    Ant. 4.8.12 (2662). The
                definition probably makes the common emendation fury, with
                its considerable debate over the relative malevolence of fairies, unnecessary.

            Wolfe] Foakes (ed. 1962): Probably the phrase wolf of
                        hell (= fiend) is recalled here (OED 5a).

            buffe] Onions (1911): Stout leather made of ox-hide, used for
                    the attire of soldiers, and in Shakespeare, sergeants and bumbailiffs
                    (OED 2a, b, citing this line as the
                first occurrence). Cf. 1155. Hutson (1994,
                p. 207) believes buffe here and at 1155
                was lewdly associated with the vagina, referring to a suggestion by
                    Sanderson (1966–7, pp. 92–5) (and repeated by Ian Donaldson,
                    SQ 37 [1986], 100–1, using identical citations to Sir
                John Davies’s Epigram 8 and Bartholomew Fair 1.3.64–70)
                that it has that sense at 1H4
                    1.2.39–47. Recent eds. of 1H4 have not embraced
                the innuendo there, and it seems unlikely here. See n. 1142. Cf. 1155.
        


        1146
            back friend] Halliwell (ed. 1854): A secret enemy, Dromio playing on
                    the word, which alludes also to the sergeant’s mode of arrest.
                OED (Backfriend): Perh. orig. a
                    friend who kept back, and did not come forward to assist, and so
                    was no real friend.
                Backe friends occurs in AYL 3.2.158 (1356), where backe is,
                however, generally regarded as a command.

                (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols, 1817, 2:295): I remember you
                    proposed we should read here countermines; but, if you
                    please to observe, rhyme seems designed here by the Poet; and therefore I
                    suspect it should be commands.
                Capell
                (1774, p. 76) sees a pun on the Counter: A prison so call’d, and to another

                    (2440)]. . . .  But the word undoubtedly had also the meaning of a
                        narrow or winding passage penetrating the interior of any place and passing
                        out of sight; an out-of-the-way corner, quoting OED (sb.1 5a, citing this line) and its citation of
                Thomas Watson, Centurie of Love (1582), 95.131: A
                    Labyrinth is a place made full of turnings and creekes.

            narrow lands] See textual
                    note. Boswell (ed. 1821) first notes the uncorrected variant lans. Sh. uses narrow lane(s) in R2 5.3.8 (2504), 1H4 2.2.61 (793), Cym. 5.3.52 (2981), and d:e misprints are common (see, as always with
                reservations, Kellner, 1925, §§70, 74). Most eds. wish they could read lanes, but keep the full rhyme instead, and then try to
                account for lands. Lanes might be a
                near-rhyme with -mands. Singer (ed. 1826):
                    Shakspeare would have put lanes but for the sake
                    of the rhyme.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1793): What we now call landing-places at the
                    water-side.
                Henley (in
                    ibid.): As a creek is a narrow water, forming an inlet from the main
                    body into the neighboring shore, so a narrow-land is an
                    outlet or tongue of the shore that runs into the water.—Besides, narrow Lanes and Alleys are
                    synonymous.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): Shakespeare’s thoughts here may have been running on the
                        alleys of old London [cf. R2 2504 (5.3.8)], such as Rose Alley, Horseshoe
                    Alley, etc., leading down to the river on either side, and the
                        creeks and landings that would naturally be sought by debtors
                    and others seeking to escape across the river by water to one of the
                        liberties. The word land, whatever its exact
                    use here, may be a reminiscence of Stratford husbandry, and refer to the strip,
                        ridge, or land which contained about one-third
                    of an acre, and formed part of a yard-land, itself a division of
                    the arable common fields of Stratford. (See [Charles I.] Elton’s William Shakespeare, his Family, etc., 1904.) Laund is the form used by Chaucer and Dryden. Coles in
                    his Eng. Dict. 1696 gives the meaning, plain
                        untilled ground in a park.
                OED (Land) does not attest a variant
                spelling launds but enters it as a separate word. Wells (ed.
                1972) compares the hunting metaphor of 3H6 3.1.2 (1399): For through this Laund anon the Deere
                    will come.

            runs Counter] Theobald (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:295): What is meant . . . of hounds running
                        counter, and drawing the [sic] foot, I am too raw a sportsman to guess at.
                Johnson (ed.
                1765): To run backward, by mistaking the course of the
                    animal pursued. . . .  The jest consists in the ambiguity of the word counter, which means the wrong way in
                        the chase, and a prison in London. The officer
                    that arrested him was a serjeant of the counter [an
                    officer of that prison]. For the congruity of this jest with the Scene of the
                    action [i.e., Ephesus], let our Authour answer. See OED (Counter adv. 1)
                for run counter; (sb.3 7) for the prison. See n. 1146.

                        matter and case as a distinction between
                        content and form.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): An obscure, possibly strained, legal pun seems likely; perhaps the
                    second matter plays on the word as a subject of dispute
                    formulated in a case (OED, sb. 16b: In Law. Something which is to be tried or proved; statements
                    or allegations which come under the consideration of the court, always

                Malone (ed.
                1790): Dromio, I believe, is still quibbling. His master’s case was touched by the shoulder-clapper [1207].

                        case which could not be met by the old fixed forms. Actions commenced by
                        these new writs became known as actions of trespass on the
                            case (or, shortly, actions on the case) because
                        the special facts of each case were stated in a writ framed as near as

                    pronoun being formerly a common usage, citing The Jew
                    of Malta 3.5.11 (ed. 1973, 1:305): Shalt have no tribute here: i.e. thou
                        shalt, etc. See Abbott §400: The omission of the Nominative
                    is most common with has,
                    is,
                    was.

            Mistris redemption] Clark &amp; Wright (ed.
                1863): Rowe, by his punctuation and capital R, made Dromio call Luciana
                        Redemption. [See textual note (redemption); F4
                    has the capital R.] Pope and Theobald seem to have
                    followed him, though they give the small r. The Folios cannot be made chargeable
                    with this error, for the comma does not regularly follow vocatives in these
                    editions where we expect it. There is no comma, for instance,
                        following . . . Mistress in [1262] or in [1325].
                Wilson (ed.

                    into the atmosphere of the morality plays. . . .  It must be remembered that
                    Adriana was a stranger to S. Dromio.

            Thus] Tannenbaum (1932, p. 106) points out that in Elizabethan
                handwriting a might be misread as u,
                    t as s, hence
                        Thus for That. For corroboration, he

            band] See textual note 1161,
                    1162. Steevens (ed. 1773), rejecting bond: An
                    obligatory writing to pay a sum of money. . . .  A band
                    is likewise a neckcloth. On this circumstance I believe
                    the humour of the passage turns (OED, Bond sb.1
                    9a; Band sb.2 4a). Ritson (1783,
                pp. 26–7): [Steevens] is under a double mistake. A band is not, nor ever was, a neckcloth, though,
                    certainly, an appendage to the neck. Neither does the humour of the passage turn
                    upon any such allusion; for there would be very little humour in it, if it did.
                    Adriana means a written band, and Dromio quibbles upon a
                        hempen one.
                Rann (ed.
                1786) accepts hempen, a halter.
                Malone (ed.
                1790): See Minsheu’s Dict[ionary], 1617, in v. BAND or
                        Obligation. In the same column is found—A BAND or thong to
                        tie withal. Also—A BAND for the neck, because it serves to
                            bind about the neck. These sufficiently
                    explain the equivoque.
                Raleigh
                (1916, 1:25–7) amusingly describes the Rise, Progress, Decline, and Fall of
                    the Ruff: The original of the ruff was the band, or falling-band,
                    a wide embroidered collar of linen or cambric, worn round the neck (p.
                25). Wilson
                (ed. 1922, Glossary): A leash to tie up a dog (v. N.E.D. sb.1 5), hence the quibble on a chain
                        [1163].
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) sees band connecting with chaine
                which would have been worn round the neck; he sees no point to
                Wilson’s leash. Cf. 1213–14.

            ring] Shirley (1963, p. 108): The quick wit of the Syracusan

                    clock.

                    mistiming which is such a prominent element in the play; cf. [1025–6] and [his]

            houre] White (ed. 1857): Hour and
                        whore were both of old pronounced hoor,—the word originally having been hure,
                    Anglo-Saxon. He is contradicted by OED (Hour): The h became mute in Romanic, and though
                    since written in F., Sp., and Eng. has never been pronounced.
                Kökeritz
                (1943, p. 361) proposes the same pun, comparing AYL 2.7.26 (999), rejected by Cercignani (1981, p. 194) as
                    unreliable as well as phonologically inconclusive.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): A pun on whore has been suggested, but one on
                        ower would make better sense. Since the pun on
                    whore depends on a = she, the fact that it
                ceased being a feminine pronoun after 1450 makes Wells’s ower
                persuasive save that the first example meaning debtor is 1637 (OED, pron. 2).

            owes . . . season] The phrase is not satisfactorily explained. Theobald
                (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols, 1817, 2:296) on Pope’s
                omission of to season: It is evident from the
                    subsequent passages that rhyme was here intended by the Poet. Here is an
                    assertion that Time owes more than he is worth, yet no explanation in what
                    respect. I only quote this instance, to the praise of our Editor [Pope]; for in
                    the first folio edition, we have both the rhyme and the
                    reason, quoting the lines. Delius (ed. 1858): To
                    season goes with owes more. Time, considered in the
                abstract and general, owes to the particular, actual moment more than he can pay
                (Ger.). Schmidt (1875, Season subst. 3): Fit and convenient
                    time. . . .  [Time] is seldom so convenient and opportune as one could
                        wish, hence = opportunity. Kökeritz (1953, p. 144)
                rhyming Season-Seisin: [Dromio]
                    is probably quibbling on seisin
                    to confiscate.
                Seisin is pronounced season, which
                however rhymes with Reason (perhaps = raisin) here and at
                    443. Cercignani (1981, p. 262)
                calls Kökeritz’s rhyme unreliable.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Possibly A term or session of court . . .  (O.E.D., sb. 7) . . . seizing, cf.
                        stealing, l. [1175] seems a better possibility.
                Salgādo
                (1972, p. 89): [Possibly] time has so exhausted itself that it’s more trouble
                    than it’s worth to set it straight (season neatly combining the
                    two usual senses of bring to maturity and make palatable
                        or agreeable). Alternatively, if we are not too snobbish to credit
                    the lower orders with quasi-metaphysical intuitions, S. Dromio may be saying
                    that time in itself is empty and owes all its powers and more to
                        season, the harmonious cyclical regularity of the natural
                    world.
                Wells (ed.
                1972) thinks neither seisin nor seizing makes a good joke: Perhaps there is a double pun on Time/thyme and season as season (of the year) and seasoning [quoting Salgādo].
                Slights
                (1986, p. 24): Dromio is making a distinction between time as
                    a natural phenomenon beyond human control, and good time or
                        season which refers to the human organization of time for
                    certain purposes. . . .  He is not denying time’s importance but insisting that
                    its significance derives from artificial human arrangements—in this case his
                    master’s apparent arrest and the law that requires any Syracusian caught in
                    Ephesus to pay a heavy fine or forfeit his life. Time . . . is bankrupt because
                    it is indebted to season (i.e. the occasions appointed by people for certain
                    purposes) for more worth or value than it intrinsically has.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988) thinks Kökeritz’s seisin
                very likely in view of the many law terms in Err.

                Foakes (ed.

                        If time is in debt, and also a thief, and meets a sergeant, hasn’t he
                        good reason to retreat to the extent of an hour in a

                    description of the Officer ([1141
                    ff.]) in speaking now to Antipholus. But the theme of his foolery, the devil,
                    points up an increasing sense of confusion, witchcraft, and evil in the main
                    action, as by the end of this scene his master believes in earnest what Dromio
                    had said in jest.

                OED, sb.2 confirms the noun usage; Sh. uses the word

            what . . . apparel’d] The passage has not been satisfactorily explained.
                Dromio is surprised to see his master free from the sergeant who arrested him in 4.1
                    (1067). The first attempts to
                explain the line depend on emendation (see textual note 1197), the second on explaining puns. Theobald
                (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols, 1817, 2:296) on of
                    old Adam, i.e., of the now-missing bailiff: Adam, you know, went
                    naked; which the vulgar call, in his buff. The bailiffs
                    went array’d formerly in coats of buff: so that this additional buff, I presume,
                    he means by the new apparel of Adam.
                Theobald
                (ed. 1733): But why is the Officer call’d old Adam new apparell’d? The
                    Allusion is to Adam in his State of Innocence going
                    naked; and immediately after the Fall, being cloath’d in a Frock of Skins. Thus he was new-apparell’d: and in like manner the
                        Sergeants of the Counter were
                    formerly clad in Buff, or Calves-Skin, as the Author humourously a little lower calls it [1202].
                Singer (ed.
                1826): Dromio asks Antipholus if he had got him new apparell’d, i.e. got him a new suit, in other words got rid of him.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922) objects that get rid of was not idiomatic until 1665. Cuningham
                (ed. 1933, p. vii): Quit is the natural expression of
                    one who has brought money for this purpose. Compare [26].
                Weld (1956,
                pp. 454–6) considers the meaning of new apparel’d: Can
                    it, as it must in Theobald’s reading . . . refer to the skins with which God
                    clothed Adam and Eve after the Fall [Gen. 3:21]? If so,
                    [it] means the sergeant, who in his leather coat is the picture of Adam
                        in his new skins. Then, somehow, in Theobald’s fashion or another,
                    we must emend the line to get rid of Adam. . . .  [But this]
                    reading is at odds with common understanding of the Bible. From Patristic times,
                    commentators agree that the skins symbolize the condition of fallen, or the
                        old man. As such, they point a contrast with the New Adam,
                    Christ—the wedding garment clothing the redeemed. On the one
                        hand . . . It pleased God to cloath man . . . to put him in minde
                        of mortalitie, by his cloathing of dead beasts skinnes [Andrew Willet,
                            Hexapla in Genesin, London, 1608, pp.
                        54–5]. . . . On the other hand stands the Apostolic injunction to
                    put off the old man and put on the new [Eph. 4:22–4;
                    see ]. . . .  The contrast . . . is that between the unregenerate part of our
                    nature, symbolically dressed in the old halter and badge of our desert to die,
                    and the new garment which defends us from death, hell, and damnation. To speak
                    of old Adam as newly dressed in the symbol of the fact that he is not the New Adam, but the Old, would require of the
                    audience a most peculiar erudition. Weld summarizes the virtual
                    morality play . . . the whole action of Antipholus’ arrest into the terms of
                    bondage to sin, damnation, and redemption [proposed by Wilson, ed. 1922, at 1142]. . . .  The dramatic treatment
                    of the whole episode in these two scenes . . . is an elaborate play upon the
                    moral analogy of man contending with the world, the flesh, and the devil. Within
                    this moral analogy the line must shape its meaning. A partial sense, at least,
                    may be caught in the wretched clumsiness of paraphrase: What, have you
                        got the sergeant, who in his leather coat symbolized your unregenerate
                        nature, new clothed as liberator?
                Wells &amp; Taylor (1987, p. 268): [Alice] Walker noted
                    that One would expect a punning allusion to redemption
                            [1156] . . . as a link
                        between the gold for which he has been sent and the following old
                            Adam. Walker took up McKerrow’s work on the
                proposed Oxford ed.

            picture] Douce (1807, 1:367): Here seems to be an allusion to
                    some well-known contemporary painting, perhaps of a sign. . . .  Similar
                    instances had before occurred in the picture of we three,
                    and Mistress Mall in TN 2.3.17 (717) and 1.3.127 (235). Possibly he is right; see n. 1200. Perring (1885, pp. 81–2), on the analogy that augury was sometimes spelled augure,
                thinks that picture is a misprint for victure, i.e., victory, but does not explain what the
                victory might be.

                Golden Age, Metamorphoses bk. 1.89–112, but this seems
                far-fetched.

            the Paradise] Eaton (1858, p. 173) notes that the word does not appear in
                the Old Testament, though it does in 2 [4] Esd. 3:6, 6:2,
                    7:53. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, p. 302)
                points out that Paradise appears in the Bishops’ Bible
                glosses and map labels for Gen. 1–2 (F 1568, Q 1569), but
                not in Geneva. Wells (ed. 1972): The definite article suggests a
                    topical allusion to an inn or something of the kind kept by a man called Adam;
                    but this is unverifiable.
                Milward
                (1973, p. 33) thinks the vivid and popular manner of this and other
                biblical references here and elsewhere in Sh. may point to the influence of the
                mystery plays.

                        living] to the sergeant dressed in his leather coat, who lies in
                    wait for the spendthrift, to arrest him. The jest depends on the contrast
                    between the father and the sergeant.

            forsake your libertie] Wilson (ed. 1922): S. Dromio’s mind still

                    your soul to the devil. See n. 1142 (euerlasting). Foakes (ed.
                1962) compares 2 Cor. 3:17: Where the spirit of the
                    Lord is, there is liberty.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Various levels of punning are possible: give up your
                        freedom; leave your domain; cease your wrong
                        behaviour; even sell your soul.

            case . . . leather] Cuningham (ed. 1907): The quibble here is

                    (Bullen, iii.109 &lt;Scene, The Compter&gt;: My case, Master Bramble, is stone walls and iron
                    gates.). In his introduction Cuningham (p. xxvii) compares
                Warner’s 1595 translation: You had bene in good case, if I had not bene heere
                    now (see ).

                    Bass-viol, citing this line as the first occurrence). Foakes (ed.
                1962): The word bass carries also the meaning
                        base, and is so spelled in F.
                Perhaps Viole = vile.

            sob] See textual note.
                    OED (sb.
                1c): An act, on the part of a horse, of recovering its wind after
                    exertion; an opportunity allowed to it of doing this; hence fig., a rest or respite, citing Err.
                as the first occurrence (dating Err. 1590), and Gervase
                Markham, A discorse on horsemanshippe (1593). The word was
                unfamiliar by Rowe’s time, leading to considerable guessing. Capell (1774,
                p. 76) on Rowe’s emendation: What is giving a
                    fob . . . ? Fob, at this time of day, means—a
                    put-off, a delay accompany’d with slight; a sense not corresponding with any
                    thing in the passage in question: [Hanmer, ed. 1744] has—bob; meaning, probably,—tap on the shoulder; for bob is a stroke, though not of that sort: but fob may as well have that sense put upon it, as take the
                    other in one so constrain’d.
                Dyce (1844,
                p. 29): As Mr. Collier retained sob, he
                    ought to have explained what it means in this passage.
                Idem (ed.
                1857): Mr. Halliwell, in his Dict. of Arch. and Prov.
                        Words gives Sob—To sop, or suck up.
                            Suffolk; and adds, Perhaps sob in the old copies of the Comedy
                            of Errors means sop.—It may be
                    that the former is a misprint for the latter.
                White (ed.
                1857), reading stop: In all modern editions hitherto,
                    except Mr. Collier’s, who retains sob, it has been changed to
                            fob! a word
                    equally devoid of any shade of meaning here. For how does an officer give men a
                        fob? and could giving a man a fob rest or arrest him? giving him a stop would
                    do both. Eds. who find themselves unhappy with these terms and their
                definitions are Hudson (ed. 1880); Irving &amp; Marshall
                (ed. 1888); and Cuningham (ed. 1907), who cites, for bob,
                R3 5.3.334 (3804), MND 2.1.49 (420), Lyly’s
                    Campaspe 3.2.39–40 and Mother
                    Bombie 2.1.100 [ed. 1902, 2:335, 3:186]. He also cites OED, Bob, but not Sob, no
                doubt because that fascicle of OED was not published until
                1913. Foakes
                (ed. 1962), citing OED, sb. 1c, continues: The quibble on the usual sense of the
                    word is continued in rests (arrests) [1208] and takes pity [1209].

                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 25), dating Err. in 1589, quotes from A Knack to Know a

                    ere I was weary, against my will; he said it was upon your suit, and yet he laid
                    his hands on me; nay, more, on my shoulder (in Hazlitt, 1874–6, 6:547).
                Baldwin continues: The pun of being rested before weary is an evident
                    adaptation of . . . the man sir, that when gentlemen are tired giues
                        them a sob, and rests them . . . , though the editor of Knacke missed the allusion and annotated (wary,
                        aware). See n. 1151 and .
        


        1209
            decaied] Kittredge &amp; Ribner (ed. 1966):
                    Financially ruined (OED,
                    Decay v. 1b).
        


        1210–11
            sets . . . Pike] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821): In a metaphorical
                    sense, to be firmly resolved (OED, Rest sb.2
                    7c): To have or take a resolution; to be resolved or
                    determined, citing Err. as the first
                occurrence. The phrase occasioned much defining as the puns were uncovered. Modern
                eds. use some combination of the following.
            On the first sense: Seymour (1805, 2:421): To make up or compose his mind
                    to a fixed resolution [citing Rom. 5.3.109–10 (2966–7)]. But here is further
                    meant,—eternal repose.
            OED (sb.1 11a): A support for a fire-arm,
                    employed in steadying the barrel to ensure accuracy of aim, first
                citation 1590. Warburton (ed. 1747): A phrase taken from military
                    exercise. . . .  Till the middle of the last century, the musketeers always
                    supported their pieces when they gave fire, with a Rest
                    stuck before them into the ground, which they called setting
                        up their Rest, and is here alluded to.
            OED (sb.2 6a): In primero, the stakes kept in
                    reserve, which were agreed upon at the beginning of the game, and upon the loss
                    of which the game terminated; the venture of such stakes citing H5 2.1.16 (520), but not Err.
                Malone (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821): In most instances, as Mr. Reed [ed. 1813] has justly observed, (in
                    a note on Romeo and
                            Juliet, Act V. Sc. III. [109–10, 2966–7]) it has a
                    reference to the game of Primero.
            OED (sb.2 7a: To set (up) one’s
                            rest): To stake, hazard, or venture one’s all
                        on or upon something.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): Stakes his all upon an event; is absolutely determined on some
                    course of action; of course with a quibble on ’rest or
                        arrest. . . . But the usual modern explanation of the term
                    is that it is a metaphor borrowed from the card game of primero. And Shakespeare
                    may also hint at the sense of stay or
                    halt.
        


        1210
            suites of durance] Upton (1746; 1748, p. xxxvii): Gives them a
                    stone-doublet, i.e. puts them into prison (OED 3). Halliwell (ed. 1854): A play upon words,
                    durance being the name of a kind of strong stuff made with thread or
                    silk, citing 1H4
                    1.2.48–9 (155–6). Wilson (ed. 1922, Glossary, Durance):
                    Shakespeare seems to identify durance with
                        buff, quoting 1H4 above.
                    Linthicum (1936, pp. 74–5) discusses weaving patterns
                    (mountains, makerels, scallops, sillets) and price (two to seven
                shillings a yard).
        


        1211
            Mace] Upton (1746; 1748, p. xxxvii) first mentions that sergeants or
                bailiffs carried maces as symbols of authority.
        


        1211
            Moris Pike] Schmidt (1875, Morris-pike): A formidable weapon,
                    supposed to be of Moorish origin (so OED). The
                term caused much guessing, not recorded here.
        


        1213–14
            Serieant . . . Band] Baldwin (ed. 1928): Another quibble. The
                    officer is a sergeant of the band or bond; but there was a military officer
                    whose title was Sergeant of the Band (OED, Sergeant sb. 9).
                See n. 1161.

            rest] Foakes (ed. 1962): Continuing the play on the senses
                        repose and arrest, cf. ll. [1208, 1210] above.
        


        1218
            Is . . . ships puts] For the false concord, see n. 14. Foakes (ed. 1962) Here two
                    verbs are involved, is and puts,
                    and for the sake of the syntax, and here of euphony, it seems better to regard
                        ships as an error.

            Expedition, Delay] Halliwell (ed. 1854):
                    Although Dromio is speaking metaphorically, the probability is that the
                    name Expedition was known as applied to a vessel. [William] Lambarde, in his
                    Perambulation of Kent, 1596, mentions ships called Swiftsure, Antelope, and
                    Swallowe.
        


        1221
            Hoy] Schmidt (1874): A small vessel
                    (OED, sb.1: A small vessel . . . employed in
                    carrying passengers and goods, particularly in short distances on the
                    sea-coast). Laughton (1916, 1:155) describes the size
                    (considerable . . . carrying as much as 300 tons) and rigging
                    (a large spritsail for a mainsail, . . . a square topsail and a square
                    sail &lt;spritsail&gt; under the bowsprit . . . also . . . a square mainsail
                    when before the wind . . . and [occasionally] studding sails.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Jokingly named, especially since a hoy was
                    intended for fast sailing.
                Dorsch (ed.
                1988): A hoy was a small coasting vessel likely to
                        delay at many ports. These contradictions cannot be
                harmonized.
        


        1222
            angels] Warner (1768, p. 102): A piece of money, or gold coin,
                    with the figure of an angel stamp’d upon it, valued at ten shillings
                    (OED 6). Cuningham (ed. 1907) notes that
                    the dramatists frequently refer to it, citing Lyly, Gallathea 2.3.39–40, Midas 1.2.127,
                and Mother Bombie 5.3.42–5 [ed. 1902, 2:443, 3:123, 3:218].
                    Wilson
                (ed. 1922): Good angels this time, sent by Mistress Redemption,
                noting 1156. Idem (ed. 1962) withdraws the
                words after time.
                Noble (1935,
                p. 108) quotes Acts 12:11, the delivery of Peter from
                prison: That the Lorde hath sent his Angel, and hath deliuered me
                (see ). Foakes (ed. 1962):
                    Antipholus catches up the biblical echo in his call for providential
                    deliverance (from witchcraft), l. [1226], contrasting with his brother’s mundane need of deliverance
                    from arrest.
        


        1224
            distract] Schmidt (1874, part. b): Mad (OED, ppl.
                    a. 4). Wells &amp; Taylor (ed. 1986) emend to distraught without
                recording the change, a modernization (the etymology for the two words is the same)
                of a kind they do not record (Idem, 1987, p. 155). See n. 24.
        


        1225
            illusions] Bucknill (1860, p. 75): Illusion, as
                    applied to a deception of the senses, in which one thing is mistaken for
                    another, is strictly in accordance with its modern scientific use. Shakespeare,
                    however, does not use the words delusion and
                        hallucination by which the narrow sense of
                        illusion is now complemented (OED 4). Dorsch (ed. 1988): Compare [264–71], and
                    numerous other passages which demonstrate Antipholus’s feeling that he is in a
                    land of illusions and sorceries, and by now needing divine help.
        


        1227
            Enter a Curtizan] Wilson (ed. 1922): It
                    seems absolutely necessary that this lady should enter from a door marked
                        the house of the Courtesan, if the audience is to grasp who
                    she is.
                Baldwin
                MS on Wilson: How many could read?
                Wells (ed.
                1972) allows for either a door marked The Porpentine, or with
                    its sign. He notes that the dialogue does not establish her identity,
                adding, She should not, as in some modern productions, be portrayed as a
                    blatant prostitute. Note the irony of juxtaposing blessed power and the Courtesan’s entrance. See n. 777.
        


        1228–63
            Well . . . know] Gill (1930, p. 32): [Menaechmi] II.iii.357–382. Erotium accosts Menaechmus II for
                    Menaechmus I. IV.iii.685–695. V.v.906–908. Erotium is angry because Menaechmus I
                    asks for the cloak which she has given to his brother.
        


        1231–61
            Sathan . . . go] Foakes (ed. 1962): Antipholus has all along
                    been aware of Ephesus as a place of witchcraft and magic (see [264 ff.]), but his attitude to this
                    supernatural agency changes gradually through the play, as his pleasure in the
                    gentle enchantments of Luciana, and the genial magic which, as he thinks,
                    prompts everyone to greet him kindly, gives way to a growing sense of
                    frustration, of wandering in illusions. He comes to think more in terms of
                    sorcery, black magic, and finally, of evil, of the devil at work, as in his
                    bitter attack on the Courtesan here.
                Ibid. (p. 114) compares Eph. 6:11–17.
        


        1231
            Sathan auoide] Wordsworth (1864, p. 124), listing Sh.’s references to the
                devil: Devil as tempter.
                Carter
                (1905, p. 49) parallels Matt. 4:10, Rev. 12:9, 2 Cor. 11:14. Noble (1935, pp. 62, 279–80),
                on the spelling Sathan (here and 1232, 1338), finds it in Matt. 4:10 in Bishops’ (1568,
                    1569), and in the Gospel for the first Sunday in Lent (prayer books of
                Edward VI, 1549; Elizabeth, 1559), but in no other contemporary Bible printed before
                1595. He finds it in Matt. 4:10, Geneva Bible, Q1596 (but
                    Auoide Satã, ed. 1560); Foakes (ed. 1962) apparently cites the 1596
                edition in his note: Sathan avoid (Geneva version; the
                    Authorized Version [1611] has Get thee hence, Satan).

                Tilley does not cite this occurrence. Dent (1981), however, does cite D225. OED (Dam sb.2 2b): Applied opprobriously to a
                    woman.
                Dam need not mean mother, but any woman the devil uses; see

                    of the light of Lucifer, certainly present in the following use
                    of the word.

                    bordering . . . on profaneness. It is, by no means, consistent with our
                    author’s general sentiments in matters of a serious or religious
                nature.
        


        1236–7
            thereof . . . wench] Capell (1774, p. 77): This prophane and
                    nonsensical stuff could not come from Shakespeare, and ought to have been put
                    between hooks [quotation marks], the mark of rejection; the speech will not miss
                    it.

                    this close parallel in a contemporary passage of similar clowning fortifies the
                    emendation here, though as much to say (F) was a
                    normal construction.

            It . . . wenches] Proverbial; see Tilley (D231): The
                    Devil can transform himself into an angel of light.
                Eaton (1858,
                p. 174) compares 2 Cor. 11:14: For Satan himself is
                    transformed into an angel of light.
                Wordsworth
                (1864, pp. 124–5) explains the analogy: Women [light
                        wenches], whom the Devil instigates, while they act as tempters, and do
                    his work by the destruction which they bring upon body and soul.
                Noble (1935,
                p. 108): Notice the It is written in the manner of the
                    Gospels, citing Matt. 4:4, 6, 7; Luke 4:4, 8, 10. Sims (1966, p. 30): Shakespeare’s
                    practice, throughout his career, of making comic characters twist Biblical words
                    and phrases and shift Biblical concepts for a laugh is consonant with his love
                    for word-play, punning, and witty repartee. . . .  Dromio . . . uses a
                    Scriptural formula (It is written) and quotation to make an
                    off-color joke about venereal disease by way of a ludicrous syllogism whose
                    first premise is [2 Cor. 11:14].

                    Dromio is somewhat preoccupied with venereal infection, since he glances at it
                    again with the equivocal warning [quotes]; but jokes based on cooking, roasting
                    or accidental burning, and likening this to the burning sensations symptomatic
                    of gonorrhoea and urethritis, are an Elizabethan commonplace. . . .  Dromio’s
                    venereal jokes are in fact no more than the stock material of an Elizabethan
                    comic. See nn. 478–9,

                            away, or bespeak a long spoon.
                Wilson (ed.

                    obscure.

                    slang sense of spoon, which would be most appropriate to the
                    passage, seems to have been unknown in Shakespeare’s day.

                    Tannenbaum (1932, p. 120 n.), improbably: There is probably
                    also a pun on spawn meat (= aphrodisiac diet)—if indeed that be

                Mason (1785,

                        Satan and the devil:—surely, the right reading
                    is Avoid thee, fiend! I must add,—first, that thee is
                    preferable to thou, because it comes
                    nearer the old reading then; and secondly, that Avoid thee, fiend! is much more common than

                    All this supports the theory that the house should be readily identifiable on

                    note. Foakes (ed. 1962): These lines are usually printed as
                    verse, with a broken line at A nut, a cherry-stone, where editors
                    have suspected corruption or abridgement. It is true that the passage begins
                    with what might be two lines of verse, but cf. the opening of Dromio’s speech at
                    l. [1234] above, which is printed as
                    verse in F. I suspect that Shakespeare sometimes found it
                    difficult as he was writing to adjust from one rhythm to another, and that a
                    certain amount of overlapping, as here, is the result. Baldwin [ed. 1928 on 1255–6 below]
                    prefers to think that there was a crowded insertion on the manuscript,
                        part of which the printer missed.

                witchcraft. Witches collected loathsome items for their stews, as in Mac., or objects closely associated with their victims in
                order, by sympathetic magic, to harm them. Both cherrie-stone
                and rush, connoting trifles, suggest that Dromio is not
                especially worried. Reginald Scot’s Discovery of Witchcraft
                (1584), used elsewhere by Sh., which mocks the superstitions surrounding witchcraft,
                may help account for the lack of seriousness. More seriously, and illustrative of
                what devils say to witches and of what they want blood for, is the examination of
                Joan Prentice in Rosen (1969, p. 187): The devil has appeared to Prentice in
                the form of a ferret, asking for her soul. She responds, Her soul appertained
                    only unto Jesus Christ by whose precious blood-shedding it was bought and
                    purchased. To whom the said ferret replied . . . , I must then have some

                    more before this Comedy, and the English version of the Faustbuch (reprinted 1592) may also already have appeared.

                    text—until something better is proposed. Shakespeare, I think, does not use coll meaning embrace, etc., elsewhere. But he may have found the collocation in Erasmus, Praise of Folly, 1549, sig. B, 2 (quoted by Nares, s.v.): For els, what is it in young babes, that we
                        do kysse so, do colle so.

                    bottomlesse pit, and a great chaine in his hande. And he tooke the dragon, that
                    olde serpent, which is the deuill and Satanas, and he bound him a thousand
                    yeeres. But the quotation does not fit the circumstances here, where
                there is no question of the binding of Satan; perhaps, She is a she-devil who will
                shake her chain and frighten us. Bishop (1996, p. 82), noting a set of
                    references . . . to Biblical, and especially soteriological history:
                    When Dromio fears the devil Courtesan will shake her chain, and
                        fright us with it, it is the Devil of Revelation who is behind her,
                    and binding in a pit that is indeed at hand, adding to Carter’s

                    proud as a Peacock. The Clarkes (ed. 1864): A proverbial phrase, by
                    which Dromio rebukes the woman, whom he thinks a cheat, for accusing his master

                    sins, was often personified as a whore.
                Kittredge
                    &amp; Ribner (ed. 1966): Since the peacock
                    is proverbially the proudest of birds, it would be hypocrisy for her to warn
                    against pride.

            mad] Foakes (ed. 1962): There has been talk of madness
                    previously (cf. [336], [406], [840], etc.), but chiefly between master and servant
                    in jest, or in private conversation; it is part of a growing extension of
                    private misunderstanding into public disorder that the Courtesan should
                    seriously think Antipholus mad, and act on it (cf. l. [1278]).

                whether Sh. means to conduct oneself or to degrade
                    oneself, but OED (v.2): It has been
                    suggested that this [degrade] originated in a misconception of demean

                    disorder is reflected in violence, the beating of Dromio, the binding of Eph.
                    Antipholus, the entry of Syr. Antipholus and Dromio with drawn swords driving
                    the others off stage; the conflict of private worlds of experience leads to
                    public disorder. After Dromio’s last painful jesting in prose, the scene moves
                    into blank verse which becomes the medium throughout most of this scene and the
                    last act for the culmination of the serious plot, and its final

            Iailor] Collier (ed. 1842 on WT 2.2.4 [826]), noting that modern
                    editors of WT emend Jailor to keeper: They took a similar
                    liberty in the Comedy of Errors, where
                    the Jailor of the folios is converted into an

                Dyce (ed.
                1857): Mr. Collier does not perceive into what inconsistency he runs by
                    printing here a Jailor; for in the first scene of this act he
                    gives Enter a Merchant, Angelo, and an
                        Officer; and that the Officer who arrests Antipholus in that
                    scene is the very person who now enters with him, is proved by the speech of
                    Antipholus to the Duke (1691–1730).

                    will not easily believe the messenger’s account of my having been attached in
                    Ephesus. I should not have explained so easy a passage, but that it has been
                    misunderstood by an anonymous correspondent.
                Knight (ed.
                1842): As we print the passage, his wife will not lightly, easily, trust the
                    messenger with the money; for it will sound harshly in her ears that her husband
                    should be attached in Ephesus.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Editors frequently place a stop after messenger, but this is less satisfactory rhythmically; the sequence of

                        1285, 1286] in F offers no clear
                    guidance. Here trust means rely on the veracity of
                        (O.E.D. v. 4), cf. Shr., IV.ii.67 [1920]; she will not readily
                    believe a messenger who reports a thing so unlikely as his arrest.

                line). Cuningham (ed. 1907): This line certainly has little
                    meaning in the mouth of Dromio E. The Cambridge Editors somewhat ingeniously
                    suggest that it should be assigned to the officer [Jailor].
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): We may suppose that Dromio apes the obsequious manners of a shopman,

                    He means he is returning with the rope’s end for which he has been sent.
                    But his speech also means he is returning to a flogging, as indeed he

                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 294 n.; cf. pp. 166–7) remarks that
                Dromio is the biblical stubborn ass of Prov.
                    26:3: Vnto the horse belongeth a whip, to the asse a bridle: and a
                    rod to the fooles backe. He (pp. 293–4) discusses the doctrine of the
                soul; a human soul has understanding, but an animal only a vegetative and
                    partly sensitive soul. He quotes Nathaniel criticizing Dull, LLL 4.2.25–7 (1176–9):
                    He hath not eate paper as it were: he hath not drunke inck; . . . his
                    intellect is not replenished; . . . hee is only an annimall, only sensible in

                    dialogue between these two at [633
                    ff.], and cf. [595–7]. The sense of being transformed into an ass is part of a
                    thematic pattern relating to loss and change in identity, comparing with
                his n. [826–7].
        


        1310–20
            I . . . doore.] Vickers (1968, pp. 43–4): All the clowns in
                    the early plays are given such solos [of rhetorical symmetry], and one
                    linguistic device which is connected only with these early clowns is the
                    semi-naturalistic one of making their speeches begin and end with the more usual
                    comic matter of (non-symmetrical) puns and jokes. So the Dromio begins his
                    lament for being beaten with a pun, twisting his master’s indignant Thou
                        art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass: I am an
                        ass indeed; you may prove it by my long ears
                            (years)[], then launches an extremely balanced
                    antithetical account of his master’s zeal: [quotes 1313–15] which he ends with
                    another pun: nay . . . door. The extreme symmetry here gives to
                    the subject-matter a witty dimension which it might otherwise not have had, for
                    the exact return of the parallel antitheses in the style mimics the inevitable
                    nature of the beating—it is a stylistic mimesis of that form of humour in which
                    man is made to seem mechanical.
                Turner
                (1974, p. 181): The insistent rhythms . . . create an intensity that appears
                    to claim from us a response more intimate than detachment. . . .  Dromio’s
                    speech exaggerates the plight of the servant with a conscious exuberance to
                    generate by its very energy laughter in the audience. Still, it is hard not to
                    accept the possibility that the playwright aims at affecting more than our sense
                    of impropriety. In short, Dromio’s speech brings out the strong sense of
                    injustice from the point of view of the victim to implicate and slightly
                    discomfort us.

                p. 22): They [the Dromios] seem used to it [their beatings], and I don’t
                    intend to invoke later standards. It is a given of the play that the beating-up
                    of servants is funny, and so it is, if you take the Dromios as mere dramatic
                    fictions, two-dimensional cartoon figures. But once, a Dromio is given a longer
                    speech to mark his sense of things [quotes]. It is a disturbing reminder of the
                    human being behind the cartoon. Being sane in a mad world bears hard upon
                    servants, the shock absorbers of the social system. It is a glimpse, which this
                    play offers frequently, of the pain involved in farce. See n. 440.

            long eares] Theobald (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:296): How, by his long ears? All the tenor of
                    the following speech would make us rather believe, it was by his patient
                    bearing, or beating. (Is Theobald trying to find a suitable -ear or -eat alternative?) Steevens (ed.
                1793): He means, that his master had lengthened his ears by frequently
                    pulling them.
                Clark &amp; Wright (ed. 1863): The word
                        ears might probably be better printed as ’ears
                    for years; for a pun . . . seems to be indicated. . . .  A very
                    farfetched explanation has been offered by Steevens, and accepted by Delius and,
                    we believe, all modern editors, namely, that Antipholus has wrung Dromio’s ears
                    so often that they have attained a length like an ass’s.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922), accepting years, compares 2H4 1.2.218 (451). Sisson (1956, 1:95):
                    Read years, to make the jest clear and
                    unmistakable. To read ’ears is a half-way house. The
                    spelling years for ears was common
                    enough, and particularly so in the West Midlands. I have found yeating for eating, for example, more than once
                    in Warwickshire records. Donkey’s years is a very old joke,
                    meaning a long time.
                OED (Donkey 3b): Donkey’s or
                    donkeys’ years (occas. ears, with punning allusion to the
                    length of a donkey’s ears and to the vulgar pronunciation of ears as years) colloq.,
                    a very long time.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) cites Tilley (A355): An Ass is known by his long ears,
                though Tilley does not list Err.; Dent (1981) does list Err.

                    of Dromio bear a ludicrous, but probably accidental resemblance, to Cicero’s
                    celebrated encomium on literary studies: Pro
                        Archiâ Poetâ: Delectant
                        domi, non impediunt foris [In the home it (i.e., reading, studia) delights, in the world it

                    similes drawn from every sort and type of person, but as we should expect,
                    Shakespeare is particularly fond of the humblest and least
                respectable.

        1319–20
            begge with it] Foakes (ed. 1962): Perhaps alluding to the common
                    punishment of beggars and rogues by whipping, citing Whibley
                (1916, 2:489–91). But Dromio says that he will beg by means of whipping; perhaps with = as a result.
        


        1321–2
            Schoole-master, call’d Pinch] See , and n. 1330. Pinch, derived from the medicus of Menaechmi, is turned into a
                familiar folk figure, the schoolmaster–cunning man, whose Latin education permitted
                him to converse with ghosts and exorcise demons; he is also alleged to be one of
                Sh.’s pedants like Holofernes, but the similarities are few. Steevens (ed. 1778): In
                    many country villages the pedagogue is still a reputed conjurer.
                Singer (ed.
                1826): As learning was necessary for an exorcist, the schoolmaster was often
                    employed.
                Lloyd (in
                    Idem,
                ed. 1856, 2:82), writing about Sh.’s move from Plautus’s Epidamnus to Ephesus:
                    Another coincidence with the profession of Pinch as a schoolmaster at
                    Ephesus, [is] the mention in the passage of Acts referred to [19:9], of the
                        school of one Tyrannus (see ). Wilson (ed. 1922, Glossary, Conjurer) cites Ham. 1.1.42 (54). Greg (1942;
                1954, p. 140 n.): There is nothing in the text to suggest that he was a
                    schoolmaster. . . .  The insistence on his name and appearance . . . seems to
                    me quite pointless unless the audience were meant to recognize an actual
                    person. . . .  Was this another of Sincklo’s impersonations?
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) adds 2H6 4.2.84 ff. (2395
                    ff.): Jack Cade’s rebels condemn the Clerk of Chatham, a scholar and
                    school teacher, as a conjurer because he can read. Shakespeare
                    develops the figure of a comic pedant in Shr. and
                        L.L.L. (Holofernes); for the background to this
                    type of character [in commedia dell’arte], see K. M. Lea, Italian Popular Comedy, II.393ff., though Lea does not
                include Pinch in her discussion of the pedant. Foakes: So called because of
                    his hungry, lean fac’d look, cf. [1715 ff.].
                Baldwin
                    (Genetics, 1965, pp. 37–46) sees the satiric treatment
                of Pinch as being generated by anti-Catholic sentiment against the Jesuits, who
                claimed they converted or reconciled 4,000–5,000 souls in the 1580s on the basis of
                successful exorcisms. Baldwin draws chiefly on Samuel Harsnett, A
                    discouery of the fraudulent practices of [John] Darrel (1599) and A declaration of egregious popish impostures (1603), but notes
                that Harsnett describes activities in the 1580s as well as later. Wells (ed.
                1972): His title of Doctor alludes to his qualification as a schoolmaster,
                    not a physician.
                Milward
                (1973, p. 53) thinks that Sh. took the name from R. Phinch, whose anti-Papist The Knowledge [or] Appearance of the Church (1590) attacks
                conjurations; but ph = f. Could the
                actor have been made up to look like Doctor Faustus?

        1325
            respice . . . end] Consider your (life’s) end
                (finem). Foakes (ed. 1962) best summarizes the issues: Alluding to
                    two jokes of the time; one was the substitution of respice funem (a rope, i.e. hanging) for the common
                    tag respice finem (think on your
                    end), cf. Nashe’s attack on [Gabriel] Harvey in Four Letters
                        Confuted (1592; McKerrow, I. 268), to bee . . . bid Respice funem, looke backe to his
                        Fathers house (Harvey’s father was a ropemaker), and see Tilley, E
                    125, [Remember (Mark) the End]. The other relates to the habit of
                    teaching parrots to cry rope, and Shakespeare’s immediate source
                    was probably Lyly, cf. Midas, I.ii.45, she wil
                        crie walke knave, walke. Then I will mutter, a rope
                            for Parrat, a rope [ed. 1902, 3:120] (this occurs in a
                    passage which Shakespeare seems to echo earlier, . . . and Mother Bombie, III.iv.54 ff., where the parrot’s cry A
                        Rope is referred to in a context relating to hanging [ed. 1902,
                    3:201]. For further comment, and the probable source of the joke about the
                        rope’s end, see T. W. Baldwin [1948, pp. 141–55].
                Warburton
                (in Theobald, ed. 1733) suggests an allusion: To the last Words of
                    a famous satirical Pamphlet, wrote at that time [1570] by [George] Buchanan against the Lord of Liddington in Scotch, ending with these Latine
                    Words, Respice finem, respice funem. As for the Phrase, the Prophecy like the Parrot, We are to remember, the London tradesmen of that time were very fond of this new
                    exotic Bird, because he could speak. . . .  In teaching him the Lingua, ’twas no Wonder they should
                    delight themselves in giving him many knavish Words, as rope,
                        Scot. &amp;c. to the Offence of many of his Majesty’s Northern Subjects. . . .  However the Word Rope . . . was the most common Word in his Language; and, no doubt,
                    the most offensive. And the joke was this; when the Parrot had bespatter’d any
                    One with it, for the wise Owner to say to the offended Passenger, Sir, take care; my Parrot
                    prophesies. The pamphlet Warburton refers to without naming, Chamaeleon, was not printed until 1710 (see Buchanan,
                1892, pp. 37–53). Cuningham (ed. 1907) first identifies the quotations from
                Lyly: The phraseology of this passage is a clear indication of Shakespeare’s
                    early manner. He no doubt refers to [Lyly, as in Foakes above].
                Cuningham credits Craig (Gen. Ed.) for the quotation from Nashe’s Four Letters Confuted. Baldwin (1967, p. 11) finds
                    Finis and Funis in Lyly’s (anonymous) Marprelate tract Pappe with an Hatchet (1589), D4v:
                    Here I was writing Finis
                    and Funis and determined, to lay
                    it by.
                Lancashire
                (1969, pp. 237–41) proposes sexual puns on intercourse and penis in the passages
                from Midas and Mother Bombie cited
                above (walk = intercourse, rope =
                penis). She adds: For Elizabethans, it became a familiar pun to put the two
                    phrases together, as Shakespeare does [here], and thus to refer to the human
                    posterior, or end, and the end of a rope, with which men were
                    whipped. Beware your end, beware the rope’s end! . . . Here, then, we have the
                    association of rope, and rope’s end, with the buttocks; and the logical
                    extension of the pun to give it a sexual meaning is surely something the
                    quick-witted, pun-conscious Elizabethans would not have missed.
                    Shakespeare . . . probably means the pun to be sexual when he uses it in The Comedy of Errors. Dromio . . . has brought a rope’s
                    end with which Antipholus . . . intends to beat his wife; and the pun on her
                        end and whipping is clear; but implications of sexual
                    intercourse are probably also very much present.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): Dromio is ruefully warning Adriana of the use to which Antipholus
                    means to put the rope. He evidently means merely a whipping.
        


        1325–6
            rather the prophesie] See textual note 1326. Theobald (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:296): I do not at all understand either reading, i.e.,
                    F or Rowe. Capell (1774, p. 77): I.
                        e. or, rather, respect such a prophesy as parrots are often taught to
                    pronounce.
                Heath (1765,
                p. 200): The construction of these words is imperfect, the verb being
                    wanting. Mr. Warburton’s interpretation of them [see n. 1325], which I believe is right, would direct us to
                    read, or rather I’ll prophesy.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907) cites LLL 4.2.15–17
                    (1164–6) to support to prophesy: facere, as it
                        were, replication, or rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
                inclination.

                    (Genetics, 1965, p. 51) insists that Pinch is a

                    alleged conjuring physician, but also a

                    from Menaechmi, and are the elements there emphasized
                    by the philological bepuzzlements of Lambinus [whose edition of Plautus Baldwin
                    concludes Sh. consulted]. The wife had said, Viden’ tu illi oculos virere? vt viridis exoritur
                        color / Ex temporibus atque fronte, vt oculi scintillant, vide
                        [Do you see how green his eyes
                        are? And that greenish colour coming over his temples and forehead? How his
                        eyes glitter! look! (tr. Nixon, 1917, 2:449)]. W. W. rendered the
                    two lines of Plautus, Father, mark[e] I pray, how his eies sparkle, they
                        rowle in his head, his colour goes and comes, he lookes wildly. See,
                        see [see ]. W. W. translates
                    closely vt oculi scintillant, vide. . . . The
                    rolling eyes, however, are from an emendation referred to Camerarius by
                    Lambinus, oculos viere, hoc est, oculos flecti, ac distorqueri [eyes bend, twist, that is, bending,
                        rolling eyes]. The color coming and going and the looking wildly are
                    added conventional trapping. But Shakspere prefers the note of Lambinus
                who keeps virere (turns green),
                rendering it intelligemus
                    oculos . . . pallidos (we
                    understand pallid eyes), leading to Sh.’s pale . . . lookes (1381), pale not occurring in either Plautus or Warner.

            I . . . heauen] Wordsworth (1864, pp. 96–7) compares Acts 19:9, 19, and 13: Then certain of the vagabond
                    Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the
                    name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure thee by
                        Jesus whom Paul preacheth (see ). Carter (1905, p. 50) compares
                    Matt. 12:44, Mark 9:25, Jude 13 (To whome is reserued the blackenes of
                    darkenes for euer—Geneva), Matt. 17:21. Fuzier (1964,
                pp. 430–3): Sh. ridicules Pinch’s theory of possession and exorcism, with its
                treatment by binding and placing in a dark room, in favor of the Abbess’s humane
                treatment at 1571–4; this preference places Sh. among the most enlightened spirits of
                his time on the topic of madness and its cures (Fr.).

            coniure] Bellesort (1938), on the recent performing of Err. in Paris, notes a derision of Catholic practices that could not
                fail to amuse Sh.’s English public. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965,
                pp. 53–5) gives examples of Roman Catholic exorcism (which Protestants
                    condemned), but only as general background, emphasizing that Sh. depicts
                no specific instance of exorcism. Shakspere shows some knowledge of these
                    forms for exorcism, and he must have known something of what was being thought,
                    said, and done in the ’eighties; but his is a farcical use of that knowledge—no
                    other would have been permitted on his stage. The use that Shakspere makes of
                    his knowledge does not present exorcism in a favorable light. Rather, it is
                    presented in what might be called for England the official contemporary terms of
                    juggling, etc. See n. 656.

            Minion] Dorsch (ed. 1988): Normally = favourite,
                    but could be a sexual partner of either sex; here the sense
                        prostitute is implied by customers and
                        companions (used for disreputable company). See n.

            Customers] Schmidt (1874, Customer 1): Frequent visitor,

                this line). This meaning is not accepted by Malone (ed. 1790): Used in Othello [4.1.122 (2506)]
                    for a common woman [OED, sb. 4b], Here it seems to signify one who visits
                    such women; not attested. Singer (ed. 1826): A customer was a []familiar, an intimate, a customary haunter of
                            any place; as any of the old dictionaries [show]
                        under . . . consuetudo or custom, but he admits Malone’s definition. Dyce (1853,
                pp. 31–2) notices Malone’s as the only comment on the word, neglecting Singer’s:
                    And a surprising note it is. Your
                        customers means nothing more than—the people who frequent your

                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Antipholus speaks to his wife as if she were a courtesan; the irony is

            Din’d] Capell (1774, p. 78), speaking of emendations that ruin the

                        Hanmer, and Warburton, but Johnson as well] have put the
                    inserted word I after din’d, betraying thereby no small want of a
                    comic perception. Capell prints I din’d.
                Malone (ed.
                1790): I is not found in the old copy. It was inserted
                    by Mr. Theobald, without noticing where Theobald inserted I. Idem (in Boswell, ed. 1821):
                    Shakspeare . . . frequently introduces short speeches in prose, in the

                    Syr. Dromio’s description of her, III.ii.[93–102 (886–95)]. This is an ironical

            his] See n. 1352 (Din’d); again Capell (1774, pp. 77–8) objects to Rowe’s your on the grounds of lost humor. The emendation is made
                    without notice, without authority, and against reason: for the change of
                    address has some pleasantry; which an actor might easily heighten, by a
                    quickness of turn from the master to any one or to all the by-standers.
                Keightley
                    (Expositor, 1867, p. 94): The change of pronouns
                    is so frequent that I think it would be simpler to read your for his than as is usually done make my

                note 1364 (did); the dash marks a

                    merely humouring his master, but when it becomes clear that the remembered
                    experience of Dromio clashes with that of Adriana, Pinch brands him as
                        possess’d like his master. The similar disagreement between
                    what Adriana and Antipholus remember confirms them in their impatience (ll.

            Heart . . . Monie] See . Wilson (ed.
                1922): Cf. Nashe, Foure Letters Confuted (1592), ed.
                    McKerrow [1905] i, 301: heart and good will, but neuer a ragge of
                        money. . . . Unless both writers are quoting from some common
                    source, we must suppose that Nashe was borrowing from Shakespeare. Cf. McKerrow,
                        Nashe, i, 271–2: I borrowed this sentence
                        out of a Play. The Theater, Poets hall, hath many more such
                        prouerbes etc. The sentence Nashe borrowed: So Hares
                    may pull dead Lions by the beards, is from The Spanish
                    Tragedy 1.2.172, as McKerrow notes. The context, on sigs. G4–4v (the heart . . . money phrase is on
                    G4v), reinforces the likelihood of influence because
                it contains a reference to a physician, Dr. William Butler; the word coniure; and He had his grace to be Doctor ere he
                    died. . . .  In Norfolke where hee practised, he was reputed a proper toward
                    man at a medecine for the toothake, &amp; one of the skilfullest
                    Physitions . . . that euer came there (ed. McKerrow, 1:300–1). Baldwin
                (ed. 1928) believes that Nashe was borrowing from Err.:
                    But there is a still earlier variant of the expression than Nashe’s. In
                    Thomas Lodge’s Deafe Man’s Dialoge (S.R., February 17,
                    1592; but if really by Lodge, written before August 26, 1591) we find
                         . . . but neuer a rag of money [M1v]. It seems either that Shakespeare adapted the saying
                    accurately to his context and that Nashe is echoing him, or that Shakespeare
                    originated the expression and that Lodge has adapted it to his context, instead
                    of echoing it as did Nashe. In the latter case, we should have evidence that
                        The Comedy was in existence by August,
                    1591. But it cannot be shown that the expression occurs only in the work
                of these writers.

                (ed. 1857): The compositor [was] misled by the abbreviation of the word
                    [mistress] in the Ms. (A little after [1386], the folio has And gentle Mr I receiu’d no gold.)
                Mr is a characteristic form of
                Compositor B (see 956, 1386, 1647), hence not good evidence for misreading of
                printer’s copy here.

                see n. 1373–4. Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): The expression rag in connection with money seems
                    to indicate money worn extremely thin with use (just as a rag results from the
                    wear and tear of cloth), and is, perhaps, a survival of the time when money was
                    weighed, and not counted. Craig [Gen. Ed.] compares [Thomas] Heywood’s The Royal King and the Loyal subject [pr. 1637] (Works, [ed.] J. Pearson [1874], vi.44): And for the
                        Campe, there’s honour cut out of the whole peece, but not a ragge of money. The word is chiefly used by
                    Shakespeare as a term of contempt, as in Taming of the Shrew, IV.iii.112 [2097]:
                        Away thou rag, etc.

                    Cuningham (ed. 1907): I think this word [And] must have
                    dropped out of the line before God, probably owing to the
                    previous line also so beginning. Strong corroboration of this is afforded by
                    line [1386] infra, which begins with exactly the same word.

                    Shakespeare at the time he wrote these lines because of the repetition
                of possessed, Mark 5:2, 15, and he
                notes parallels between 1394–8 and Mark 5:3: No man could bind
                    him. Bishops’ uses possessed at 5:2, vext at 5:15; Geneva uses had at 5:2,

                    wording, Mr. Collier adheres to the folio: but this is one of the many places
                    throughout the folio where the stage-direction is purposely placed too early,—in
                    order to warn the actors to be ready.—Mr. Collier might have seen that when
                    Pinch calls out for More company! the three or
                        four had not yet entered to assist him.
                Foakes (ed.

                        him, for Antipholus clearly moves as if to attack her. Pinch’s cry,
                        More company may merely emphasize what a struggle Antipholus
                    puts up.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): The director has some freedom of invention here as to just

                    The priests had bound their victims in a chair before administering the
                    horse drench of sallet oil and sack. As the victims commented, no wonder the
                    devil was strong within them! Darrel and the exorcists generally made much of

                    Adriana runs from Antipholus [i.e., not from us], and at [1499] she speaks only of Antipholus
                    as having a sword. It is true that at [1623] she says both attacked with drawn swords, but
                    then she is inclined to exaggerate all that has happened, cf. [1612–16] and

                    Dromios should be very correct in language.
                Dyce (ed.

                ed. of Plautus, and of Cooper (1565), s.v. perhibeo: Nusquam perhibentur blandiores gentium [Menaechmi 262: Men say there are none more gentill or c(o)urteyse in any place of the
                        worlde] . . . is a catchy line that could easily stay in [Sh.’s]
                    memory. And this is what it seems to have done [quotes 1456–9]. I hesitate to enlist
                        gentle in the cause of Baldwin’s [Genetics, 1965, p. 60] arguments for the use of Cooper, as it is a
                    natural enough rendering of blandiores, but along with
                        nation, conflating the gentium of l.
                    262 with the natio of l. 258, it seems pretty good
                    evidence for Shakespeare’s recollection of the whole passage in this new

            I . . . aboord] Foakes (ed. 1962): Here Antipholus again promises to
                    carry out his resolution to leave Ephesus instantly, cf. [978–9]; this helps to
                    maintain tension, for his proposal to go threatens to impede a solution to the
                    action.
                Baldwin
                MS: At the exact end of [Act] 4 as marked in F1, Dromio S
                    exits to get our stuffe aboord. This is the culmination of a
                    sequence of such signals at the end of each act as marked in
                    F1: (1) conditional decision [269–71], (2) trial [611–12], (3)
                    decision [978–9], (4) decision foiled [?1460–1], (5) resolution. Here are the customary
                    five stages, each in proper sequence exactly signaled at the end of that stage.
                    These stages are according to [Terentian five-act structure] formula, and in
                        F1 are exactly marked as acts. There can be no possible
                    question; Err. was constructed with complete precision
                    in the customary five acts, correctly discriminated and marked in every instance
                    in F1. Sh. has used the succession of soliloquies in Ham. in exactly the same structural way to indicate the
                    progress of his thought, as critics need urgently to take into account in their
                    interpretations of that play.
                Baldwin’s
                (1947) is the longest exposition of the five-act question; see .

                    the action, in which the prevailing atmosphere of confusion and violence
                    threatens briefly to overshadow the earlier comedy; we are released back into
                    this earlier mood at the very end, as the Dromios have a few lines in prose, and
                    go off finally with a couplet recalling their tumbling, jesting verse.
                For Baldwin’s theory that Sh. had in mind the Priory of Holywell in

                    think these [swear it] or similar words must have dropped out of
                    the text, owing to the occurrence of the word in lines [1488–9]. . . .  There is no
                    room in the Folio line, hence the words may have been crowded out. Compare [1378, 1386]. It is idle to say that hear
                    must be pronounced as a dissyllable. In the many hundreds of passages in the
                    plays in which it occurs, no reliable instance can be given of other than the
                    ordinary monosyllabic pronunciation. To the poems the same remark

                1988): The direction and others is
                    vague, like three or four at [1394]. He quotes Wells’s note

        1498–1502
            Hold . . . spoyl’d] Foakes (ed. 1962): This is the final stage in
                    a crescendo of violence marked by the beating of Dromio, the fight, and binding
                    of Antipholus of Ephesus, followed by the entry of Antipholus and Dromio of
                    Syracuse with drawn swords, in IV.iv; normal order and normal relationships are
                    thoroughly disrupted, and a sense of magic has become a sense of evil (see [1231–61] and
                    n.). It is at this point that the Priory is first mentioned, with its hint of a
                    providential solution of difficulties.

                    discrepancy in the superior of the priory being entitled an abbess, but an abbey
                    seems often to have been considered synonymous with a priory (OED 1). Foakes (ed. 1962): Perhaps

                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907) compares much much in MV 3.2.61 (1404) and cites the Clarkes (1879, pp. 422–8) on
                Sh.’s frequent iterations. Less helpfully, he notes the too too
                construction of MV 2.6.42 (943)
                and other plays. He suggests and much indifferent, etc., meaning in poor health, ailing;
                    although there seems to be no other example of the construction of this word
                    with from in the plays.

                        much, the word different may be pronounced in
                    the usual way, which does not make sense. In the eleven occurrences of
                the word in the canon, Sh. never stresses the second syllable.

                    Baldwin (ed. 1928): Adriana regards her husband as
                    suffering from . . . the hysterica
                        passio mentioned by Lear: Hysterica passio, down, thou
                        climbing sorrow
                    ii.4.57 [1329]. Antipholus has been brooding for
                    some time, but his climbing sorrow has only now burst into the rage of
                    madness. There is no way to estimate whether E. Antipholus had been heauie, sower sad for a week or longer; is this one of
                Adriana’s exaggerations, as at 1611–14 (and see n. 1440–1)? Baldwin nowhere else pursues this notion of
                    hysterica passio, as he would have if there were better evidence.
                    Foakes
                (ed. 1962) compares Mac. 4.3.114

                Knowles
                (privately): She means origin, pattern, model (OED 8c). The Abbess says, you didn’t give him
                    enough reprehension; Adriana replies, all our conversations followed that model
                    of reprehension. No one has followed Malone or Schmidt, but cf. Porter &amp;
                        Clarke (ed. 1903): The pattern,
                    example, theme, where theme turns toward Steevens
                below; they offer no paraphrase. OED has probably misled
                eds. into confusion here; see Hulme below. Theobald (letter to
                Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols, 1817, 2:297): By copy, I suppose, we are to understand here the old word copie (à copiâ), i. e. the fullness of our conference, all the subject of our
                    talk. This sense of copia is fully covered by Baldwin
                (1944, 2:176–96) on the Erasmian copia verborum learned
                in grammar schools, the art of elaborating topics: Shakspere knew the meaning
                    of copy [he quotes 1531–6]. Adriana had evidently been quite
                    copious upon this subject of her theme, as every grammar school boy was expected
                    to be.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1778), perhaps influenced by Theame (1534), starts
                another line of glossing that continues to the present day: I.e. the theme.
                    We still talk of setting copies for boys. But
                this sense is not confirmed by OED; rather it says (sb. 11b): Copy of a conference:
                    memorandum or minutes of a conference; also app. the agenda or subject matter;
                    the theme, quoting only this line and N. Udall, Diotrephes, 1588, Gave his friende a copie of his
                    conference. The inadequacy of definition 11b for Err. seems clear. Hulme (1977, pp. 278–9) discusses OED definitions that are probably wrong, where evidence of
                    Shakespearean context points strongly to senses not directly confirmed by
                        [OED’s] authority. She quotes 1524–37: The
                    arrangement of the dramatic dialogue directs us to understand the main sense of
                        copy as that of the Latin copia, plenty, in swift rejoinder to
                    the reproach of not enough [1530]. . . .  [OED] indeed shows this [plenty] as one of the earliest senses of the word, but
                    for this actual phrase in Shakespeare’s text offers the definition agenda
                        or subject matter [etc., as above]; a number of recent editors
                    following the Dictionary give this possible secondary sense as their only
                    gloss. None of the nine other occurrences of copy in Sh.
                means anything else but model or reproduction.

                    now with a second fig. citation 1651] records this as the earliest and only
                    example of a figurative use. It is tempting to rely on the form in
                        F as indicating an inflected -ed,
                    but F is not regular, comparing 133 and 1692. Wells (ed. 1972) compares MND 2.1.75 (450) and JC 1.2.317 (427) where Sh. uses glance
                    at

                Scott (1982,
                p. 13): In one sense only, is the Abbess in as much error as anyone else, the
                    Antipholus she is protecting is not Adriana’s husband. Nevertheless her words
                    are valid in iterating the truths which the comic structure has portrayed. If
                    she is believed, all will be restored. The point about her mistake is
                not often made; it is analagous to Adriana’s at 505–41.

                    and which they said was peculiar to him; viz. by putting
                    questions whose tendency was not perceiv’d by the adversary, and then knocking
                    him down with his own concessions.
                Bucknill
                (1860, p. 76) and Doran (1916, 1:437) remark on the excellent account of
                    the causation of melancholia by domestic trouble (Bucknill). Irving &amp; Marshall (ed. 1888): There is a lifelike
                    vigour about the sketch of a nagging wife in this passage, which rather favours
                    the conjecture that Shakespeare did not leave Stratford—and his wife—behind him,
                    only for the purpose of making his fortune. The man who wrote the powerful
                    speech of the Abbess might well have tasted the bitterness of domestic
                    misery.
                Hankins
                (1978, p. 144) on Sh.’s early use of humors theory: This speech seems to be
                    almost a parody of sixteenth-century writing about the four humours. The wedding
                    of Antipholus of Ephesus to Adriana united the sanguine and the choleric
                    temperaments. . . .  They will continue to live in alternate periods of anger

            woman,] Schmidt (1886, p. 367) would keep the comma, reading Poisons in apposition to venome
                    clamors; he objects to eds. who without authority emend to Poison, though he in turn produces a fragment, i.e.,
                    The venom clamors of a jealous woman, Poisons more deadly than a mad
                    dog’s tooth.
        


        1539
            Poisons] I.e., produces rabies. See n. 14.
        


        1540–55
            It . . . wits] Elyot (1539, sigs. V2v–V4):
                    The diuision of melancholy, and the diete of persons melancolike,
                generally confirms the Abbess’s diagnosis.
        


        1540
            sleepes] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821) compares Oth. 3.3.416–17 (2064) and Ham. 4.7.30 (3038) for the plural
                rather than the usual singular.
        


        1540
            hindred] See n. 1464.
        


        1541
            light] Schmidt (1874, adj. 8): Deranged (OED, a.1 22, quoting this line as the first
                occurrence).
        


        1542
            sawc’d] Perhaps also with the sense of adding a mixture of
                    bitterness (OED, Sauce v. 2b).
        


        1546
            sports] Schmidt (1875, Sport subst. 1): Diversion; pastime;
                    amusement (OED, sb.1).
        


        1546
            hindred] See n. 1464.
        


        1546
            bralles] I.e., brawls (OED, Brawl
                        sb.1 1).
        


        1547
            Sweet recreations barr’d] Blake (1983, p. 103), commenting on various kinds of
                syntactic compression, glosses: If pleasurable recreation is
                    prevented.
        


        1548
            But . . . melancholly] See textual notes 1548 and 1548–9. Abbott (§484): Monosyllables containing diphthongs and
                    long vowels, since they naturally allow the voice to rest upon them, are often
                    so emphasized as to dispense with an unaccented syllable, scanning
                    But mó | ody | and dú | ll mél | anchóly. Some may prefer to read
                        dull as a monosyllable; but I can find no instance of
                        meláncholý.
                Browne
                (1884, p. 18): But móo-dý and dú-ll mélanchóly.
                Elze (1889,
                p. 3) scans But moo | dy and | dull mel | ancho | ly, and says of
                Abbott’s scansion: Had this scansion been proposed by a German scholar, it
                    would have been condemned unmercifully by all English critics.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907) justifies his emendation by noting the collocation
                    heavy-melancholy in two plays nearest to The Errors in point of date: LLL 5.2.14 (1901), He made her melancholy, sad and heavy,
                and TGV 3.2.62 (1509),
                    She is lumpish, heavy, melancholy. He
                continues: Cloudy is perhaps quite as suitable. It is an
                    epithet of melancholy in Titus
                            Andronicus, II.iii.33 [769].
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928) proposes melancholia, but in his MS agrees with Foakes
                (below). Wilson (ed. 1922): The context . . . seems to forbid the
                    possibility of a second [substantive]. Perhaps we should read
                        dull-footed for dull, which would lead to
                        her heels [1550].
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Emendation seems to me to weaken the line, citing Abbott. See
                    183.
        


        1549–50
            Kinsman . . . her] See textual notes 1548–9 and 1550. Eds. well into the 19th c. worried about the mixed gender. Warburton (ed.
                1747): Shakespear could never make melancholy a male in this line, and a female in
                    the next, marking 1549 as
                    spurious.
                Dodd (1752,
                1:52) first suggests that Sh. seems to have used [kinsman] in a general sense for relation.
                Capell
                (1774, p. 78): The splitting of a word in this manner [Capell’s] he [the
                    compositor] knew was uncommon, and thought it an oversight, but in that he
                    judg’d hastily; for divisions of the same kind may be met with in Jonson, and
                    other old writers, and some not of compounds like kins-woman.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1778) on Capell: I hardly think he could be serious.
                OED cites this as the first figurative occurrence of Kinsman.
        


        1549
            grim] OED (a. 4, 4b): Of stern . . . aspect . . . of things
                    personified, citing this line as the first occurrence.
        


        1550
            her] See textual note.
                    Heath
                (1765, p. 200) conjectures (independent of Thirlby) their without
                comment. Malone (in Steevens, ed. 1785) concurs on the basis that
                persons were generally referred to by pronoun abbreviations in
                manuscripts, noting 999,
                    F
                their emended to her. Idem (in Boswell, ed.
                1821): The huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures, and foes to
                        life, were the attendants, not solely on moody melancholy [1549], but also on grim despair [1549], and of course [Sh.] must have
                    written their in the following line.
        


        1551
            distemperatures] Capell (1774, Glossary): Disease, Sickness;
                    so call’d as proceeding from an evil Disposition of bodily Temperature.
                OED (2): Disordered or
                    distempered condition of the humours, or of the body; disorder,
                    ailment, citing this line and Elyot (1541). See n. 1540–55.
        


        1552
            In food] Onions (1911, Food): While eating (OED, sb. 5,
                citing this line as its last example).
        


        1553
            or . . . or] See n. 139.
        


        1557
            demean’d himselfe] See n. 1265.
        


        1557
            wildly] OED (adv. 3b): Rudely, roughly, savagely, citing this
                line as the first occurrence. Capell (1774, p. 78) blames the compositor’s
                    wantonness, and his love of a jingle for the adverb rather than the
                adjective (see textual note),
                perhaps not observing the preceding pairs of couplets.
        


        1559
            She . . . reproofe] I.e., she exposed to me my own self-rebuke. Adriana
                cannot blame the Abbess for using the same criticisms that she has already made
                against herself (OED, Betray v. 6. Reproof 3). The line has caused trouble. Jorgensen (ed.
                1964): She tricked me into testifying against myself.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): [She did] trick me into recognizing my own faults.
                Bevington
                (ed. 1988): I.e., she led me to see that for which I rebuke myself.
                The difference among these glosses perhaps arises from the lack of help in OED. OED (Betray v. 1b: To give up or expose to punishment) cites this line as the first occurrence, but
                does not clearly support tricked. Definition 6: To
                    reveal or disclose against one’s will or intention the existence, identity, real
                    character of (a person or thing desired to be kept secret) better
                supports tricked than led to. Another problem lies in
                the absence of an implied verb after me, e.g.,
                    expose, a fairly common kind of ellipsis; see the Clarkes
                (1879, pp. 295–312, Elliptical Style). Irving &amp; Marshall (ed.
                1888): Certainly Adriana has some cause to complain of the Abbess’s mode of
                    working up to her lecture against hen-pecking, for she cunningly draws on
                    Adriana to her own moral destruction.
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928): Throughout the story, circumstances have betrayed her to her own
                    reproof. She is not naturally a shrew; neither is she a Patient Grissell. When
                    her husband gives her cause for suspicion, she is suspicious; but she is willing
                    to forgive him completely if he will only amend his ways. She is hurt and
                    indignant at mistreatment; but when she thinks this is to be explained by her
                    husband’s madness, she is all intent to restore him to his wits again, according
                    to the most approved methods of her time.
        


        1559
            reproofe] OED (3):
                    Censure, rebuke, reprimand.
                OED (1): Shame, disgrace,
                    ignominy or reproach, citing this line, seems wrong.
        


        1563
            Neither] Intensifies No (1561); see OED
                        (adv. 3b), citing this line as the first
                occurrence. Cf. 1782.
        


        1563
            tooke] See n. 1501.
        


        1563
            sanctuary] Foakes (ed. 1962): The right of taking refuge from the
                    law in a church or sacred place was not abolished in criminal cases until 1625,
                    and in civil cases until the end of the 17th century, citing OED (sb.1 5).
        


        1566
            loose] See n. 193.
        


        1567–70
            I . . . me] Noble (1935, p. 109): In allusion to the vow made in
                    [the Book of Common Prayer, matrimony service] by either party: to have
                        and to hold from this day forward for better for worse, for richer for
                        poorer, in sickness and in health.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Adriana’s desire to have her husband all to herself recalls her
                    fastening on Antipholus of Syracuse, [567–74]; and reflects her jealous and
                    over-possessive love, a love disordered, referring to Brown (1957,
                pp. 54–7), who, however, does not comment specifically on these lines.
        


        1568
            Diet] Capell (1774, Glossary): To feed, simply: also,—to feed
                    by Prescription (OED, v. 2, citing this line).
        


        1568
            Office] See n. 673.
        


        1569
            atturney] Singer (ed. 1826): I.e. substitute (OED, Attorney sb.1 1, citing this line). Cuningham (ed. 1907), continuing
                his census of legal terms: A proof, however slight, of Shakespeare’s
                    knowledge of and fondness for legal terms.
        


        1571–81
            Be . . . him] Bucknill (1860, pp. 76–7): This medical and most
                    commendable Abbess not only traces the causation of disease, but undertakes its
                    cure. Adriana demands permission to nurse her husband . . . but the dear old
                    Abbess keeps the jealous wife where she ought to be, out of tongue shot, and
                    promises more active measures than diet. She promises prayers also; but in the
                    spirit of the injunction to trust unto the Lord and keep your powder
                        dry, she prefaces their use with that of syrups and drugs. The
                    monkish physic of the middle ages was practised by religious orders of both
                    sexes: indeed, it seems primarily to have belonged to the women, in the times
                    when every educated lady was a leech. See n. 1338–41.
        


        1571–7
            Be . . . me] Baldwin (ed. 1928): Caring for the sick was a
                    regular part of the duties of the Abbess. Since she is persuaded by her
                    cross-questioning that the husband is mad because of his wife’s nagging, she
                    naturally refused to turn him over for further mistreatment. See 1575–6. Williams
                (1977, p. 44) is strangely confused, considering that he directed the famous 1962
                production: Initially, as [the Abbess] surveys the true causes of the
                    friction which exists between Adriana and Antipholus, she shows singular
                    perspicacity. If her remedies—[1573]—have their own flavour of quackery, we should remember that she
                    is . . . addressing the wrong Antipholus. Possibly—as mother and Abbess—she
                    divines this. Her tongue seems to be somewhat in her cheek. Neither
                Antipholus is on stage, so there is nothing to divine.
        


        1571
            patient] Foakes (ed. 1962) refers to 1122 and his note.
        


        1572
            approoued] Foakes (ed. 1962): Tried (OED, Approved ppl.
                    a. 1).
        


        1573
            wholsome] OED (a. 2b, citing this line): Having the property of restoring
                        health . . . Obs. (or used in prec. sense) [2],
                    Promoting or conducive to health.
        


        1573
            sirrups] Doran (1916, 1:441) not very helpfully pairs these wholesome sirrups with the poppy, mandragora, and
                    drowsy syrups of Oth. 3.3.330–1 (1971–2).
        


        1574
            formall] OED (a., sb. 4c, citing this line as the only
                    example): Normal in intellect, sane, as probably also in TN 2.5.128 (1127). Steevens (ed.
                1773) compares MM
                informal women,
                5.1.236 (2612)
                for just the contrary of formall man. Riemer (1980,
                p. 113), referring to the same OED definition: The
                    word . . . , suggesting a return to essential characteristics, was a neologism
                    in the 1590s. It has connections with the philosophical, scientific and
                    religious interpretation of Plato’s theory of Forms by his Renaissance
                    successors. He gives no evidence.
        


        1575
            branch and parcell] They mean the same thing: part. (OED, Parcel sb. 2a): A
                    portion or piece of land; esp., in Law of Real Property,
                    as a part of a manor or estate.
                Cuningham
                (ed. 1907) detects apparently another legal reminiscence.
        


        1578–80
            I . . . wife] To explain Adriana’s fidelity, Carter (1905, p. 51) cites
                    Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:6; and for
                her rebuke of the Abbess, 1 Thess. 1:6: Ye became
                    followers of us and the Lord, i.e., no one should separate them; this
                citation is strained.
        


        1579
            your holinesse] OED (2, as a
                    title), citing this line. No editors have been influenced by this
                definition except Tetzeli von Rosador (ed. 1982), who says that the title is not
                reserved only for the pope but may be used for all princes of the church. But Sh.
                uses it elsewhere (MM, H8) only
                for the pope.
        


        1583

                Wells &amp; Taylor, 1987, p. 268), reading point’s: A dial does not point at anything, for the word definitely
                    meant the flat plate of the sundial. Probably modern spelling should be
                        dial point’s at, taking point to be
                    the pointed shadow of the dial. But OED (Dial sb.1
                    3): A timepiece or chronometer of any kind; a clock or
                    watch, contradicts McKerrow’s definitely meant, and the
                pin or triangular plate (gnomon) that indicates time on a sundial is not called a
                    point, nor is the shadow cast on the sundial so called.
                But OED is silent on just what point
                means horologically, leaving editors guessing about dial’s point in
                    R2 5.5.53 (2719) and 1H4 5.2.83 (2870).

                    action has pointed towards five o’clock, suppertime ([968]), as a point of resolution, when Antipholus of
                    Syracuse, the Merchants and Angelo arrange to meet to settle the affair of the
                    chain; it now turns out, appropriately, to be the time fixed for Egeon’s
                    execution too. See  for notions that the action of the play was keyed
                to the actual time of day.

            vale . . . heere] See . Cuningham
                (ed. 1907, p. xli) suggests that the vale may stand for Wapping, the usual
                    place of execution for pirates and rovers at low water mark. He had
                already identified the Priory as Holywell (p. xli). Baldwin (1931, p. 1),
                conjecturing: It would appear that on Saturday morning, October 5, 1588,
                    William Shakespeare attended the execution of William Hartley, seminary priest,
                    in Finsbury Fields, near the Theater and Curtain; and there received certain
                    impressions which shortly afterward appeared, transmuted by the magic of his
                    imagination, in The Comedy of Errors.

                    Malone
                (in Steevens, ed. 1785) credits Rowe with emending to death. The emendation produced a flurry of commentary, mostly silly. Hunter (1843,
                pp. 10–11): To me [death for depth] is a sad weakening of the passage. . . .  I presume that
                    Shakespeare knew perfectly well that where the executions among the Greeks took
                    place, there was to be found a deep pit, the βαραθρὸν, into which criminals were sometimes thrown, and that
                        Barathrum might, according to the practice of the time, be
                    rendered The Place of Depth, the deep and horrid pit.
                Dyce (1853,
                p. 32) rejects barathrum. Halliwell (ed. 1854):
                    Having regard to the probability that [Sh.] intended to convey the idea
                    of an intensity of depth to the melancholy
                        vale, which would add to its gloom, and also to the somewhat
                    objectionable pleonasm of death and execution, [accepts F]. . . .  [But] Mr. Hunter
                    suggests an allusion to the Barathrum, which would be irreconcilable with the
                    mode in which the merchant was to be executed.
                Dyce (ed.
                1857) again rejects barathrum because Egeon was to be
                beheaded and says that it means hell, citing Dekker, A Knights Conjuring (1607, sig. C3), Inraged at which, he flung
                    away, and leapt into Barathrum, and John Taylor,
                    Bawd (Works, ed. 1631, p. 92),

                    resurrection—a resurrection which is also presented as a rebirth.

                claims for justice of Adriana and S. Antipholus: Each clamours for an idea of
                    justice based on a private ordering of experience, and the conflicting evidence
                    of witnesses and supporters sets a problem too difficult for the law to
                    solve. . . .  The law cannot deal with this situation, and it is time for the

                    sum up the essential parts of the past story so we may have them clear and fresh
                    in mind for the dénouement. Shakespeare regularly uses this device of summing up
                    in his early plays.

                    in a prominent position at the beginning of a sentence, to express the subject
                    of the thought, without the usual grammatical connection with a verb or
                    preposition. He is not quite sure about this construction, which he also
                associates with §415: Construction changed.
                Salter
                (1951, p. 62), writing about Sh.’s development as a skillful user of silences,
                believes he is still a beginner in Err.: Does Aegeon
                    exclaim at the rather unusual name of Antipholus? Not at all. See n.

            important] See textual
                    note. Rowe’s all-potent points to his use of
                a folio later than F1 for his edition; as Norris (1885, p. 67) notes,
                Rowe used F4. Johnson (ed. 1765, 3:191):
                    Importunate (OED, a. 3, citing this line as the first occurrence).
                    Steevens
                (ed. 1773): Shakespeare, who gives to all nations the customs of his own,
                    seems . . . to allude to a court of wards in Ephesus. As Foakes (ed.
                1962) explains: The sovereign’s right of marrying his wards to anyone of
                    equal rank (see [Underhill, 1916], 1:386–7), as later in All’s W., II.iii.50ff. [1052 ff.],
                    the King offers Helena her choice among the bachelors who, he says, stand
                        at my bestowing.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): There is a piece of submerged narrative [incidents that form part of
                    the undramatized background] here. The probable explanation is that Adriana is
                    supposed to have been the Duke’s ward, and that he exercised his right of
                    choosing a husband for her. An arranged marriage might account for the
                marital strain.
        


        1610
            Letters] Halliwell (ed. 1854) prints a letter from Henry VIII to
                    a Mrs. Coward asking her to marry a trusty and
                    well-beloved servant, William Symonds, which shows how importunate such
                a letter might be. After compliments to her and a listing of his virtues:
                    We . . . desire you, at the contemplation of these our letters, to be of
                    like benevolent mind toward our said servant, in such wise that matrimony, to
                    God’s pleasure, may shortly be solemnized between you both. On whether
                the king needed to write more than once (i.e., our letters), see OED (Letter sb.1 4b): pl. with
                    sing. meaning, after Latin litterae.
        


        1611–12
            A . . . streete] Foakes (ed. 1962): Adriana accepted the
                    Courtesan’s lie that Antipholus broke into her house and stole her ring (see
                        [1275–8]
                    and n.), but now she extends it in her anger to make him and Dromio responsible
                    for general outrage and widespread robbery; what she imagines here contributes
                    to the sense of confusion and disorder in Ephesus.

                For strange as strong, Malone (ed.
                1790) compares 569. Steevens (ed.
                1793), however: A strong escape . . . means an escape
                    effected by strength or violence (OED, a. 1d, citing
                this line).

                    in with, . . . the admission of
                            here sets all right; and besides,
                    accounts for the entry of Adriana and her company upon the spot where all the
                    others are gather’d, being the same from whence they were chac’d at the end of
                    the last act.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1793): As Mr. Ritson observes, the meeting to which Adriana alludes, not
                    having happened before the abbey, we may more properly suppose our author
                    wrote—[as in textual
                    note].
                Malone (in
                    ibid.): I suspect,
                    Shakspeare is himself answerable for this inaccuracy.
                Idem (in
                    Boswell,
                ed. 1821): These efforts at emendation are wholly unnecessary. Though our
                    poet has expressed himself loosely, he plainly meant to say, that Antipholus
                    broke loose: and his mad servant and himself, being full of ire and furnished
                    with drawn swords, they met Adriana &amp;c.
                Baldwin
                (ed. 1928): The construction is beautifully mixed, but the student will have
                    no difficulty in understanding it, or in seeing how it happened. Nor probably is
                    it necessary to excuse it as a device to portray Adriana’s
                agitation.

                1854) note the anomaly for have. Halliwell observes the tense
                shifts in the next sentence: A license which is of continual occurrence in
                    writers of this period.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): The syntax is confused, but allows for the shift of attention from
                    present danger to what has happened (are . . . broke . . . beaten . . . haue sing’d), leading back to a
                    focus on the present (nicks) and future (will kill).

                    another (OED, adv. 2). Foakes (ed. 1962): Not used elsewhere by
                    Shakespeare (cf. Abbott, 24 [Adverbs with prefix -a]).
        


        1643–50
            bound . . . Coniurer] Mowat &amp; Werstine (ed.
                1996) find this reminiscent of Acts 19:13–16, where
                fraudulent exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil
                        spirits and attempted to exorcise a devil from a possessed man; when
                    the evil spirit determined that the exorcists were imposters, the man in
                        whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed
                        against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and
                    wounded (see ).
        


        1643–6
            bound . . . haire] See n. 1400. Robertson (1923, p. 152), who believes that Marlowe wrote at
                least the blank verse portions of Err., compares Edward II 5.3.36 SD They wash him
                        with puddle water, and shave his beard away, and 5.5.58,
                    And there in mire and puddle have I stood This ten days’ space
                (ed. 1973, 2:85, 91). Brooks (Gen. Ed., in Foakes, ed. 1962), apparently independently,
                cites the same passages, a play in which Marlowe followed historical sources
                    in making Matrevis and Gurney wash the King’s face in puddle
                        water and shave away his beard; later Edward says he has stood
                        in mire and puddle (V.[v].58).
                Wells (ed.
                1972) adds: Marlowe was working from historical sources, so if there is any
                    influence, it is probably from him to Shakespeare. His play has not been
                    precisely dated, but cannot be later than 1593, the year Marlowe died
                (30 May). It was entered in the S.R. 6 July 1593, and printed in 1594; Sh. might
                have seen performances earlier. The relationship has a bearing on the date of both
                plays, examined by Brooks (1968).
        


        1644
            Whose . . . fire] Critics find burning beards and hair as follows: Steevens (ed.
                1773), Aeneid 12:298–301; Weston (in Steevens, ed.
                1785), Plutarch, life of Dion; Malone (in Boswell ed. 1821), Phaer’s trans. of Aeneid (1584); but no Shn. dependence on them.

            patience] Foakes (ed. 1962): It is a nice touch that the
                    constantly impatient Antipholus of Ephesus (cf. [1300–1] and n.) should now
                    preach patience to Pinch. See n. 306.

                    note. Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821): Our poet has many other
                    alexandrines; and therefore the text is certainly right.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): [Rather than omitting to him] to make the line
                    run smoothly, and the might be left out.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Apparent alexandrines are common in Shakespeare, but a slurring or
                    elision of light syllables is probably intended (cf. Abbott, 494–8 [Apparent
                    Alexandrines]). Abbott does not scan the line in his examples. Wells (ed.
                1972): Probably to him counts as one stressed
                    syllable, and and the as an unstressed one.

            Cizers] Foakes (ed. 1962) compares TNK 1.2.59, where Cizard =
                scissored is possibly a Shn. spelling. OED gives no
                examples of cizers and of only the sing. cizar in the 16th c.
        


        1648
            nickes . . . foole] Steevens (ed. 1778): Perhaps it was once the
                    custom to cut the hair of ideots or jesters close to their heads.
                Tollet (in
                    ibid.): There is a
                    penalty of ten shillings in one of king Alfred’s ecclesiastical laws, if one

                Malone (ed.
                1790, 10:569) quotes Simon Robson, The Choise of Change,
                1585, rpt. 1598, K1v, here in the original wording,
                which Malone slightly changes: They [monks] are shaven and notched on the head, like fooles. See also Florio’s Italian Dictionary,

            scorch] OED (v.3): Obs. . . .  &lt;An alteration of score
                    v.; perh. after scratch . . . &gt; trans. To slash with a
                    knife. The frequent emendation scotch, beginning
                with Hanmer,
                is traced in the textual note.
                Defenders of scorch (OED, v.1:
                    To heat to such a degree as to shrivel) usually point to brands of fire (1644), e.g., Heath (1765, p. 201). Defenders of scotch such as Cuningham (ed. 1907) point to Mac. 3.2.13 (1167) where F
                scorch’d is famously emended by Theobald to scotch’d. Although Cuningham supports scotch’d,
                citing the misprint of Mac., he notes that
                        scotch is only used by Shakespeare in later plays such
                    as Macbeth and Coriolanus;
                        scorch in early plays, e.g., 3H6, Jn.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): The F. reading suggests the entry of Antipholus and
                    Dromio with burning brands at l. [1665], which makes an effective tableau.
                Tannenbaum
                (1932, p. 124): Because he thinks that . . . scorch means
                        burn or singe, Professor Wilson instructs
                    Antipholus and Dromio to enter . . . with burning
                            brands. . . . But a couple of burning brands carried by
                    two men ere the set of sun does not make an effective tableau.
                    Besides, it is ridiculous to suppose that Antipholus meant to burn the faces of
                    his wife and sister-in-law.
                Wilson (ed.
                1962) replaces his 1922 note with: The F reading is correct,
                    but means scotch.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) finds no warrant for Wilson’s tableau, nor for emendation, continuing:
                    In Warner, Menaechmus, feigning madness, cries to his wife, Apollo commaunds me that I should rende out hir eyes
                        with a burning lampe, where the Latin has you &lt;Apollo&gt;
                        bid me not to spare my fists at all on her face (pugnis me votas in huius ore quicquam parcere, l.
                    848) (see ). Wells (ed.
                1972): Referring to the brands of fire
                1644, implicitly following Heath above.
                    Roberts
                (1983, p. 112 n.) observes that Foakes has mistakenly compared Warner’s translation
                of Menaechmi 840–1, where a burning lampe is indeed the
                weapon (Apollo commands me) with the Latin of Menaechmi 848, which translates as you [Apollo] bid me not to
                    spare my fists. The Latin of 840–1 is Ecce: Apollo mi ex orclo imperat, | ut ego illi oculos
                    exuram lampidibus ardentibus (Lo! Apollo from his oracle doth bid me burn her eyes out
                    with blazing brands [tr. Nixon, 1917, 2:451]). Roberts (p. 111):
                    The belief that to draw blood on a witch, especially from her face, was a
                    way of removing her maleficium,
                    or at least a way of alleviating its effect, was a belief held in the sixteenth
                    and seventeenth centuries.

                    combination of spear and battle-axe, for defence.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): The display of force in this situation is likely to cause laughter,
                    and indeed invites burlesque.

                    rumour, in what Antipholus of Syracuse had heard about the city ([263]), has become a frightful reality
                    not only for him, but for Adriana too.

                    (3330), 1H4 5.1.122
                    (2761). Cuningham (ed. 1907) adds Cor. 2.2.92 (1306); North’s Plutarch, ed. 1595, p.

                (ed. 1962) notes that Sh. never uses bestrode. Wells (ed.
                1972): This is another piece of submerged narrative [incidents that form part
                    of the undramatized background], rather like one that Shakespeare uses at a
                    similar point of the action in Twelfth

                Foakes (ed.
                1962): These lines are printed as prose in F, possibly
                    because there was no space to print dote in l. [1671]. Compositor B
                apparently sets verse as prose at, e.g., 1775–6, 1813–14, 1865–6, 1881–2. See .

                    The whole thing is absurd—and it must be obvious that the author did not
                    know that silence as well as speech must be motivated. . . . It was not
                    convenient for the dramatist to have him speak.

                    names, not conveying, as other nouns do, the origin and reason of their
                    formation, are of course peculiarly liable to be modified, generally by
                shortening.

            Harlots] Steevens (ed. 1778): Antipholis did not suspect his
                    wife of having entertained courtezans, but of having been confederate with
                    cheats to impose on him and abuse him. . . .  By this description he points out
                        Pinch and his followers. Harlot was a term of reproach applied to cheats among men (OED, sb. 1). He
                cites, inter alia, WT 2.3.4
                    (903), where, however, harlot has the additional
                sense of sexually wanton, as noted by Wilson (ed. 1922, Glossary).
                    Cuningham (ed. 1907, p. xxvii) compares Warner’s translation
                (1595): Mul. Hee hauntes naughtie harlottes under my nose (see ), but not quite in same sense.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) thinks the sense involving fornication is the sense intended
                    here, comparing 531, 1344, 1389. Subsequent eds. are less sure, generally
                emphasizing Steevens’s definition.

            disturbed] See textual
                    note. Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821), explaining why he preserves
                    F reading (and making bold claims for printing house
                practices): I have exactly followed the old copy; we find disturbed printed at full without any ellipsis. It is a great mistake
                    to suppose that the punctuation of the folio 1623 is of no value; for though it
                    is sometimes faulty, it is as well pointed in general as the other books of that
                    age; and in such cases as the present is of great use; for printers never
                    abbreviate words by their own authority; and therefore when we find a word
                    abbreviated, as disturb’d, we may be pretty certain that
                    it was so exhibited in the manuscript transmitted to the press; and vice versâ, when the word is written without any mark of
                    abbreviation. . . .  The present line is perfectly metrical . . . for the
                        words—the effect, are considered as making but two
                    syllables, according to the usual licence of poetry.

        1695–1707
            This . . . Officer] Wilson (ed. 1922): This is curious after
                    Angelo’s speech (ll. [1689–90]) in support of Antipholus.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Antipholus was arrested at Angelo’s instigation ([1067]) on what seemed to him a false claim of
                    payment for a chain never delivered. Later Antipholus assumes that Angelo was
                    working in collusion with Adriana who had suborn’d him [1369]). So, in his imagination,
                    Angelo becomes a main agent in the conspiracy (cf. l. [1714]) he believes his wife has engineered against
                    him. His violent comments on Angelo here follow naturally from his initial
                    supposition. He answers Wilson’s objection by taking 1689–90 as an aside, whereby
                    the difficulty vanishes.

                    wronged person, in the warmth of complaint, is apt to dwell on every minute

                idiom seems so obvious that most eds. do not gloss it, either here or in MM. Tetzeli von Rosador (ed. 1982) notes that Wells
                gives no support for his gloss: The exact meaning is not very clear and the parallel
                from MM is not analogous. Apparently the form has an
                intensifying effect as well as an antagonistic one, as in OED (20a) (Ger.).

                    by its frequent use in 1704,
                    1707, 1708. Wilson (ed. 1922): This broken line, which
                    strongly suggests a cut, is printed as part of line [1712] by F.

                Wright
                (1988, p. 148) lists it among heptameter lines scattered throughout the canon for

                        dank, not from the adjective?

            Circes cup] Malone (in Boswell, ed.

                    below [quotes 1760]. Circe’s potion,
                    however, though it transformed the companions of Ulysses into swine, and
                    deprived them of speech, did not, it should seem, deprive them of their reason;
                    for Homer tells us that they lamented their transformation. However, the Duke’s
                    words are sufficiently intelligible, if we consider them as meaning—Methinks you
                    all are become as irrational as beasts.
                Dyce (1853,
                pp. 34–5) adds Vergil: Who evidently meant us to understand that those whom
                    Circe had transformed were deprived of reason [Aeneid 7.15].

                        Od[yssey] 10.133–260 is retold at length by Ovid in Met. 14.244–309, where Shakespeare probably became acquainted with
                    it. . . .  In Ovid’s version Circe’s cup (pocula) is twice mentioned.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) compares 954, adding: This
                    line [1747] is the culmination of
                    the images of transformation. See n. 954.

                are in Err., by far the highest frequency. Usually din’d, in both verse and prose lines. The line is oddly
                spaced: no space after the comma, a double space after at,
                and Porpen-tine divided. Compositor B may have tried to get
                the sentence on one line, and then adjusted, adding the -e to
                MS din’d.

        1762–1810
            Most . . . dote] Elliott (1939–40, p. 106): Aegeon is allowed
                    the centre of the stage for fifty lines. The pathos of his appeal to him whom he
                    takes to be my only son [1790] is very moving, but, of course, it is checked by his mistaking
                    Antipholus of Ephesus for him of Syracuse. Thus Aegeon is drawn into the
                    atmosphere of illusion; so even is the stiff-backed Duke a little later ([1850]). The tearful joys of the
                    reunion of the old man’s family are finely woven with enchanting mistakes (lines
                        [1816–1905]), and parodied at the close by the conference of the two
                    Dromios.

                and master in bonds. Wells (ed. 1972): [The puns on bondman and vnbound, 1770] may also indicate that [Dromio] has been
                    given his freedom. In Menaechmi [1029–30] the visiting
                    twin’s bondsman is given his freedom in return for helping his

                see Abbott
                §374. But there is disagreement. Capell (1774, p. 79): [Deforming] is more
                    poetical; corresponds more with the epithet given to hours, blaming the printing house for the
                substitution. Steevens (ed. 1778) agrees. Schmidt (1886, p. 360): Not
                the deformed, withered hand of Time, but Time’s deforming hand (which has the
                ability to deform) (Ger.). Foakes (ed. 1962), citing no evidence, contradicts:
                    Shakespeare may rather have been thinking of the withered hand of Father
                    Time, as commonly personified and depicted, cf. [463–4] (OED, ppl. a.

                    cracking the tone of voice, the hair grey from the want of sap, the ears deaf
                    from the dullness of sense—contains yet another reference to the flow of the
                    blood. [1794] is a kind of
                    physiological poetry which we may look in vain for elsewhere.

            seuen short yeares] See nn. 135–7, 1801, 1890. Whitaker (1953, p. 85):
                    The first scene is heavily indebted to Virgil’s Aeneid for details of Aegeon’s travels [citing Baldwin, 1944, 2:485–7];
                    but it has not been noted, apparently, that recalling Virgil led Shakespeare to
                    an inconsistency. In the first scene he described Aegeon as having wandered
                        five summers ([135]) as compared to Aeneas’ seven summers (I, 755–6).
                    But at the end he remembered only Aeneas, and Aegeon speaks of an absence of
                        seven short years.
                Wells (ed.
                1972) thinks the slip probably accidental, though he refers to
                Whitaker.

            grained] See n. 897;
                there the sense is dye-fast. Here eds. prefer furrowed, based

                    OED (Grained ppl.
                    a.2 2). Baldwin
                (ed. 1928) notes furrowed, but the word may be
                        grain in the sense of dye. Ægeon would then be saying that
                    his face has been dyed in grain by age and exposure to the elements.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) explains Baldwin: Burnt by exposure, a possible sense.
        


        1793–7
            In . . . heare] Hankins (1953, pp. 44–6) traces the images of sap-consuming, wasting lampes, fading glimmer, to Sh.’s familiarity with Barnabe Googe’s
                translation (1576 et seq.) of Palingenius’s Zodiacus Vitae
                    (Zodiake of Life) and with Pierre de la Primaudaye’s
                    The French Academie (1586). He quotes the Zodiake, pp. 122, 123, and The French
                    Academie, 2: chs. 38, 63, 69 on how bodies grow and decay, both of which
                use the analogy of a lamp sustained by a supply of oil, called the Radicall humour, because it is as it were the roote of
                    life (French Academie 2, ch. 69). Here,
                    The sap [1793]
                    is the radicall humor which is gradually consumed as old age
                    comes on. He cites 1H6
                    2.5.8–16 (1078–86), R2
                    1.3.221–4 (514–17), and others.

                    is declining, and which rubbing fetches off in small flakes.

                to snow, traces the simile to Rev. 1:14. A literary source
                seems unnecessary.

            froze] Abbott (§343): Owing to the tendency to drop the

                    obviously correct, the attraction of the s in some
                    causing the plural form in the Folio. Compare the
                        omission of the n in ne’er, line [1892] infra,
                    Dyce’s obvious correction for the are of the Folio.

            All . . . them] Capell (1774, p. 80):
                    The great and unparalell’d excellence of the fable’s catastrophe; which
                    breaks upon the fancy like lightning, at the very instant of the abbess’s entry
                    with her son in her hand: for all parties see the cause of their several errors,
                    and express it by looks; and the abbess’s relation to three of them is
                    discover’d in the face of her husband.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): This direction suggests that the group around Egeon and the Duke have
                    been absorbed in their argument, and do not notice the entry of the Abbess until
                    she speaks; it marks an effective dramatic moment as all turn to look at the new
                    arrivals on the scene; the twins are brought together here for the first time in
                    the play.
                Wells (ed.
                1972): The rather unusual stage direction is probably Shakespeare’s, and
                    suggests an intention that the wonder of the situation should be enhanced by the
                    reactions of the spectators on the stage.

                    angell that Painimes [i.e., pagans] thought to be apointed to eache man: the
                    spirite of man, noted by Baldwin (Genetics,
                1965, p. 61); OED (1). Cuningham
                (ed. 1907): It [genius] seems to be used for the
                    spirit or mind, as opposed to the natural man or mortal,
                comparing JC 2.1.66 (687).
                Cuningham, like Schmidt (1874), does not distinguish the meaning of a double
                from that of a spirit = soul that JC
                employs. Foakes (ed. 1962) compares Tro. 4.4.49–50 (2436–7): Some say the Genius
                    so Cries, come to him that instantly must dye, continuing, [James
                    A. K.] Thomson, Shakespeare and the Classics, p. 51,
                    cites a fine description of the genius from Spenser’s

                    The Duke says, in effect, And so of these two Dromios, which is the man
                        and which the Genius? The question of whom these indicates presumably governs the punctuation. Eds. using no
                punctuation or a comma apparently mean these to refer to the
                Antipholuses, the Duke mirroring Adriana’s bafflement. Those who, like Capell, use a
                colon or a period, mean these to refer to the Dromios, who
                answer as if addressed. In the latter case so = likewise,
                rather than being part of a compound conjunction and so. Capell (ed.
                1768) uses his symbol for a thing shown or pointed to preceding these in both 1817 and 1818; he would not
                have repeated the symbol if both theses had the same
                referent.

            Egeon . . . ghost] Halliwell (ed. 1854) prints a MS
                note of Thomas Hull’s about his adaptation of Err. (1779,
                pr. 1793; see  for Hull’s dialogue inserted
                between 1822 and 1832): I have always thought that some
                        part of the original play has been lost: neither Ægeon nor Æmilia express
                        the smallest surprise or joy at such an unexpected meeting, after a
                        separation of twenty-five years. My opinion has been sufficiently proved by
                        the alteration I have presumed to make of this comedy, from which I claim no
                        merit, but that of having reproduced a neglected piece of our great bard,
                        after it had lain hid for a number of years, to frequent exhibition and
                        universal approbation. Hull forgets the presumption of by-play so
                    necessary in almost every one of Shakespeare’s dramas.

            if] Murray (1966, p. 34): In the last
                        scene . . . if emphasizes the conditional quality of
                    identity in a madly twinned world. Adriana has just questioned whether her eyes
                    can discern her husband truly when Æmilia steps forward to claim her husband [quotes 1827–31, 1838–40, mistakenly cited as 1827–34, i.e.,
                        V.i.341–8]. Antipholus of Syracuse discovers his true
                    identity through his relationship to others, and he hopes for Luciana’s love,
                    though he still fears that all may be an illusion [quotes 1858–64]. In this play there
                    is no need to break the dramatic illusion, for there has never been a moment
                    when we could possibly forget that we are watching an illusion. The iffy
                    conclusion, together with the farcical quality of the pursuit of identity are
                    enough to remind us that the whole play has depended on the device of the
                    mask.

                        at sea] is one of Shakespeare’s oversights.
                Mason (1807,
                p. 54): The Abbess had not hinted at her shipwreck; but possibly we should
                    read [his].
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): Capell
                transposed the speech on the ground that her urging of the
                        wrack is unsupported by anything in Æmilia’s first speech.
                    But . . . she says nothing of the wrack in either speech and it
                    seems to us that the simplest way out of the difficulty is to preserve the
                        F. arrangement and suppose that some lines mentioning the
                        wrack have been cut after l. [1829]. The Duke’s here
                        begins shows that he seizes upon the resemblance as soon as Æmilia
                    commences her story, while her second speech appears to continue the account of
                    the wrack which should have been begun in her first. We are
                    indebted for this solution to a suggestion by Dr W. W. Greg.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) objects: This is pressing the matter of the wreck hard; I find it
                    difficult to believe that an audience, knowing from Act I all about the
                    shipwreck, would be troubled by the slight inconsistency here. The point surely
                    is that Shakespeare reminds us of Egeon’s story without allowing Emilia to
                    repeat what is well known. If any difficulty is felt, the simplest solution
                    would be to emend her urging (l. [1835]) to his urging, as Collier
                    suggested.
                Werstine
                (1980, pp. 393–4), noting that Compositor B, the most trustworthy of the three
                compositors who set Err., never transposed any of the 4,150
                lines he set in F from extant printed copy: It becomes
                    difficult to identify the source of the corruption which Capell’s emendation
                    would repair. . . .  [He compares Mason’s and Collier’s pronoun
                    substitutions, prefers Mason’s his urging, and continues.] Yet
                        her wracke is certainly an acceptable reading, for in the
                    play’s first scene Egeon stresses his wife’s suffering as much as his own:
                    [quotes 108–11]. The Duke’s recollection of Egeon’s urging of her
                        wracke would therefore be quite accurate. Naturally the Duke would
                    think of her wracke in his attempt to explain her presence in
                    Ephesus. Emendation of a single pronoun in the Duke’s speech seems sufficient to
                    restore the text.

                problem. OED (7 attrib. passing into adj. a. ¶): In poetry, morning adj. often connotes vaguely the attributes
                    possessed in the morning, or the fact that morning is the time referred

                    (1612, I doe heare the morning Larke) as the first

                    Ephesus.
                Ibid. (p. xxxi): There is
                    probably no point in raising the question [of how she got to Ephesus], except
                    that it perhaps illustrates that Shakespeare’s concern was not with geographical
                    accuracy, but was rather to stress names like Ephesus, which would be familiar
                    to his audience, and which he could put to dramatic use.

                    through [Emilia’s] intervention, the harsh justice embodied in the Duke is
                    tempered by a Christian grace and mercy; as part of a pattern of
                substitutions of mercy for justice in the early plays (Matthews, 1962, pp. 91–9,
                    Snyder,
                1979, pp. 25–6); Knight (1979, pp. 79, 77): Err.
                dramatizes a court of equity where the ruler suspends the law, taking the
                    nature of the circumstances into consideration, where English law, in
                its court of Chancery, upon occasion . . . functioned to provide
                    extraordinary relief . . . overriding justice with what might appear to be
                    mercy.

            Renowned . . . another] Hasler (1974, pp. 133–4) marks three stages leading
                to the final exit.
            
                (1) 1883–99:
                        Emilia invites the Duke and the whole company to come to her Abbey
                        (i.e., to leave the stage) where their fortunes shall be discoursed, and
                            satisfaction made. The special emphasis she lays on this
                        indicates how utterly amazed the assembled persons still are—and look—at
                        this moment. Her conceit of the labour-pains lasting thirty-three years
                        leads to the idea of a gossips’ feast. . . . Everything
                        seems set for the general exit. The address to you, my sons,
                        with its demonstrative force, already implies the grouping together of the
                        Antipholus twins. Next, Emilia gives the order of procession.
                (2) 1900–5:
                        To our surprise, the four protagonists of the mistaken identity plot
                        remain on stage. Most probably they are still paralyzed, giving every
                        appearance of amazement and delight. . . .  Having the stage to themselves,
                        this quartet now suffer a last relapse into confusion.
                (3) 1907–18,
                    the departure of the Dromios hand in hand because they have no way of knowing
                    who is senior. This gradual withdrawal from the stage . . . places a
                        last emphasis on the reunited twins. Before this, we have seen them driven
                        half-mad with frenzy. After all the bustle, the shouting, the beatings, this
                        quiet little epilogue for four introduces a new, warmer tone between master
                        and servant. At the last, the emotion of their reunion restores to these
                        figures of farce their humanity.

            And . . . satisfaction] Arthos (1971, p. 151): By this she means to
                    say that all these separations and encounters and unions, properly regarded, are
                    to be known as magically ordered; that the incidents have followed each other
                    not by chance but in accord with something like a magnetic principle, the
                    apparently random elements falling into a pattern as by a sorcerer’s mischief.
                    Her observation comes late, and although it may appear gratuitous we in the
                    audience are glad to accept the moral she is drawing for us, since, as any
                    audience, we are disposed to accept happiness as the due of those we have come
                    to care for, particularly when they are attractive and bewildered. For a little
                    while at least we are delighted to entertain the idea that a providential magic
                    could make it all turn out well.

            simpathized] Schmidt (1875, Sympathize 2 trans.): Entered into,
                    shared (OED, v. 3. trans. c). Also, OED (ppl.

                    elements, citing this line as the only occurrence. Foakes (ed.
                1962): An odd use of the word, extending the sense in which it is used at LLL., III.i.45 [819], and
                    in other passages in Shakespeare’s early work, of matched,
                    harmoniously contrived. The participle occurs in Luc. 1113 and Son. 82.11 as well as in LLL; 1887 is the
                only time the preterit is voiced.
        


        1890
            Thirtie three] Theobald (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols,
                1817, 2:297) recalculates the arithmetic of 18 years (128) and 7 years (1801): If the son left his father at 18 years old, and the father
                    found him again in seven years after . . . it was but 25 years past since his
                    mother was in travel of him. . . .  There are other characteristics of time to
                    be observed in this Play; but I question whether they will either confirm, or
                    impeach, this conjecture, citing such phrases as long
                    experience (750), Long since thy husband (1633), twentie yeares (1807). Theobald (ed. 1733): The Number, I presume,
                    was at first wrote in figures, and, perhaps, blindly [he does not explain]; and
                    thence the Mistake might arise.
                Capell
                (1774, pp. 79–80): Reck’ning from the time that one was taken from her by
                    fishermen, the other by the mast being broken; at which time, the children may
                    reasonably be suppos’d to have been two years old: and if we further suppose,
                    that the Ephesian Antiphilus was brought thither by Menaphon when he was five,
                    every part of the Author’s computation holds good, and Twenty three must be the reading.
                Clark &amp; Wright (ed. 1863) note that other eds. cite the
                Duke’s twenty-year patronage of E. Antipholus (1807): But three or five seems too small an age to assign for the
                    commencement of this patronage. . . .  But Shakespeare probably did not compute
                    the result of his own figures with any great care or accuracy.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922) The mistake may well be the author’s. Consistency as regards the
                    passage of time which affects the structure of the play is a different
                    matter, meaning that Sh. is negligent only about nonstructural
                chronologies. Foakes (ed. 1962) compares AYL 1.1.105 (101–2), 2.1.2
                    (608) on the inconsistency involving the length of Duke Senior’s
                banishment. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, pp. 107–8)
                notes that there is only one notice of age in Menaechmi,
                Peniculus’s Plus triginta annis natus
                    sum (More than thirty years
                    I’ve lived [tr. Nixon, 1917, 2:409]); Baldwin does the arithmetic:
                    If Aemilia’s thirty-three is . . . correct, this would leave a gap of
                    eight years for inquisitiveness to take effect, and send Aegeon’s twin wandering
                    at twenty-six. If so, curiosity would seem to have required the rather long
                    period of eight years to kill this cat.
                Arthos
                (1972, pp. 36–7): At the end, when the Abbess speaks of the new life that
                    lies before them all after their trials, she uses words of unmistakably
                    Christian reference. Thirty-three years have I but gone in
                        travail, she begins, putting herself in the role of a figure almost
                    like Providence, responsible for the new life they are now to have, but in
                    naming that particular number of years she introduces the unexpected suggestion
                    of the life of Christ.
                Muir (1977,
                pp. 97–8): If one adds nine months of actual pregnancy to the twenty-five
                    years of the sons’ age, one still gets only twenty-six; yet the thirty-three
                    years suit the Duke’s testimony, since he would have become Antipholus’s patron,
                    not when he was five, but when he was thirteen. . . .  It is probable that
                    Shakespeare knew what he was doing, and that he wished to achieve particular
                    effects in the two contexts. In the first scene it was important for us to
                    believe that Antipholus went in search of his twin as soon as he reasonably
                    could, and therefore eighteen years of age was more suitable than twenty-six. In
                    the last scene it was necessary to stress the length of time the Duke had known
                    Antipholus of Ephesus, and twenty years was better than twelve.
                Marcotte
                (1982, pp. 9–12): In his haste to complete an understandably disagreeable
                    chore [127–9],
                    Egeon does not trouble to describe in detail how Antipholus of Syracuse spent
                    the period of time that elapsed between his eighteenth and twenty-sixth year;
                    nevertheless . . . one of two scenarios is implied, either that S.
                Antipholus stayed with his father out of piety or that he started out to find his
                twin but returned, probably, once again, for reasons of filial
                piety.
        


        1890–2
            but . . . and till . . . burthen are] See textual note 1892. This much emended passage,
                actually beginning with Thirtie three, depends on how eds.
                treat burthen are. Once Dyce (1844, p. 30)
                conjectured ne’er, most eds. have been content to adopt it
                and let the other F readings stand: Our early printers
                    sometimes mistook ne’er (written nere) for are.
                Collier
                (1853, p. 86), reading and at: The Abbess means . . . that
                    she was, as it were, delivered of the double burden of her twin sons at the hour of this discovery of them.
                Dyce (1853,
                p. 36): The utter improbability that at
                    should have been mistaken for till either by scribe or
                    compositor, strongly warrants the belief that the latter word was really the
                    poet’s. Collier and Dyce continued to squabble. Kökeritz (1953, p. 313),
                noting wrong division of words involving n such as Nunckle (Lr.
                    1.4.117 [835]): This process will explain [ne’er].
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): The compositor may simply have misread a badly written burthen nere in MS.; perhaps the words were run together
                    and he misdivided them.

            Kalenders] Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821) says the Abbess addresses the
                Dromios because she ascertained with as much precision as a calendar, the
                    time when her sons were born, the twin Dromios having been born on the same day
                    with their masters, comparing 206.
        


        1894
            Natiuity] Here, and repeated at 1896, causes considerable comment. Clayton (1973, p. 481)
                proposes Compositor B’s misreading of Maturity, a
                    matter of mere minims, as well as according with a special
                    emphasis upon the end of the process of gestation at full
                    term.
                Williams
                (privately) suggests Maturity on the grounds of compositorial
                anticipation instead of the commonly argued notion of echo, leading to emending 1896. He cites the duplications at 154 (Compositor C, probably from carrying
                too much in his memory) and 1835,
                observing that in each instance the first word is emended: If we imagine that
                    as the compositor [B] set the first line his mind was thinking ahead to
                        Natiuitie in the third line, its second place, and as he was
                    about to set and to displace another word in the first place, then
                        Maturitie in his manuscript would look a good deal like
                        Natiuitie, and the error would have been facilitated by the
                    appearance of the two words. Though the word is not uncommon in Sh., it
                reappears in Per. 3.1.32
                    (1147) at the birth of Marina in a tempest, the source being the same
                    Apollonius of Tyre that Sh. uses for the romance plot
                in Err. See 1896.

                    having been formerly termed gossips. . . .  Both the godfather and godmother
                    were termed gossips (OED, Gossip
                        sb. 1a). Cuningham (ed. 1907) compares
                    MND 2.1.47 (418), where
                    gossip, however, means garrulous old woman. Wilson (ed.
                1922, Glossary, Gossip): Lit. a sponsor to a child, hence it came to be
                    applied to friends invited to be present at a birth (OED 2b: Applied to a woman’s female
                    friends invited to be present at a birth). Foakes (ed. 1962): Each of
                    the main characters is to be, as it were, named, to discover, or rediscover, his
                    or her real identity.

            go with mee] See textual note 1895–6. Warburton (ed. 1747) takes gaude from
                Fr. gaudir (rejoice), etymology attested by OED, but it gives no example of an English verb. Nares (1888) does:
                    Gaude. To sport, or keep festival; from the substantive. . . . 
                        Hence . . . gaude . . . which . . . much improves
                    the sense of the subsequent passage, but he resists adopting the
                emendation because go makes sense. Heath (1765, p. 202):
                    That is . . . Let me therefore invite you, who have assisted at this my
                    delivery, to accept of a feast; and to congratulate and wish me joy on such a
                    birth, after so long and tedious a labour.
                Steevens
                (ed. 1778): [Gaude] may . . . be countenanced by the
                    following passage in [John Palsgrave’s] Acolastus a
                    comedy, [1540]:—I have good cause to set the cocke on the hope, and make
                            gaudye chere. This is a
                misquotation of That we maye make oure tryumphe .i. kepe our gaudyes, or let
                    vs sette the cocke on the ho[o]pe, and make good chere, cited in OED (Gaudy sb.
                    4). Steevens cites Ant.
                    3.13.182 (2367), where gaudy is an adjective. Cuningham
                (ed. 1907), reading joy: Enjoy. I think the prefix has been
                    dropped here, just as in 2 Henry
                            VI. III.ii.365 [2080]: live thou to joy thy life. Compare rejoice
                    line 414 [1905] post.
                Wilson (ed.
                1922): We must suppose that joy became go by
                    attraction with go at the beginning of the line.
                Sisson
                (1956, 1:97): The Abbess is speaking, clad in her robes. Go to a

                Capell
                (1774, p. 80) blames the printers for the repetition. Steevens (ed. 1778): The
                    old reading may be right. She has just said, that to her, her sons were not born till now.
                Sisson
                (1956, 1:98): The repetition of the word Nativity, its
                    capitals not to be ignored, is moreover deliberate and emphatic. Nativity suggests not only birth but Christmas, the Feast
                    of the Nativity as Elizabethans commonly spoke of it and wrote it in legal
                    documents. Indeed, Nativity includes the notion of festivity. The nexus of thought and image is perhaps
                    closer than may be generally realized. Advent is a penitential season in the
                    Christian year, the long grief . . . followed by the
                    joys of the day and feast of the Nativity. Finally, the play was acted at a
                    Christmas Feast at Gray’s Inn on 28 December 1594. . . .  Nothing could be more
                    appropriate than this concluding insistence upon the word Nativity and the
                    spirit of the season, which the actors would hopefully emphasize. The
                capital N is probably one of Compositor B’s emphasis
                capitals, rather than a reflection of his copy, as Sisson suggests. Foakes (ed.
                1962): Any substitute is a guess, and I prefer felicity . . . only because it does not simply echo the word
                        feast, ll. [1895,
                        1897]. In the BBC
                production (1984), Wendy Hiller, having emphasized 1890 and 1892, made Natiuity just the right word. See 1894.

            Exeunt . . . Brothers] Collier (ed. 1842): It is
                    more likely that the two Antipholuses went out with Adriana and Luciana [at 1905], the two Dromios only remaining
                    to conclude the play. Possibly, the conjunction ought to be omitted, and then it
                    would stand, Manent the two Dromios, two brothers.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962) finds the form of the SD a fairly common Shakespearian one,
                comparing 1426.

                    faulty (in ed. 1768) that he did not insert for
                        you after ship-board; for he sees
                    no reason why Dromio should deliver himself in prose [in this line], all whose
                    other speeches are metrical throughout the act.

                    with the other gentlefolk, and . . . the two bondsmen remain behind.
                White does not accurately describe his own ed. Foakes (ed. 1962):
                    [Despite Exit], the two Antipholuses are surely
                    meant to go off here in harmony, as the two Dromios do at the end.
        


        1906–8
            There . . . wife] Elliott (1939–40, p. 106): The speaker’s
                    sense of relief is as vast as the girth of Nell. This speech brings us back
                    towards everyday reality. Yet it reminds us, surely, of this Dromio’s dread of
                    Nell as a diviner [929] and a witch [933]. Thus at the close there is a faint, last
                    flicker of the ray of weird light, romantic and comic, that plays upon The Comedy of Errors.

                    As each individual’s practical understanding increases through the
                    collective testimony of the trial, so also does his concept of self, seen now in
                    all its relations. The result is that he remains himself and yet is also a
                    function of other selves, as Dromio of Ephesus tells his newfound twin [quotes
                        1909–10].
                    It is in reflection that the self is completed, and it is this totality that
                    finally walks offstage in the new-baptized twins [quotes 1917–18]. Self and
                    reflection—subject and object—each walking on his own two feet, not one before
                    the other, seems to be Shakespeare’s final suggestion toward a solution of the
                    question of human identity.

                    were held in the hand of one of the party, with the ends peeping out, and he who
                    drew the longest one was the winner, giving many examples (OED, Cut sb.1 1β cites this line).

            Signior] See textual
                note. Werstine (Uses, 1978, p. 161): Senior destroys the signior-senior pun that is
                frequent in Shakespeare. The pun implies that the senior brother will enjoy
                    the same kind of deference from his junior brother that a Lord or
                        Signior enjoys. In this specific case, the senior or signior
                    would enter the Abbey first. The emendation senior can be
                    defended only on the grounds that Compositor B misread his copy and substituted
                        Signior, a word resembling his copy’s
                        senior. . . .  [But, he says, Compositor B was not likely to

                    passage thus seems superfluous. He compares LLL 1.2.8–18 (319–28) with its puns on

            Nay . . . brother] See textual
                    note. Cuningham (ed. 1907), printing as one line, scans Náy,
                    then, thús: we cáme intó the wórld like bróther and bróther, arguing
                that the last lines are examples of what Malone [in Reed, ed. 1803, 20:462]
                    called the long doggrel verses that Shakespeare has attributed in this
                        play to the two Dromios.
                Foakes (ed.
                1962): Cuningham may be right . . . but Dromio’s thus seems
                    to set off what he is about to say, to mark off his couplet.

                sons of the poor woman, the formerly beaten servants, who give us this message of
                equality and brotherliness because Err. is Sh.’s first
                critique of a cash-based society (Ger.).

            another] Steevens (ed. 1773), summing up: In this play we find
                    more intricacy of plot than distinction of character; and our attention is less
                    forcibly engaged, because we can guess in great measure how it will conclude.
                    Yet the poet seems unwilling to part with his subject, even in this last and
                    unnecessary scene, where the same mistakes are continued, till they have lost
                    the power of affording any entertainment at all.
                Wells (1986,
                p. 269), on the unfolding mystery in Act 5, suggests how the staging might be done:
                    So it seems that Shakespeare envisaged two sorts of reactions: Adriana’s
                    to the two masters (one of them her husband), and the Duke’s to both pairs of
                    twins. This suggests that the Abbess should enter with the master and servant
                    one on each side of her, and that Adriana should be so placed that both masters
                    are obviously in her view, whereas the Duke can easily see both pairs of
                    twins. . . .  [When Aemilia says 1825–6, recognizing Egeon], this is a trump card
                    for both Shakespeare and Aemilia. The characters on stage, I take it, reel back
                    in astonishment at this revelation of the Abbess’s secular past; and the
                    audience reels back in delighted, if abashed, recognition of Shakespeare’s
                    virtuosity.

      Irregular, Doubtful, and Emended Accidentals in F1

      The following emendations made in the Variorum text correct obvious typographical
        irregularities in F1. Mistakes that produce English words are not recorded
        here, but they are in the historical collation. In each note the lemma is the emended
        Variorum reading, and the first siglum is that of the source from which the emendation is
        drawn, followed by the rejected F1 reading.

      The Text



      
        Authorship

        Though there has been spotty resistance to attributing all of Err. to Sh., the consensus is that he wrote it as we have it in F. The
          following raise doubts:

        Ritson (in Steevens, ed. 1793,
          7:209): This comedy though boasting the embellishments of our author’s genius, in
            additional words, lines, speeches, and scenes, was not originally his, but proceeded
            from some inferior playwright, who was capable of reading the Menæchmi.

        Steevens (ed.
          1793, 7:316): On a careful revision of the foregoing scenes [he apparently refers
            to the whole play], I do not hesitate to pronounce them the composition of two very
            unequal writers. Shakspeare had undoubtedly a share in them; but that the entire play
            was no work of his, is an opinion which (as Benedick says): fire cannot melt out
              of me; I will die in it at the stake.

        Boswell (ed.
          1821, 1:15), transcribing Pope’s preface (ed. 1725, 1:xx): And I should conjecture of some
            of the others (particularly Love’s Labour’s Lost, The Winter’s Tale, Comedy of Errors,
            and Titus Andronicus,) that only some characters, single scenes, or perhaps a few
            particular passages, were of his hand. Pope does not include Err.; whether it was added by Malone or Boswell is not known.

        This mistake is noted by Eichhoff (1903, p. 32 n.), who, however, accepts Pope’s notion that all the plays printed
          in F suffer from an accretion of actors’ additions to the playhouse manuscripts over a
          period of years. Thus Pope accounts for much of what he thought was unworthy of Sh.
          Eichhoff attempts to locate and account for all such interpolations in
            Err. He ascribes 366 lines to this or these interpolators,
          including much of the low comedy of the Dromios and all the Courtesan’s lines, as having
          been added to please the populace. It is, for example, unthinkable that distinguished
          citizens such as Adriana and the Duke would be seen talking to a prostitute in the
          streets.

        Other critics who believe that Sh. adapted an earlier play include
            Oliphant (1909,
          p. 349); Wilson
          (ed. 1922, p. 77; withdrawn ed. 1962, p. 65); and Robertson (1923, p. 127), who writes:
            That any one should ever have seen a Shakespearean touch in any of it is a
            monition to us of the difficulty which faces every attempt to modify the temper of
            traditionism [he thinks Marlowe wrote the blank verse sections of Err.]; and Gaw (Evolution, 1926), who thinks that Kyd was
          responsible for part of the play and that Sh. wrote the Luciana sections.

        The following anti-Stratfordians attribute Err. to various
          figures: Theobald
          (1901, passim) to Bacon; Stotsenburg (1904, pp. 474–7) to Dekker; Hoffman (1955, p. 266) to Marlowe;
          the Ogburns (1962,
          pp. 250, 257) to Oxford; Sweet (1965, p. 95) to Queen Elizabeth.

      




      
        The F1 Version

        The Stationers’ Register entry is as follows: A diplomatic reprint of the Stationers’ Register
              entry.

        (In Greg [1955,
          p. 59]; Doctor Thomas Worrall was one of the Bishop of London’s censors. Greg prints a
          facsimile as the frontispiece to A Bibliography of the English Printed
            Drama to the Restoration, vol. 1, 1939.)

        The Comedy of Errors was almost certainly printed for the first
          time in the First Folio, sigs. H1–I2v. Err. is printed on pages 85–100 of F1, misnumbering 86 as 88,
          TLNs 0–1919.

        Compositor C set pages 85–88a (=86), TLNs 0–164; 87b–89a,TLNs 289–549; 91a,TLNs 743–808; 94b, TLNs
          1235–54.

        Compositor D set pages 88b(=86), TLNs 165–288; 89b–90, TLNs 550–742; 91b,TLNs 809–74;
            94a–b through 1234, TLNs 1128–1234.

        Compositor B set pages 92–93, TLNs 875–1127; 95–100, TLNs 1255–1919. No quarto is known.
          It is the fifth of the comedies. The first four were printed from transcripts made by
          Ralph Crane, and the next four, Ado, LLL, MND, and MV were printed
          from quarto copy. Since Err. was probably printed from Sh.’s foul
          papers (argued in detail below), Jaggard’s compositors encountered Sh.’s handwriting for
          the first time in setting Err., which may account for some of the
          mistakes in the text. Wilson (ed. 1922, p. 65) raises the question of whether
            F1 was set from a quarto because he finds no instances of what he
          thinks were characteristic Shn. spellings, which would, he says, have been smoothed out by
          earlier compositors, but he dismisses the possibility in favor of his theory that copy for
          F involved dictation and annotation (see below). The folios of 1632, 1663–4, and 1685
          copied each other in succession without recourse to other printed or manuscript copy.

        The play is divided into acts but not into scenes save for Scena
            prima or Prima for all but Act 2. Catchwords vary at
            H4–H4v: Ant. What (set
          by Compositor D) | Anti. What (set by Compositor B),
          and at H5–H5v: Stigma- (set by Compositor B) |
            Stigmaticall (set by Compositor D). The last page of Err. requires only the top fifth of I2v, the rest
          being filled up with a large FINIS between two rules and by a printer’s ornament.

        Hinman (1963,
          1:257–8): H5v (page 94, Comedy of
              Errors)—three variants; H2 is invariant. 1.

                also Lee and Yale 2. a59Siracusian. [TLN 1183]

                  b33Delay
            Note. Although H5v is the only page
            in its quire which has been found to reflect proof-correction, we should perhaps notice
            that the e of reason [258] in H4b32
            sometimes stands so high as not to allow the r and the a
            to print; and that in some copies, on the other hand, the word is evenly
            printed. . . . In the present instance (in page H4, that is) we find that many copies
            show something between a strikingly imperfect impression and an
            altogether even one. Hence, therefore, we cannot suppose stop-press
          correction.

        Werstine (Unrecorded Variant, 1978, pp. 329–30): 
              
                H2vb11

                it? so you] all other Folg. copies
              
             Evidence of type batter indicates that the first reading listed is the
            uncorrected state. In variant copies 64 and 79 [imperfect copies of F not collated by
              Hinman] and in
            four other copies (16, 43, 56, 68), the h of the in H2vb63 is undamaged, but in all other copies it is damaged.
            Clearly then copies 64 and 79 were among the first copies of H2v:5 to be printed and they preserve the earlier, uncorrected state of the forme.
            Proofreading of H2v must have been unusually prompt, for
            only two of eighty-two Folger copies of the page show the uncorrected
            state. . . . 

        [330] This single variant may remain the sole
            witness to the several rounds of careful proofreading that produced a clean text of the
            play.

        Hinman (1963,
          2:389–92), using evidence drawn from rules, the misnumbering of p. 86 as 88, and the
          patterns of recurring distinctive type, demonstrates that quire H was set in the normal
          Folio fashion, that is, set by formes from the innermost to the outermost type pages, from
          cast-off copy, by compositors setting forme pages simultaneously. Quire I was set out of
          normal sequence (ibid. 2:395–7): I3v:4, I3:4v, I1v:6, I2:5v, I1:6v, I2v:5, where I3–I6v contain Ado. Hinman has no explanation for this odd order of setting.
          Compositors C, D, and B set the play.

        Each compositor normally set from his own type case and distributed the pages he had set;
            Hinman calls
          these cases x, y, and z. He makes this analysis by observing the recurrence of battered
          individual types in successive formes and by charting the order of setting and of
          distributing the types back into their type cases (for Err.,
          2:388–97). He correctly assigns B’s pages but is uncertain about a few pages he thinks
          were set by Compositor D: H3, H2, H1v, and H1. He proved to be
          wrong about H4b and H2v as well.
          Further analysis by Howard-Hill (1973), O’Connor (1975), and Werstine (1982) has apparently settled the compositors’
          stints. I use Werstine’s case designations (r, s, t) because Hinman could not identify the
          cases correctly until quire I. Formes in parentheses indicate the setting of Ado.

        Once Hinman had
          determined the order of printing and made what compositorial assignments he could, others
          turned to solving the questions he candidly raised, especially about printing the
          comedies, undertaken in Jaggard’s printing house simultaneously with the printing of
          Thomas Wilson’s Christian Dictionary (1622) (1:343–6).

        McKenzie (1969 and 1984) has attacked the enterprise of inferring much
          about the order of printing as detailed by Hinman, or detecting spacing preferences such
          as Howard-Hill and others have done. He in turn has been opposed by Jackson (1987) and Tanselle (1991), who
          judge that the force of corroborative evidence of various kinds brings assurance of
          validity.

        The work on the compositors done by Willoughby (1932), Walker (1953), and Hinman (1963) was refined by Howard-Hill (1973),
            O’Connor (1975),
            Reid (1976), and
            Werstine (1982),
          who have settled the stints of these three in Err. The earlier
          spelling tests showed Compositor B’s preference for spelling do,
            go, heere. His reputation as a bad
          typesetter of Sh.’s plays (Walker) has been rehabilitated by Werstine, and now he is
          regarded as one of the best who worked on F. Reid expands the list of B’s spelling
          preferences. Hinman (1:193–6) first identifies Compositor C as a doe, goe, here speller, and
          (1:196–7) Compositor D as one who slightly prefers doe-goe to do-go, and
          strongly prefers here.

        Howard-Hill
          expands the typesetting habits beyond Walker’s simple spelling tests. He adds to the list of
          spelling preferences and shows that compositors treated spaced and unspaced commas in
          short lines and at the ends of lines in distinguishable ways. He also (p. 71) notices that
            there are occasions on which compositors, obliged to turn over a line of verse
            which was too long for their measure, and unable or unwilling to set it as a turn-down
            or turn-up at the right margin of the column, have carried the remaining part of the
            line on to the next line. Often these have been indented from the left-hand
            margin. These lines he calls indented turn-overs. He gives the
          following table of indented turnovers up to WT: 
            
              Compositor
              B
              C
              D
             
              Pages set
              14

              Occurrences

              2
              94
            
           On the basis of these preferences, he says (p. 72): It is therefore more
            likely than not that any page with more than one such indented turn-over was set by
            compositor D, and it is very unlikely to have been set by . . . C.

        These preferences show Compositor C at work in quire H on columns Hinman is unsure about (H3a, H2b, H1va, H1a and b) and correct Hinman’s attribution of H4 and H2v from Compositor D to Compositors C and D. Howard-Hill does not use damaged-type
          evidence to corroborate his spelling or psychomechanical evidence such as spacing, but his
          expansion of typesetting habits greatly improves identification of compositors and their
          stints.

        O’Connor accepts
            Howard-Hill’s
          reassignments except for H3v (he assigns it to Compositor C,
          not Hinman’s and
          Howard-Hill’s D) and the last twenty lines of H5vb (which he
          assigns also to Compositor C, not D). He usefully invents (p. 89) the term indented
            flow-over for Howard-Hill’s indented turn-overs. Despite D’s
          clear preference for indented flow-overs—36 on H3v—O’Connor
          assigns H3v to C because he finds C’s preferred you’ll (663, 692, 702) and the contractions ye,
            yu, yt on that page; he accounts for the flow-overs as the
          result of tumbling-verse dialogue [in H3v and L6–L6v], where little or no room exists for a turn-over (p.
          90). This assignment of all H3v has not been generally
          accepted, but that of H5vb
          1235–54 to Compositor C
          has been. There O’Connor (pp. 112–13) finds gon and wee’ll, C preferences, as well as a failure to fill out line 1234 with a short And for
          which there is room; he compares 1200, where
            but fills the line, and he argues that between 1234 and 1235
          something caused Compositor C to replace D. Like Howard-Hill, O’Connor expands the number
          and range of spelling preferences that help identify individual compositors; like him,
          O’Connor does not use battered-type evidence to support his spelling preferences.

        It remained for Werstine (1982) to test Hinman’s battered-type tables to see whether they could
          corroborate the newly assigned compositorial stints of Howard-Hill and O’Connor. Hinman, believing that only
          two compositors set quire H (but open to the possibility that one or more other workmen
          participated in setting the quire), is puzzled by observing that types from the upper and
          lower portions of a preceding type page recur in the work of compositors different from
          the ones who set the preceding page; this means that compositors distributed parts of the
          same type pages, in a way unlike the normal Folio practice—normal after a few more quires
          had been set—of each compositor’s distributing only his own pages. Werstine, using the
          types identified by Hinman, confirms or slightly changes the stints analyzed by
          Howard-Hill and O’Connor; he shows that in fact from the beginning of Folio setting, three
          type cases were employed, the ones Hinman only firmly locates as beginning in quire K.

        Case differentiation settles the Howard-Hill–O’Connor assignments of H3v
          (Compositor D) and lower H5vb (Compositor C). Werstine points out
          that, because no forme in quire H was set entirely by a single compositor, each
            forme provided an opportunity for simultaneous composition by at least two workmen and
            sometimes by all three (p. 212; he judges that all but H2:5v and H3v:4 underwent some degree of
          simultaneous composition).

        He draws (p. 234) two major implications for editors and textual critics of the
            early Folio comedies. The first deals with cast-off copy for quires G and H. Ordinarily,
            as Hinman
            observed, when a quire was set in normal Folio printing order, there was need to cast
            off copy only for the first half of the quire, since the pages of the second half were
            set in their reading sequence [4–6v]. . . . However,
            simultaneous composition of successive formes of a quire—possible for quire G, probable
            for quire H—would have necessitated casting off copy for both halves of the quire so
            that compositors could work concurrently from separate blocks of copy to set pages of
            the second half of the quire. Thus editors must be wary of compositorial attempts to
            stretch or squeeze the texts of MM and Err. into the space available. One such attempt is evident in the last half
            of quire H at the bottom of H5vb, set by Compositor C, and
            the top of H6a, set simultaneously by Compositor B, where verse is compressed into
            prose. Second, identification of cases x, y, and z [his former r, s, t] in quires G–I
            confirms attribution of pages in these quires to Compositors B, C, D, and F. Editors of
            the Folio Comedies may then have greater confidence in using the available studies of
            compositorial accuracy in arriving at judgments about when and how to emend.
            (Werstine
          [2001], doubts that Compositor F, supposed to have set pages of the four comedies
          preceding Err. from Ralph Crane copy, can be differentiated from
          Compositor D, i.e., he does not exist.)

        Werstine’s
          example of verse compressed into prose on H5vb–H6a is weakened by observing how erratic that verse
          is (1254–8; what did the
          compositors see in their copy? see n.),
          and how much white space appears in the SDs on H6. The evidence of compression on H5vb is the turnunder of (sup|ping (1248–9)—one of only three turnunders in the entire play, one by each
          compositor—and, in the last line of the column, no space between the SP and the first line
          of a prose-lined speech, which is squeezed in when the last word naile might have been set on the next page. However, Compositor B’s H6a shows no sign of compression carrying over from H5vb. As Werstine argues, Compositor B was probably setting H6
          simultaneously from cast-off copy, leaving Compositor C to make all the necessary
          adjustments to get his allotted text into his type pages; nothing about the difficulty of
          reading printer’s copy can be inferred from how B set the top of H6.

        Because the compositors are setting from Sh.’s MS for the first time, how they punctuated
          their stints proves interesting. If Hand D of Sir Thomas More is
          really Sh.’s, he punctuated very lightly; indeed, fewer than 20 marks appear in the type
          facsimile in Evans
          (ed. 1974, pp. 1686–96). Such light pointing would impede reading comprehension, so when
          such copy came to the printing house, it is look’d on as a task
              and duty incumbent on the Compositor, viz. to discern and emend
              the bad Spelling and Pointing of his
              Copy (Moxon, 1683–4; 1962, p. 192). Moxon goes on to say (p. 215): As
            he Sets on, he considers how to Point his
            Work, viz. when to Set , where ; where : and where . . . . But
            the Rules for these having been taught in many School-books, I need say nothing to them
            here, but refer you to them. If Sh. carefully punctuated Err., we would expect the compositors to follow his punctuation in such matters
          as the use of colons, semicolons, periods, and capitalization after midline question marks
          and periods; they were expected to follow good copy strictly (p. 192). In too lightly pointed copy, however, they were to make
          sense of the text. What happens is that each compositor treats the pointing differently. I
          do not mean that each compositor parses his text in a distinguishable way but rather that
          each shows preferences in his choice of punctuation marks. The following chart shows how
          each compositor handles colons and semicolons between the beginning and the end of verse
          lines and within prose passages; how frequently each capitalized after internal question
          marks; and how often each capitalized after an internal period. The relative lack of
          midline punctuation in the figures below reflects the fact that in Sh.’s early blank verse
          the clause and the metrical line coincide most of the time.

        There is little difference in the punctuating styles of Compositors C and D, but
          Compositor B is different from them in the clause break: category and especially so in his
          following an internal period with a capital letter. It may be that Sh.’s own punctuation
          was more nearly like C’s and D’s.

        The charts below show the total SPs for the major speaking roles (Chart 1) and the SPs
          for the Antipholuses in the order in which the type pages were set (Chart 2).

        The compositors set from cast-off copy, setting H3v–H4 first;
          that is, they started at Act 3; then Compositors C and D went backwards to the beginning
          of the play, and Compositor B went forwards to the end, save for H5v, which was set by the other two.

        In this play with two Dromios and two Antipholuses, keeping the Ephesians and the
          Syracusans straight is useful, especially for a reader. So when D and C begin setting
            (H3v for D, H4a for C), they
          distinguish, though not consistently, which Antipholus and which Dromio is speaking. They
          probably had some guidance from their copy, but they apparently choose the form of the SP.
          Compositor D sets E. Anti., E. Ant., and E. An. 5 times (all in column a), and plain Anti. 3 times and Ant. once. By column b he has settled on
            Anti. and Ant. He distinguishes between
            E. and S. Dromio in 26 prefixes. When he
          sets H4b, however, he sets Ant. 9 times
          after an initial S. Anti., and one S. Dro.
          to two Dro. Compositor C, setting column a, sets only Ant. and Anti. (He also sets Iuliana and Iulia., apparently unable to read Sh.’s
          indication that Luciana enters and speaks. He gets the names right thereafter.) As C
          continues to set his pages, however, he always but thrice (352, 355, 358) sets E. Dro. (6
          times) or S. Dro. (28 times) plus a crowded S.
            Dr., and Compositor D thereafter fails to use the markers only 5 times (179, 550, 868, 872, 1136), 2 of
          them at the bottom of H4b where he seems to be running out of
          space for the allotted words.

        The Antipholuses are treated differently. They are hardly ever distinguished, as for
          example on H2vb, where Compositor C sets 17 S. Dro.s and 14 Ant.s (plus 1 Antiph., 1 Anti., and 2 An. in a
          full line and a catchword). Only in Act 5, when at 1820 the brothers start appearing together, does Compositor B, or the copy,
          consistently identify them.

        In these charts, f indicates a full type line so full that it requires
          abbreviation or turning over.

        Since all the compositors follow this pattern of designating the Dromios but not the
          Antipholuses, they are probably following copy, where keeping the Dromios straight is
          important because they are the cause of so much confusion from 1.2 on. Compositor C sets
            Antip. at the bottom of H3a, having
          set An. six times at the top of the column; the speech,
            Plead you to me faire dame? I know you not, is the climax to Adriana’s
          attack on her husband for neglecting her, and the SP may well be authorial,
          though shortened to justify the line. Compositor C then sets H2v, with three Ant.s and one E. Ant.
          in column a, but then Antiph. at the top of column b before
          settling into Ant. (with one Anti. and
          another An. at the bottom of the column, set in a short line,
          followed by An. in a condensed catchword). These anomalous
          spellings come near the beginning of Compositor C’s setting of Antipholus’s speeches, and
          he may have been trying to figure out what the best SP should be.

        Next (Chart 1), we see that all three prefer Ant. compared with
          B’s frequent Anti. and prefer or tolerate the shorter Adr. and Luc., the forms that B much prefers.
          The first time Compositor C sets Luciana’s speeches (after recovery from calling her
              Iuliana in H4a), he
          sets Luci. (H3a and H2va); and the first time he sets Adriana’s speeches, he sets Adri. (H3a, 2v, except for one Ad. in a full line), but on H2b, the only other time he sets her speeches, he sets Adr. five times and Adri. another five,
          including a catchword. It is tempting to think that the long form is influenced by copy.
          Compositor D, however, strongly prefers Luc. and Adr. from the beginning.

        In Act 5, Egeon enters, called by a number of variations on Father. He is Mar. Fat. (I1va in the order of setting);
            Merchant of Siracuse (SD, I1b); Fa. (4 [2f]), Fath. (3), Father. (in a verse line set as two prose lines), Fat. (1),
          all on I2a; and Fa. once again, in the
          next column. Mar. Fat. and Merchant of
            Siracuse look authorial, but the remaining forms are anybody’s guess.

        Compositor B has been studied thoroughly, including his setting of
          verse as prose by Werstine (1984), who does not study Err.
          because he deals with how compositors change printed copy in setting F, and how
          Compositors A and B demonstrate different lining habits. Compositor B’s tendency to set
          SDs flush right has been noticed, but no one has observed another punctuating habit, that
          of omitting periods in many SDs and, in Err. but not often in the
          other plays he set, at the ends of sentences that fill up his type measure. In the
          comedies, only Compositor B regularly omits periods in SDs; Compositor D does it once much
          later (Q4vb 456), and Compositor A also once (Aa2vb 452). (In the histories, Compositor A fails to punctuate just
          seven times; in the tragedies, when Compositor E appears, he fails to punctuate about as
          often as B.) These full-set lines lack periods: 1111, 1388, 1398, 1562, 1597, 1851, 1901.

        
        We saw above that Howard-Hill and O’Connor were interested in indented
          flow-overs as a way of distinguishing compositors. I am now looking at what happens when
          compositors do not indent turned verse lines. A feature of
            F1
          Err. is lines of verse set as prose, scattered between 347 and 1914–15 but clustering in the work of Compositor B (1335 through 1916), as listed below. In most of the instances involving
          10-syllable lines, one or two words are turned under at the left margin for lack of space
          in the first type line. To produce these flow-overs, all three compositors often set extra
          spaces between words and commas.

        Likewise, variable spacing—compressed and expanded—is a standard way compositors meet the
          demands of fitting text into the space available. Expanded spacing is used to make space
          to fit in text that has been undercounted in casting off. The frequency with which
          Compositor B uses expanded spacing seems to have no bearing on this verse lined as prose,
          since he could have indented his flow-overs and achieved the same spatial effect.
          Compositor B expands normal spacing significantly more often than the others do,
          especially in Err., where he is setting from a different kind of
          copy from what he had before. Here are examples of his practice, contrasting normal
          spacing with extra spacing. Free from these slanders, and this
                open shame. [normal spacing]
            Anti.Din’d at home ? Thou Villaine,whatsayest thou? [extra] 1351–3 or Dro.Perdie, your doores were lockt ,and you shut out. [extra] 1356–7
          There is not quite enough space to fit thou? and out. into 1352 and 1356, so Compositor B adds spaces to justify the line before
          going on.

        Compositor B does not try hard to fit the verse line into the type line by abbreviation:
          but see husbãd (1608),
            yt (a logotype, the t above the cleft of the y) (1673), and &amp; (1909), as well as the missing periods noted above. This list
          does not include SDs set flush with the right margin, which he punctuates with periods
          about half the time (8 of 15).

        Compositor D abbreviates when he can: If ye skin were parchment, &amp; ye
              blows you gaue were ink, (631,
            with two logotypes); countermãds (1146), Iudgmẽt (1149), hel (1149).

        The single certain example from Compositor C’s work (442–4) is slightly different; see the
          discussion below: S.Dro.Was there euer anie
                man thusbeaten out of season,when in
                the why and the wherefore,is neither rime nor reason. Well
                sir,I thanke you.

        In the Folio pages set before Err., I find two instances of
          these open-spacing practices, both in the work of Compositor B in MM: at F6a, 1251–2, in a passage of concealed verse
          lines 1249–61; and at G3va, 2200–1. There are a few in the
          remainder of the comedies: K6a, 2347–8, where Q Ado, printer’s copy for F, has verse; M3va, 2049–50, where Q LLL has one verse line; M3vb, 2112–13 and 2114–15, where Q LLL
          has verse; P6va, 2169–70; S6vb,
          1084–5; T3vb, 1896–7; X1b, 1500–1.
          Flow-overs of verse lines do occur, but they are either unspaced or indented, e.g., A1b, 66–7, unspaced; E2va, 1652–3,
          unspaced; E5va, 2389–90, unspaced; F1b, 83, spaced but indented; K4a, 1808–9, verse as
          prose copied from Q Ado; X2b,
          1719–20, unspaced.

        
        The combined effect of these mislineations is that the compositors misrepresent the verse
          lines of their copy. The flow-overs produced by spacing are important because of editorial
          uncertainty about whether to treat the lines as verse or prose. Now, however, editors are
          justified in counting these prose-set lines as verse. There is some danger in not
          attending to these flow-overs. Eccles (ed. MM, 1980) does not note or comment
          on the two occurrences listed above, so a reader of his text would not know that verse is
          intended, and Spevack (ed. Ant., 1990) has the same failing at
          TLN 24–5.

        The following table lists the unindented flow-overs; the asterisk marks expanded
          spacing.

                430). The bottom five lines of the
              preceding column show signs of typographical squeezing, suggesting that the compositor
              had to fit more text into those lines than he had expected to, probably because,
              beginning at 430 and continuing to 504 on the next page, the scene is in
              stichomythic prose (except for the disguised rhymed couplet above) that may have
              proved difficult to cast off accurately. The quoted lines comprise a rhymed doggerel
              couplet plus five additional words. His overriding the couplet, in the context of
              other evidence of his having trouble with space on this page, suggests that the
              mistake is his, not something he set faithfully from his copy. It is also possible,
              however, that that couplet might have been thoroughly disguised in the midst of the
              staccato prose, and the rhyme inaudible—invisible—to him.

        The Printer’s Copy

        Commentators generally describe the text as an unusually good one. Knight (ed. 1842, p.
          125): This copy presents many typographical errors; and in a few passages the text
            is manifestly corrupt. The difficulties, however, are not very considerable; and the
            original copy is decidedly better, for the most part, than the modern innovations.
            Malone, in adhering to this text, was more distinctly opposed to Steevens than in other
            plays, in which he has, though evidently contrary to his own better opinion, adopted the
            suggestions of Steevens and others, who introduced what they considered amendments, but
            which amendments were founded upon an imperfect knowledge of the phraseology and metre
            of their author. The rejections by Malone of the changes of Steevens are here made with
            somewhat more of pertinacity, and perhaps of ill-temper, than was common with
            him. For an example of Malone’s ill-temper, see n. 585 (Sprights).

        Cuningham (ed.
          1907, p. xi) believes F was printed from Sh.’s MS. He notes that Err. has no names of the characters at the end as do three of the
          preceding plays, Tmp., TGV, and MM: We are left to conjecture the reason, which was probably
            sheer carelessness, if not too rapid work, on the part of the printers, and the want of
            any proper supervision; since there is ample room for the names on folio 100, the
            concluding page of the play. The lists of dramatis personae were probably
          provided by Ralph Crane.

        Approval of the text is borne out by listing the number of unquestioned or probable
          mistakes committed by the three compositors. Compositor C produces dittography at 20–1
            (any . . . any), at 154
            (helth . . . helth), and at 407 (did didst). He gets pronouns wrong at 126 (them for thee), 474 (them for probable men), and 750, 752 (your . . . your for her . . . her). He garbles 383 and 385–9
          so badly that no one can figure out how to emend. He sets vp for upon (105),
            backe for barke (119), too for two (320), hundred for thousand (338),
            trying for tyring (492), ruinate for ?ruinous (790), attaine
          for attaint (802),
            not for but (807), and do for you do (1243). The dittographs and the garbling probably result from
          his characteristically attempting to memorize too much (O’Connor, 1977, p. 60).

        Compositor D’s mistakes seem to be the result of misreading; his substitutions are
          orthographically similar to what he misreads, hence he is easier to emend
          than Compositor C (O’Connor, p. 61). His a riuall for arrival (166), cooke
          for clock[e] (231), adore for a’ door
            (285), thus for ill (286),
            stranger for stronger (569), free’d for offer’d
            (581), a name for an aim [= ame] (677), hope for trow (693), bud for ?bed (836), thee for them (836), when for
            where (844), and
            Thus for That (1160) look like careless work rather than difficulty with his
          copy. To these may be added God sake for ?God’s sake
            (258), sister for sister’s (833), and
            ships for ship (1218), all of which involve D’s characteristic trouble with
          initial and final -s (O’Connor, p. 67).

        Compositor B sets is for ?and (900), chalkle for chalkie
            (917), depth for death (1590). He makes a
          single pronoun mistake: their for her (999). Oh, for Of (1109) rounds out the errors that
          most editors emend.

        Other possible errors do not draw agreement that they are wrong: me by
            (1042), the first sir (1076), glanced it (1535), go (1895), and the second Natiuitie (1896) have all been defended; burthen
            are (1892) is a recognized problem,
          but whether it should read burdens are or burden
            ne’er is undecided. Like Compositor D, B sets God sake (1498), raising the possibility that both are
          authorial forms.

        Some mistaken punctuation occurs and, as I have shown, quite a lot of verse is set as
          prose. But the small number of errors, and especially of those that defy satisfactory
          emendation, confirms the repeated opinion that Err. is a good
          text. F2 emends 13 of the substantive mistakes in F1
          that most subsequent eds. adopt, and F3 emends 3 more. Of course, there
          may be hidden, unrecoverable errors the compositors made but that make such good sense
          that they are undetected. The Commentary discusses all the certain and possible
          errors.

        Until very recently, critics agreed that the play was set from Sh.’s
          autograph manuscript (foul papers), perhaps lightly annotated in the
          playhouse for performance purposes. But Werstine (1988, p. 244) advises caution: What then is
            the nature of the manuscript underlying the Folio text of Errors? This question, it seems to me, must go without an answer. His
          doubts are too recent to have influenced eds.

        Evidence that Sh.’s own hand lies close to the printer’s copy, if in fact that copy was
          not his manuscript, comes chiefly from the SDs and SPs. These have usually been
          characterized as too confusing to serve in a prompt-book; see, e.g., Evans (ed. 1974, p.
          104), and, in German, Tetzeli von Rosador (ed. 1982, pp. 11 f.). Werstine (1988, pp. 239–40) believes
          that the difficulties posed by the variations may be overstated. The following are the
          inconsistencies usually offered as evidence:

        Merchant of Siracusa (2), Marchant. (4), Mer. (30),
            Merch. (101) for
          Egeon in 1.1.; Mar. Fat. (1671), Fa. (1762, 1778, 1785, 1801, 1838), Fath. (1766, 1771, 1788), Father. (1775), Fat. (1783) in 5.1; it
          must be granted that the various Father SPs would not confuse
          anyone, and some may be compositorial.

        There is a failure to distinguish two Ephesian merchants, the first at 162, the second at 981.

        Enter Antipholis Erotes. . . . (162), Enter Antipholis Errotis (394). Erotes, Errotis are probably errors for Erraticus
          (wanderer). These are slightly misleading to a reader because they identify S. Antipholus, not his Ephesian brother. Antipholis is spelled this way by Compositor C only in a SD (394), but he spells Antipholus at 505 in dialogue. All but one—273—of the variations (162, 273, 394, 409, 786, 788) involving proper names occur in the work of Compositor C, as does the most
          serious garbling in the dialogue (383–9), so it is tempting to suppose that C had trouble
          reading his copy. But the -is spellings must have been in the
          printer’s copy, because both Compositors C and D had correctly set Antipholus in H3v–H4 and H3 when they started setting
          the play, before the -is spellings on H2v, H2, and H1v.

        Enter . . . Antipholis Sereptus (273–4). Sereptus
          is probably an error for Surreptus (snatched away). This is
          misleading for E. Antipholus. It is amusing that the garbled Latin
          should just reverse the initial letters of the twins’ designators, though of course only
          readers (including compositors) would have to deal with the problem, as in the next
          example.

        E. Ant. (409), rather
          than Ant., appears just once in 2.2. This is erroneous for S.
          Antipholus. Compositor C probably was influenced by Errotis as he
          noticed that S. Dro was being distinguished in the SPs.

        Enter Luce (679),
          Compositor D. She becomes Nell in dialogue (900, Compositor B) for the pun on her being an Ell and
            three quarters in girth (901).

        Enter Iuliana. . . . (786), SP Iulia (787) H4a, Compositor C; Compositor D correctly sets
            Luc. in column b. Eds. have thought that the mistake lay in the
          manuscript, possibly reflecting Sh.’s uncertainty about what to call her, but this is the
          first page of the typesetting of Err., and it is most likely that
          Compositor C misread his copy, whereas Compositor D got it right.

        Enter Angelo with the Chaine (955), with SP Ang. to his exit at 972, near the end of Act 3 (H4vb, Compositor B). Beginning at 981 (4.1) he is Goldsmith. His
          reappearance on stage after only eight lines following his exit is unusually soon in Sh.;
          I think it argues for a clearly marked pause in the action beyond what a scene ending
          might indicate. At the beginning of Act 3 (H3va, Compositor
          D), he enters as Angelo the Goldsmith, so the text is clear about
          his name and trade (that is, both are written down; the dialogue tells the audience the
          same facts). At the beginning of Act 4, Sh.—I suppose—chooses the term (Goldsmith) that he likes at the moment. Perhaps the shift from name to trade
          indicates a hiatus in the composition of the play?

        Curtizan (1227), Courtizan (1321, 1426) and Courtezan (1497) are given in SDs, but in SPs Curt. (1328) and Cur. (e.g., 1334). These
          are minor discrepancies that cause no trouble. The conclusion to be drawn is that
          printer’s copy was Sh.’s manuscript.

        Stage directions for entrances and exits are clear and reasonably complete. Some are
          indefinite or permissive directions, usually understood as indicating the author’s own
          hand in the manuscript; others are descriptive directions, usually understood as the
          author’s visualization of the action or else additions to the manuscript of performance
          activity. See Werstine (1988) for an analysis of the SDs that makes him skeptical that
          they can be used to identify with complete certainty just who is responsible for the
          wording; he quotes some of the extant dramatic MSS classified by Greg in 1931 (Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses vol. 2) under the anachronistic
          term promptbooks to show that there are unclear SDs in them,
          sometimes because theatrical personnel left authorial SDs unchanged.

        The indefinite directions include Enter the Duke of Ephesus, with the
            Merchant of Siracusa, Iaylor, and other attendants (2–3), where the last two words leave the
          casting up to the resources of the acting company. Likewise Enter
            Adriana, Luciana, Courtezan, &amp; others (1497), Enter . . . &amp; other
            Officers (1599–1601). Last, Exit one to the Abbesse (1761), where from a full stage—13 speaking
          characters plus others—there are plenty of people to draw from, but Sh. did
          not specify which one. Akin to these is Enter three or
            foure, and offer to binde him (1394),
          where the three or foure is permissive.

        Descriptive directions deal with props, stage action, and elaborations of characters’
          names (e.g., Angelo the Goldsmith, and Balthaser the Merchant—617–18), matters that
          strictly speaking affect the audience rather than the actor, who is supposed to know who
          he is, what to bring on stage, and what to do once there. One cannot be sure whether such
          directions derive from the author or are records of useful performance experience.

        Those involving props are Enter Angelo with the Chaine (955), followed three lines later by, loe
            here’s the chaine, and Enter Dromio Eph. with a ropes end
            (1288), followed by language making it clear
          what he bears. Both props have thematic importance, hence Sh. might be emphasizing them;
          yet the bag of coins S. Antipholus brings to Ephesus is likewise thematically important
          but is never denoted by a SD, as it might be at 170–1 (There is your monie that I had to keepe. Ant. Goe beare it to the Centaure, where we host). In 4.2,
          where S. Dromio goes to fetch a purse of money to pay his master’s debt,
          Enter Luciana (1178)
          might easily be completed, with the purse. Such lack of systematic
          identification of major, thematic props seems most likely to point to the author.

        
        As the play draws to its climax, stage action becomes hectic and the SDs grow more
          elaborate, beginning with Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him:
            Hee striues (1394–5). Enter Antipholus Siracusia with his Rapier
          drawne, and Dromio Sirac. (1440–1) marks the climax of S.
          Antipholus’s belief that he is besieged by malign forces he is determined to flee from. He
          and Dromio had exited at 1263 after the
          Courtesan approached him; in the meantime his brother had been bound and removed to a
          madhouse, so the armed entrance is all the more alarming to the characters who suppose the
          madmen are loose. The SD seems to say that only Antipholus is armed, but the dialogue,
          with its plurals, makes it clear that Dromio has a rapier as well.

        
        Their entrance precipitates the most perplexing direction in the play, Runne all out (1445) and (two lines
          later) Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted (1447). Such literary descriptions, common in play
          texts, are often regarded as evidence of the author’s own hand, but Chambers (1930, 1:306 f.) and Greg (1942; 1954, p.
          140, and 1955, p. 201) believe that Sh.’s foul papers were lightly annotated by a prompter
          or book-keeper, Greg pointing especially to Exeunt omnes as a
          book-keeper’s mistaken addition. Foakes (ed. 1962, pp. xiii ff.) argues against them: It
            is reasonable to suppose that a stage-direction was somehow duplicated at this point,
            but the ready and easy way of accounting for what happened, by invoking a prompter, is
            not very convincing. At first sight it looks plausible enough to argue, as W. W. Greg
            does, that Exeunt omnes was added by a prompter or book-keeper on the
            left of the manuscript page, so duplicating the author’s original direction on
              the right, and that the compositor [xiv] fitted them
            together in the printed text. He went on to say it is possible that the similar
                Exeunt omnes at [1898]
              was also an addition by the book-keeper. . . . 

        
          However, Greg does not seem to have realized that the direction at [1898] takes a common Shakespearian form, and is
            not at all analogous to the duplication at [1445, 1447]; it is in fact
            paralleled by the direction at [1426],
              Exeunt. Manet Offic. Adri. Luci. Courtizan. As for the duplication at
              [1665], this may well be a compositor’s
            careless expansion of what was in the manuscript—perhaps Enter E. Antipholus and
              E. Dromio. In other directions of this kind both characters are usually
            identified as of Syracuse or Ephesus, as at [1440–1], Enter Antipholus of Siracusia with his
              Rapier drawne, and Dromio Sirac., or [1811–12], Enter the Abbesse with Antipholus
              Siracusa, and Dromio Sir., and it may be conjectured that here the
            identification of Antipholus has been transferred to the end of the direction. The
            phrase a School-master, call’d Pinch, . . . is probably authorial, and
            Greg could not see why Chambers wanted to invoke a prompter to explain it; but the
            reason is, I think, clear enough, and it is the same reason that caused Greg to detect
            the intervention of a prompter at [1665] and
              [1898]. Both scholars wished to account
            for the split direction and duplication at [1445]; this could be plausibly explained by supposing that a prompter made an
            addition to the manuscript at this point; and this explanation would appear more
            convincing if the prompter’s hand could be found elsewhere.
        

        It was natural that, having discovered signs of the prompter, they should
            find him useful in elucidating other difficulties. However, there is no need to invoke
            him elsewhere than at [1445], and this
            passage deserves further scrutiny, to see whether an alternative explanation may not be
            just as satisfactory. The fact that the passage in F is split between the foot of one
            column and the top of another needs to be taken into account. He suggests that
          Sh. wrote a single direction in the right margin of his manuscript (p. xv), but
            divided it because of its length into two lines, Runne all out / as fast as may
              be, frighted, then, in the accident of printing, and of the division between
            columns, the direction was split into two and attached to different lines. If so, then
              Exeunt omnes could be the compositor’s addition to make sense of
              as fast as may be, frighted.
        
        

        What accident of printing he does not say, but perhaps he was thinking of
          how a compositor might discover, as he transferred his block of composed type from the
          setting stick to the forme, that he had set too much for column a, and had to improvise to
          start column b, thus separating what had been a comprehensible SD. But again, this
          procedure hardly accounts for the fact that Runne all out is set in
          the empty space left in column a to match the space in column b used for catchwords and
          signatures. Foakes
          is misleading when he says the passage in F is split at the foot of one column and
            the top of another, since foot means the last line of type
          normally used in a type page for text. Werstine (1988, p. 244) thinks the placement of Runne all out in the direction line is unique in F and continues:
            It would appear that Compositor B was ready to take extraordinary
            measures to avoid setting a marginal stage direction at the top of a column. For this
            reason, he would not have completed the direction begun at the bottom of column H6va
            with the top line of column H6vb. That is, if Foakes (and Greg) are right in believing
            that Shakespeare wrote only a single stage direction, it is probable that Compositor B
            would have split it in two to avoid the typographical blemish of a marginal stage
            direction beginning a column. . . . 

        My only reservation about Foakes’s account is the possibility that
            Shakespeare himself could have written both stage directions as they now stand.
                Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted
            closely resembles the following stage directions in the First Folio text of The Taming of the Shrew: Exit Biondello,
                Tranio and Pedant as fast as may be (TLN 2490), [likewise] thought to have been printed from [annotated foul
            papers]. In support of Sh.’s having written the SD is Compositor B’s preference
          for run, and the judgment that he sets runne
          under influence of his copy (Reid, 1976, p. 131).

        It may be noted that there is enough space in 1447 to fit in Runne all out with the rest of the
          direction. The line would then run the length of the type line, and look like the SD at
            1497 at the bottom of the same column, They draw. Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtezan, &amp; others. That
          setting would be a simpler or, if not simpler, a more conventional one than the
          extraordinary measure Compositor B took.

        Foakes concludes
          (p. xvi): It is unnecessary to introduce a prompter . . . to account for the
            peculiarities of this text; they may all be explained in terms of an author inattentive
            to petty details, a printer who added act-divisions, and compositors who solved an
            occasional puzzle as best they could. He does not explain on what principles a
          printer would provide act divisions, a very doubtful suggestion.

        Editors have been powerfully influenced by Greg (1942; 1954) and Idem (1955), e.g., Jorgensen (ed. 1964,
          p. 26), Kittredge
            &amp; Ribner (ed. 1966, p. xi), Wells (ed. 1972, p. 183), Bevington (ed. 1988,
          p. 76).

        Continuing with the descriptive SDs: They draw (1497), part of the action continuing from 4.4 into the
          beginning of Act 5, falls into the same category of literary authorial descriptions.
          Perhaps slightly different are Cry within (1657) and All gather to see them (1815). The first prompts Harke, harke, I
            heare him Mistris: flie, be gone (1658) and might indeed literally be a prompt inserted into the MS by Sh. or
          another, though it comes without warning to anyone holding the book, hence would be of
          little value as a backstage aid. The other direction, All gather to see
            them, comes when the Abbess brings S. Antipholus and S. Dromio out of the abbey to
          join their twins onstage for the first time. Such a clustering was inevitable, but the SD
          might mark a decision about how to block the climactic moment. Enter the
            Duke of Ephesus, and the Merchant of Siracuse bare head, with the Headsman, &amp; other
            Officers (1599–1601), has, in bare head, a phrase so thoroughly
          integrated into the large entrance as to make it very doubtful that it is not authorial;
          besides, the direction is indefinite. Beats Dro. occurs at 418, where it is not necessary (take thou
            that, &amp; that) and at 1327, but
          not at 1299, where it might be most needed
            (And to that end sir, I will welcome you). (Pope adds it.) E. Antipholus
          uses the newly provided rope at 1327
            (Wilt thou still talke?). Such randomness seems authorial, though not
          irrefutably so.

        Three directions apparently point to special staging effects, the use
          of three locales: the bay; the abbey; and the Porcupine, the Courtesan’s house. Enter Dromio Sira. from the Bay (1073) is oddly literary rather than theater-based, for of
          course it means from the stage door that conventionally in this play is used for
            characters coming into Ephesus from the water-front. Through that door, we may
          guess, enter S. Antipholus, S. Dromio, and the Merchant at the beginning of 1.2. Through
          it S. Dromio may depart when he is sent to find out if any vessel is available for
          escaping from Ephesus (937–45). If the inn called the Centaur is thought of as a seaside inn, Dromio
          goes through that door at 181, and his master
          and he use it at 1461. Enter
            Antipholus Ephes. Dromio from the Courtizans (995), and Exeunt to the Priorie (1503) are likewise literary, but they may mean that these
          locales were marked with signs. It is hard to imagine who but Sh. wrote those
          directions.

        Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe (1473). Chambers (1930, 1:307) and Greg (1955, p. 201) argue that againe means that the action is continuous from Act 4 to Act 5, hence
          that the act division is nonauthorial. Taylor (1993, p. 45 n.), arguing that F is printed from Sh.’s
          foul papers, thinks that the word indicates continuous writing rather than
            continuous performance and that the act divisions might well be authorial if the
          play were written specifically for Gray’s Inn.

        Finally, Enter Ladie Abbesse (1504) withholds the identity of Æmilia even from the first
          readers of the manuscript (and the audience) and from all subsequent ones. Sh. may, of
          course, be thinking of how the actor is to be costumed; or he may be thinking, as McKerrow (1935, p.
          465) argues, of her function as a peacemaker when she enters, especially as Sh. knows who
          she is. As with almost all the SDs, it is hard to imagine anyone but Sh. as being the
          author of this one.

        Only one SD perhaps calls for an entrance at the wrong place, and that probably by no
          more than a single line. Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him:
            Hee striues (1394–5) might be better placed, as with Foakes, after Adriana’s Oh binde him, binde him,
            let him not come neere me (1396–7).

        Unmarked exits occur at 361, 615 (Exeunt perhaps
          omitted by Compositor D who had to use the last line in column b for the catchword Actus), 1279, and 1581, a very small number compared with most
          plays. Editors have expanded some directions, especially in 3.1, where the staging of the
          locked-out husband is so puzzling.

        Err. was revived for presentation at court in 1604 (28 Dec.,
          Innocents’ Day); one would think, although there is no evidence that it was or was not
          played in the intervening years (though Meres names it in 1598), that a version of the play that has
          as many apparent puzzles in it as this version has could not serve the playhouse well.
          Recent scholarship, however, has made it clear that just such manuscripts did serve as
          prompt-books. It seems best to believe that the printers got Sh.’s autograph manuscript or
          a decidedly unmediated copy of it to set the Folio text. See also Werstine’s warning,  above.

        Wilson (ed. 1922,
          pp. 65–83) develops an elaborate theory of printer’s copy involving a transcriber (Hand A)
          in the playhouse who wrote out the play as it was dictated to him from assembled players’
          parts, i.e., the roles of paper containing only the lines a single
          character speaks. Wilson found evidence for such dictation-transcription in
            auditory misprints, mishearings in the course of transcribing, e.g.,
            vnhappie a (204) for unhappier, a name (677) for an aim, burthen
            are (1892) for burden ne’er, helpe (154) for health, crime (536) for grime. Another person (Hand B)
          added most of the SDs to that transcript, though he did not bother to read it but instead
          confidently put them in, relying on his memory of an earlier version of the play, the
          (nonextant) History of Error, recorded once in 1577, which Sh.
          adapted by sporadic rewriting. Wilson (ed. 1962, p. 65) abandons most of his theory, but he is
            still inclined, however, to take the normal spelling and
              auditory misprints as evidence that the actual copy for [F] was not
            Shakespeare’s autograph MS but a transcript therefrom, such a transcript as might have
            been made for the Gray’s Inn performance or for the printers of [F]. Misprints
          like these may be caused by compositors’ carrying words in their memories.

        Wilson’s
          reconstruction is elaborated by Gaw (Evolution, 1926), who posits an
          intermediate play between the 1577 History of Error and Err.; he thinks that the only plot element Sh. supplied beyond his
          sources was that involving Luciana.

        Baldwin (ed. 1928, p. 103) demolishes their theories, astutely objecting
          that the fundamental difficulty with the method of inconsistencies [listed above]
            is that it proves too much. That is, for every inconsistency there must be a
          fully developed solution that accounts for it alone. It is far simpler, he says, to make
          Sh. responsible for all the untidiness F exhibits, showing that Sh.’s known habits and the
          sources he relied on get rid of needlessly elaborate hypotheses.

      

    






    
      The Date of Composition

      Dating Err. precisely has proved too difficult
        to accomplish, though there is nearly universal agreement that it falls within the years
        1589 and 1594, the year of its presumed first recorded performance, and widespread agreement
        that it falls between 1592 and 1594. The most recent study of Sh.’s chronology, Wells &amp; Taylor’s (1987, p. 97), dates it 1594, associating it with LLL, R2, Rom., and
          MND, but the authors confess, Unfortunately, we still
          cannot discern with any confidence the chronological relationship between the items in each group.




      
        External Evidence




        
          
            Gesta Grayorum
          

          The first apparent written notice of Err. appears in Gesta Grayorum, an account of the Christmastide revels at Gray’s Inn
            in 1594. The Inn was a law school, one of several clustered together in London, that
            prepared young men for a career and offered them opportunities for recreation. One of
            these occasions took up the weeks between 20 Dec. 1594 and Shrovetide, the first three
            days in Feb. 1595; this extended party seems to have resulted from the long suspension
            of any revels, a hiatus caused by a bad siege of the plague from mid-1592 to spring
            1594.

          Though Gesta Grayorum was not printed until 1688, everyone
            since Malone
            (1780, 1:103) first drew attention to it has granted the authenticity and
            contemporaneity of the account, which in somewhat sophomoric language tells of the
            revels engaged in by the law students during that holiday season, intermitted by
              the space of three or four Years, by reason of Sickness and Discontinuances,
            i.e., nonattendance (ed. Bland, 1968, p. 5). (For a full analysis and quoting of the
            relevant text, see .) The members of Gray’s Inn invited students and guests
            of the Inner Temple, another law school, to join their revelry on Holy Innocents’ Day,
            28 Dec., but either because too many invitations were accepted or because of
            gate-crashing, Gray’s Inn hall became overcrowded and the planned entertainment was
            abandoned after the visiting Templarians left in a huff. As a substitution, a
              Comedy of Errors (like to Plautus his Menechmus) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and
              continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever
              afterwards called, The Night of Errors (Gesta Grayorum, ed. Bland, 1968, p. 32).

          The play is assumed to be Sh.’s. Malone himself (above) thought that
            the reference in Gesta Grayorum was not to Sh.’s play, but
              was probably a translation from Plautus.
            Gesta’s like to Plautus
            probably influenced this judgment. Those who propose that Sh. wrote the play on
            commission for the Gray’s Inn revels must explain, as none of them does, how to deal
            with the statement in Gesta Grayorum that it was only on or
            about 12 Dec. that the decision was made to have those revels (ed. Bland, 1968, p. 6),
            giving 16 days—and nights—to compose, learn, and rehearse The Comedy of
              Errors.

          Halliwell-Phillipps (1874, p. 31) discovered a payment to the
            Chamberlain’s men in the Chambers accounts dated 15 Mar. 1595 for performances of
            unspecified plays before the court at Greenwich on St. Stephen’s Day (26 Dec.) and Holy
            Innocents’ Day (see Chambers below). Fleay (1886, p. 125) notes that it is singular that
              the performance . . . should have also been performed apparently by the same company
              at Gray’s Inn, also on December 26th [sic]. It is unlikely that the
            Chamberlain’s men played Err. twice on the same night, even
            though the Gray’s Inn performance would have occurred very late, since the Templarians
            did not come to Gray’s Inn until about nine in the evening. Chambers (1923, 4:56) believes that
            the Chambers accounts are in error: Presumably the players of Shakespeare’s
                Comedy of Errors [at Gray’s Inn] were the Chamberlain’s
              men, and the Treasurer of the Chamber’s record . . . of a play at court by these men,
              as well as the Admiral’s, on 28 Dec. is a slip for 27 Dec., referring to his
            article Performances before Queen Elizabeth,
            MLR 2 (1906, pp. 10–11). Halliwell-Phillipps produces a line
            facsimile and Schoenbaum (1975, p. 136) has a photofacsimile of the entry
            authorizing payment; Sh. is here named for the first time as a member of the
            Chamberlain’s company.

          Thomas (1956, pp. 380–1) also thinks that the Gray’s Inn performance
            was the first, adducing especially the play’s brevity, simple staging, its
              perhaps . . . greater number of legal terms than any of Shakespeare’s other
              plays, and its (p. 381) successful attempt to outdo Plautine
              farce—qualities making Err. especially appropriate
            for the Gray’s Inn hall and audience.

        





        
          Meres’s Palladis Tamia and Late Dating

          The next reference to Err. comes in Francis Meres’s Palladis Tamia (S.R., 7 Sept. 1598; fol. 282r): As Plautus and Seneca
              are accounted the best for Comedy and Tragedy among the Latines: so Shakespeare among ye English is the most excellent
              in both kinds for the stage; for Comedy, witnes his
              Gẽtlemẽ of Verona, his Errors, his
                Loue labors lost, his Loue labours
                wonne, his Midsummers night dreame, &amp; his
                Merchant of Venice. Missing from this list (quoted
            here only in part) are versions of the H6 plays and Shr., plays dated earlier than the formation of the Lord
            Chamberlain’s men in mid-1594; they may not have been known as Sh.’s. But, if Meres
            intended to list all of Sh.’s plays to date, their not being named gives some added
            likelihood to the dating of Err. after 1592–3 when Pembroke’s
            men, who owned them, broke up.

          This list caused no comment when dating studies began because other commentators using
            internal allusions to contemporary events had already placed the composition of Err. well before 1598, including those who knew nothing about Gesta Grayorum with its 1594 date. For a brief time, however, a late
            chronology of the plays was postulated by Malone and Steevens, based on Sh.’s dedication of Ven. (1593) to the Earl of Southampton: But if the first
              heire [i.e., child, product] of my inuention proue deformed, I shall be sorie it had
              so noble a god-father.
            Malone (Attempt, in Steevens, ed. 1778, 1:292) lists Err. as number 12 in his chronology, dating it 1596, between Rom. and Ham. Malone’s discovery of the Gesta caused him to revise his chronology (ed. 1790, 1:266), dating
              Err. 1593, and in Boswell (ed. 1821, 2:295), changing the date to
            1592.

        





        
          
            The Gelyous Comodey
          

          Chambers (1923,
            2:123), on the repertory of Lord Strange’s men in the 26-day season of Dec.–Jan. 1592–3:
              In addition, there were a comedy called Cosmo, and two
              new plays, [one being] The Jealous Comedy, which may, I
              think, be The Comedy of Errors. A few pages later,
            writing about Pembroke’s men (2:130): He [Sh.] also wrote The
                Jealous Comedy or Comedy of Errors for
              Strange’s, a conjecture modified again (2:201): But they [the
              Chamberlain’s men] got The Jealous Comedy [from Strange’s
              men], if I am right in identifying it with The Comedy of
                Errors. He fills out his thinking in 1930 (1:310): The Comedy of Errors might quite well be the gelyous
                comodey produced as a new play by Strange’s men on 5 January
              1593. . . . I am not sure that it was not. Jealousy is a sufficiently prominent
              motive (ii. 2; iii. 1; iv. 2; v. 1) to justify such a description from the inexact pen
              of Henslowe [Henslowe’s Diary, ed. Foakes &amp; Rickert
              (1961), p. 19]. On the other hand, it is a prominent motive in many
            comedies.

        





        
          Lord Chamberlain’s Company, Founded 1594

          Baldwin (1927),
            and thereafter repeating his theory as a fact, says that the early comedies, including
              Err., require only a five-man cast to cover the major roles.
            What he does not deal with is the difference in cast size that, as Wells &amp; Taylor (1987, p. 95) say, separates the large number of dramatis
            personae of Shr., Tit., and 1–3 H6 from the smaller casts of most of the remaining plays:
              Noticeably, all five plays can be assigned, on reliable external evidence, to
              the period before 1594; all were performed, or at the very least might have been
              written in whole or part, before the closure of the theatres in mid-1592. Such large
              casts are also presumed in some other plays of this pre-plague period. . . . It
              therefore seems reasonable to suppose that these plays were written at a time when a
              playwright could count, as a matter of course, upon a company larger than the later
              Chamberlain’s men. This change in company structure cannot easily be dissociated from
              the devastating effects on the London acting profession of the long interregnum caused
              by plague.
            Err. can be played by 12 men and 4 boys (see ), a number that
            accords better with the smaller Chamberlain’s company than with the larger earlier
            company. (All the comedies, however, have fewer dramatis personae than the histories or
            tragedies.)

          Alexander
            (1929, pp. 196–7) makes an important argument based on the plague of mid–1592 to
            mid-1594: The central fact round which the fragmentary information of
              Shakespeare’s early career in London must be arranged is the Plague of
              1592–[4]. . . . It is a safe conjecture . . . that the plays they [the actors] took
              into the provinces in 1592 they brought back again without additions to their number:
              a company on tour would have no need or desire to commission new work. Hence
            the plays known to have been presented just after the return to London must predate the
            plague.

          
            The plays . . . which may on these grounds be dated before midsummer 1592 are:
                [Err., Shr., Tit., (197) 1–3 H6, and
              perhaps an early version of Ham.].
          

        





        
          Earlier Time for Beginning Performances

          Tetzeli von
                Rosador (1980, and ed. 1982, p. 18) sees the specific references to
            clock time (two o’clock: 277; five o’clock: 189, 991, 1587) as particularly apt in 1594
            when, on 8 Oct., the Lord Chamberlain assured the Lord Mayor (see Chambers, 1923, 4:316) that his
            players, who used to begin plays towardes fower a clock, . . . will now begin at
              two, &amp; haue done betwene fower and fiue, thus settling—at least for his
            company—a decade-long complaint that plays interfered with Evening Prayer and also
            released crowds into the streets after dark. Whatever Egeon’s fate, the audience
              will be able to reach home during daylight. Thus The Comedy of
                Errors offers the City Fathers a dramatic model of faithful adherence to
              their demands and the audience some knowing amusement (1980, p. 348). If this
            is true, it means Sh. had only about two months to write the play before the 28 Dec.
            performance at Gray’s Inn—unless he inserted the clock times into an already written
            play, as he could without disturbing anything else.

        





        
          Relation to Other Works

          For the possibility that Sh. depended on Warner’s translation of Menaechmi, printed in 1595, see .
            For the influence of Gascoigne’s Supposes (1566; pr. 1573), a
            source for Shr., see , .

          Malone (1780,
            1:76) first associates the passages of abab rhymes (786–839, 1104–9) with LLL, TGV, MND, and
              Rom.; he supposes that Sh. had written no plays before Ven. (1593) and Luc. (1594): The
              measure that he had first used in these poems, naturally presented itself to him in
              his first dramatick essays. Subsequent chronologies that call for dating some
            or all of these plays before the printing of Ven. must by this
            logic either date the composition of Ven. even earlier or see
            the elegant Ven. stanza as the product of Sh.’s precedent
            dramatic efforts or other literary models. Hyder Rollins (ed., The
              Poems, 1938, pp. 384–90), summarizes speculation about the date of composition
            of Ven., ranging from 1580 to 1593, without settling the
            question.

          Uhlig (1968, pp. 450–5) sees a thematic notion repeated in Ven., R3, and Err.
            that opposes lust and love, the former leading to loss of identity, the latter to
            self-discovery and integration. The verbal similarities used to express this notion are
            so nearly identical that he thinks Err. was probably composed
            soon after Ven. (1592) and R3 (1592–3,
            Uhlig following Chambers’s chronology)—after because, he says, only
              Err. moves from how lust and self-hate confuse identity to
            the idea that love produces self-discovery.

          Wells &amp; Taylor (1987, p. 95) observe that the plays likely to have
            been written before the onset of the plague in 1592—in their chronology, TGV, Shr., 2, 3 H6,
              1H6, Tit., and R3—have less
            rhyme than those probably written just after the theaters opened in 1594: What
              causes the sudden increase in the use of rhyme? Apparently, the event which
              immediately precedes that increase is the composition of the 1,194 rhymed lines of
                Venus and Adonis, followed within the year by composition
              of the 1,855 rhymed lines of Lucrece; at about the same time
              Shakespeare probably began writing large numbers of rhymed sonnets. No other
              explanation so readily and naturally accounts for Shakespeare’s fondness for rhyme in
              comedies, histories, and tragedies, all most probably dating from the years
              1594–5.

          Knight (ed.
            1842, pp. 127–8) also comments on this rhyme pattern as a sign of early composition.

          Isaac (1884, p. 234) dates Err. in 1589 on
            the basis of parallels with sonnets of Sh.’s first youthful sonnet
              period. Since he places Tit., Per., and 1H6 in 1586–8, his opinion does not
            command much interest.

          Sarrazin (1897, p. 109) compares A league from Epidamium had we saild (65) with a reading in Robert Greene and Thomas Lodge’s A Looking Glasse for London and England (pr. 1594, but dating from
            about 1589), 1322–6: Scarce had we gone ten leagues from sight of land
            when a storm rose, obscuring the sun as in Err.
            65–71; he supposes
            that Sh. adapted the passage. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, p. 241):
              I do not see how Shakspere could have arrived at this phraseological and
              structural result if the lines from Looking Glasse had not
              stuck in his head. If the lines had stuck, one may readily suspect also that the
                ten leagues from sight of land then betrayed Shakspere into the
              much-criticized ere the ships could meet by twice fiue leagues ([103]) as the limits of sight at
              sea. . . . The supposition is that Shakspere heard the play before he wrote this
              passage in Errors. If so, Shakspere’s passage is not earlier
              than 1589, late in the year rather than early.

          Baldwin
              (Genetics, 1965, p. 14): These chalkle
                Cliffes [he uses F’s misprinted form] of Dromio are from a significant
              source, deriving as they do from Peele’s Farewell to the
              counter-Armada, so not earlier than February, 1589, and probably at least a few weeks
              later. He refers, without quoting, to A farewell. Entituled to the
              famous generalls of our English forces: Sir J. Norris &amp; Syr F. Drake
              (STC 19537; in Peele, Works, ed.
            Bullen, 1888, 2:237): Have done with care, my hearts! aboard amain With
              stretching sails to plough the swelling waves: Bid England’s shore and Albion’s chalky
              cliffs Farewell. Baldwin (p. 228) elaborates Sh.’s dependence on Peele by
            calling the two words Such a jewel and finds Thomas Lodge using them as
            early as 22 Sept. 1589 in Scilla’s Metamorphosis (The
              Pithie and Most Pleasant Historie of Glaucus and Silla, line 392), he too
            having taken them from Peele. The phrase first appears recorded in poetry in line 180 of
            Thomas Blenerhasset’s A Reuelation of the True Minerua (1582);
            it also occurs in Richard Johnson’s Musarum Plangores (1591),
            line 80. Delius
            (ed. 1858) first observes chalky cliffs in 2H6 3.2.101 (1801), usually dated 1590–1. Hart (ed. 2H6, 1909) cites the phrase in The Farewell
            and in The Old Wives Tale (?1588–94; pr. 1595):
              Shakespeare is indebted to Peele here.

          Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, p. 25) finds a
            borrowing from Err. in A Knack to Know a
              Knave, played by Strange’s men beginning on 10 June 1592: The Bailiefe
              here hath arested me ere I was weary against my will: he said it was vpon your suit,
              &amp; yet he laid his hands on me, Nay more, on my shoulder (ed. Proudfoot,
            1964, D3v [Baldwin quotes Hazlitt, 1874–6, 6:547]). Err. has I know not at whose suite he is arested well
              (1154) and the man sir, that when
              gentlemen are tired giues them a sob [= rest], and rests them (1207–8).

          Knack is a magpie’s collection of unconsidered trifles.
            Proudfoot lists parallels in Lyly, Greene, Marlowe, Shr. and
              A Shrew, A Looking Glasse for London and
              England, Jack Straw, and others, but not this
            collocation from Err., though he grants that his list is not
            exhaustive (pp. vi f.). It would be impossible to say which borrowed from which, if
            borrowing is involved; the lines sound to me like a standard comic routine (e.g., Mother Bombie, ?1590; pr. 1594, 4.2.165: Serg[eant] . . . I arest you. Dro. Me, sir! why then didst not bring a stoole wyth thee, that I might sit
              downe?), unified into one sentence in Knack but
            separated by some 50 lines in Err. Nevertheless, the author of
              Knack is a convicted borrower of many men’s words; if he took
            these of Sh., Err. dates earlier than June 1592.

          Wilson (ed. 1922) notes the similarity of Heart and good will
              you might, But surely Master not a ragge of Monie (1373–4) to heart and good will,
              but neuer a ragge of money in Nashe, Foure Letters
              Confuted (1592; ed. McKerrow, 1905, 1:301): The parallel, hitherto
              unnoticed we believe, is remarkable and unless both writers are quoting from some
              common source, we must suppose that Nashe was borrowing from Shakespeare. Cf.
              McKerrow, Nashe, i. 271–2: I borrowed this sentence
                out of a Play. The Theater, Poets hall, hath many more such prouerbes
              etc.
            Baldwin (ed.
            1928) finds an earlier, if not the common, source, asserting that Nashe was copying Sh.:
              But there is a still earlier variant of the expression than Nashe’s. In Thomas
              Lodge’s Deafe Man’s Dialoge (S.R., February 17, 1592; but if
              really by Lodge, written before August 26, 1591), when Lodge set sail with
            Cavendish on a circumnavigation of the globe, we find . . . neuer a ragge
                of money. Baldwin, convinced that Err.
            dates from 1589, does not really care whether Sh. invented the saying or
            carefully adapted it; the Lodge and Nashe passages are after 1589.

          Turner (1974, p. 13) compares 729–40 with 1H6 1.3.7–12 (366–71), where Gloucester is refused entrance to the
            Tower, and then (p. 257 n.): This suggests that the composition of Errors precedes the chronicle play. Such an ordering makes more
              sense than one which assumes that Shakespeare first devised a brief knocking at the
              gate in 1 Henry VI and then, when composing Errors, searched outside his major source, The
                Menaechmi, for an episode to serve as a model for a very similar
              dialogue. His chronology places these two plays as the first Sh. wrote, in
            about 1588–90 (p. 7).

          Foakes (ed.
            1962, p. xix): [There is] the apparent echo of Marlowe’s play, Edward II (?1591–2) in the phrase, What, will you murder me?
                ([1400]), which is spoken also by King
              Edward, and in the business of burning Pinch’s beard, and quenching it in
                puddled mire ([1646]). In
              Marlowe’s play the King’s face is washed in puddle-water, his beard is shaved off, and
              he speaks of standing in mire and puddle. (See Brooks below;
            Foakes credits him with first noticing the echo.)

          Brooks (1968,
            pp. 76 ff.), in a little-noticed essay, believes that Marlowe’s Edward
              II is influenced by R3, and that Err. echoes Marlowe at 1400 and
              1643–6. (P. 78):
              No one doubts that Edward II came late in Marlowe’s
              career, cut short on about 30 May 1593. His career in the drama perhaps did not
              continue beyond January, when The Massacre at Paris was
                ne [= new?] for Henslowe. During the rest of his life, the theatres
              were closed because of plague; one imagines him working at Hero and
                Leander rather than for the paralysed London stage. . . . If Doctor Faustus also belongs to 1592 . . . there is not much room
              for Edward II later than spring of that year. A date then of
              very late 1591 would fit the influence upon Marlowe’s play of Shakespeare’s
                tetralogy. . . . [79] Shakespeare’s indebtedness [at Err.
              1400, 1643–6] provides a valuable check on
              the earliest date for the Comedy; and as there is a good
              though not watertight case for actually placing the Comedy
              late in 1592, it harmonises with our hypothesis of 1592 or at the end of 1591 for
                Edward II. He dates R3 in
            1591, a bit earlier than most other chronologies.

          Gaw (Evolution, 1926, p. 648): The unusually large number of
              parallel passages connecting the Errors with the Two Gentlemen of Verona . . . tends strongly to associate these
              two plays, and to separate them from Love’s Labour’s
              Lost. He believes that Sh. revised an earlier Err. and dates the revision between early 1592 and the end of that
              year. In a note on that page he collects the parallels found scattered in Wilson (ed.
            1922).

          Foakes (ed.
            1962, pp. xxii f.): The play has particular links also with two other plays. One
              is Love’s Labour’s Lost, which is set at the court of the
              King of Navarre, and is generally thought to have been written when Henry of Navarre
              was engaged in civil war with the support of the English government and forces, that
              is, between 1591 and November 1593, when support for him was withdrawn on his becoming
              a Roman Catholic. This play, however, has its own dating problems, for it seems to
              refer to the Gray’s Inn Revels of Christmas 1594, in which, as in the play, there
              appears a mock-embassy of Russians, and also shows signs of a later revision. The play
              which has the closest links with The Comedy of Errors is
                The Two Gentlemen of Verona; there are many phrases, jests,
              and relatively unusual words, such as hapless,
              timeless,
              overshoes,
              minion,
              peevish,
              ruin­[xxiii]ous, and peasant
              (used of a servant) common to the two plays, and the vexing dialogue of
              the clowns, Launce and Speed, has connections with, and is similar in kind to, that of
              the Dromios, notably in such passages as the mock-inventory of the virtues of Launce’s
                mistress. . . . The Taming of the Shrew has in common with
              these plays a use of doggerel couplets, and has connections with The
                Comedy of Errors both in the theme of the shrewish wife, Katherina, who is a
              type similar to Adriana, and in its indebtedness to George Gascoigne’s Supposes (1566) for many details; Shakespeare seems to have known
              this play of errors and mistaken identities when he wrote his own play of
              errors. But dating TGV and Shr. is likewise difficult.

          
            These linkages tend to reinforce the supposition that The Comedy
                of Errors was written not long before or immediately after the long spell of
              plague which caused all acting to be prohibited in London throughout most
              of . . . 1593. . . . It is not possible to be more conclusive than this.
          

          Edward Jacob, in his ed. of Arden of Faversham (1770, p. vi),
            remarks on the similarity between the description of Doctor Pinch and that of one Jack
            Fitten, who does not appear in the play but is described. Pinch is a hungry
              leane-fac’d Villaine; A meere Anatomie, a Mountebanke, A thred-bare Iugler, and a
              Fortune-teller, A needy-hollow-ey’d-sharpe-looking-wretch (1714–17); Fitten is A
              lean-faced, writhen knave, Hawk-nosed and very hollow-eyed, With mighty furrows in his
              stormy brows, Long hair down his shoulders curled; His chin was bare, but on his upper
              lip A mutchado, which he wound about his ear (ed. Martin H. Wine, 1973,
            2.47–52). Both are leane-fac’d and hollow-ey’d; but the
            dating of Arden is as doubtful as that of Err. Wine guesses 1587–92, with a half-confident assertion in limiting
                Arden to 1588–91 (p. xlv). Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, pp. 18–22), canvassing all the possible combinations of
            influence, concludes that Arden borrows from Err. But as Wine says in his note on lines 47–52, Such descriptions of
              villains . . . had come to fit an iconographic pattern, e.g., the description
            of Pilia-Borza in Marlowe’s Jew of Malta, 4.2.28.

        





        
          Topical Allusions

          Sarrazin (1897,
            pp. 101–2) thinks that Doctor Pinch, the only character in the whole play who bears an
            English name, would make Shakespeare and the English public think of
              Doctor (really only M.A.) John Dee (1527–1608), a famous English
            alchemist and exorcist who lived in very straitened circumstances. Dee returned to
            England in Dec. 1589 after a long residence on the Continent and could not easily have
            entered Shakespeare’s observation before 1590. No one has been persuaded by Sarrazin’s
            suggestion; the lack of similarity is too great.

          Theobald (letter to Warburton, 29 Nov. 1729, in Nichols, 1817, 2:295) first
            suggests that S. Dromio’s description of the kitchen wench Nell, a satirical association
            of her body with countries in Europe, Ireland, and Scotland (905–28), could include a reference to
            the difficulty which Henri of Navarre experienced in attaining the French throne owing
            to his being a Protestant; he was opposed by the Catholic League, which forced him into
            exhausting and inconclusive warfare, chiefly in Normandy and Brittany, for several years
            after he was named heir to the throne following Henri III’s assassination on 2 Aug.
            1589. He eventually ascended the throne in July 1593, having converted to Roman
            Catholicism after his supposed bon mot, Paris is worth a Mass. In the
            geographical itemization, Dromio says he found France in Nell’s forhead, arm’d
              and reuerted, making warre against her heire (914–15). Theobald asks, Is there
              any equivocal joke here aimd at betwixt hair and heir? You know the stir about that time in France, to exclude
              Navarre from the Crown; and that Queen Elizabeth sent forces in aid of his
              cause.

          Chalmers (1799,
            pp. 275–6): In 1591, Queen Elizabeth sent Lord Essex with four thousand men, to
              assist [276] Henry IV. . . . This is a remarkable fact, which
              fixes the allusion to 1591.

          Elizabeth indeed sent forces to help Henri, the best-known expedition being led by
            Essex in July 1591; it caused a great stir in England at its onset, but interest
            dwindled away until Essex’s final return to England in Jan. 1592 (Cheyney, 1914, 1:251–76).

          For many years commentators repeated the substance of Theobald’s letter and his
            elaboration of it in ed. 1733 (see n. 913–15), dating the play 1589–93, the years when Henri was the uncrowned
              heir. Then Simpson (1870, p. 38) raised the question of just when Navarre could
            have been considered heir, proposing that Henri was heir between 1584, at
            the death of the Duke of Anjou, next in line to the throne, and 1589 when he became de
            facto king: During the heredity of Henry of Navarre France was reverted, or in
              reversion, because her crown descended to a new line on the proximate extinction of
              the house of Valois. She began to arm for war against her heir in April 1585, when the
              declaration of the League was made. She was in the thick of the war in 1587, when the
              League fought and lost the great battle of Coutras. In April 1589, Henry III. and
              Henry of Navarre met as friends in Plessis-les-Tours. This indication therefore fixes
              the first production of The Comedy of Errors in the period
              between April 1585 and April 1589.
            Smart (1928, pp.
            206–7) and Alexander (1929, p. 198), Smart’s student, repeat the substance of
            Simpson’s argument without acknowledging or perhaps knowing of his precedence.

          Foakes (ed.
            1962, pp. xx f.) warns that depending on history-book dates for the
            French civil war is dangerous because they ignore contemporary documents that do not
            limit themselves to 1589–93: In a letter of 1589, published by Henry of Navarre,
              and translated at once into English, he discusses events since December 1588, saying,
                this foure yeares space I have beene the argument of the tragœdies of
                France . . . the subject of civile armes. [fn.: A Letter
                written by the King of Navarr (1589; dated at the end, 4 March 1589), A3r. Compare A Caveat for France
              (1588), A2r, These three yeares and more hath France ben tormented with this war. . . .  In this
              text the beginning of the war is set in March 1585.] Similarly, the [xxi] upper limit, 1593, seems not to have been regarded at the time as marking
              more than a truce, and it has recently been shown that as late as 1597 writers in
              England were referring to the civil war as still in full swing.

          Dromio’s description of Nell (905–28) offers other phrases for topical dating. Asking
            where Dromio found America, the Indies, S. Dromio replies,
              Oh sir, vpon her nose, all ore embellished with Rubies, Carbuncles, Saphires,
              declining their rich Aspect to the hot breath of Spaine, who sent whole Armadoes of
              Carrects to be ballast at her nose (923–6).

          Delius (ed. 1858) takes the sensible position that this refers to the
            protected treasure convoys plying between America and Spain, but others, beginning with
              Malone (in
              Boswell, ed.
            1821), glossing hot breath, think the reference is to the Armada
            of 1588, helping to settle the terminus a
              quo; so Cuningham (ed. 1907, p. xvii) and Wilson (ed. 1922, pp. x–xi). Baldwin (ed.
            1928) has it both ways: The reference . . . is an echo of events following the
              Great Armada; hence not earlier than July, 1588. Spain is said allusively to be
              sending armadas of ships to America and the Indies to be loaded with
            riches.

          Fripp (1938,
            1:299–301): Carrects alludes to a specific treasure ship, the Madre de Dios, which had been captured and brought to Dartmouth in
            early Sept. 1592. Halliwell (ed. 1854) describes the ship but makes no identification
            for dating purposes. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, pp. 15–16) denies
            Fripp’s proposal on the grounds that the plural Armadoes of Carrects
              (925–6) does not fit
            a single ship. Foakes (ed. 1962, gloss on 925–6) is noncommittal: Shakespeare may have had
              the great Armada of 1588 in mind . . . or possibly the Great Carrack, the Madre de Dios.

          A supposed identification of Sh. with pleasant Willy, spoken of in Spenser, Tears of the
              Muses, ll. 205–22 (Complaints, 1591; Tears may have been written in 1578–80 or in 1589–90), is accepted by those
            who believe the poem dates close to 1591; by those who favor a chronology of his plays,
            including Err., beginning in the 1580s; and by those who
            believe that the epithets pleasant and gentle must apply,
            as Rowe says,
            only to Sh. So Malone (ed. 1790, 1.2:174–6), Knight (ed. 1842, 1:xxxvii), and Honigmann (1985, pp. 71–6). Rowe (ed. 1709,
            1:xi–xii), quoting Spenser: 
                
                  And he the Man, whom Nature’s self had made
                  To mock her self, and Truth to imitate
                  With kindly Counter under mimick Shade,
                  Our pleasant Willy, ah! is dead of late:
                  With whom all Joy and jolly Merriment
                  Is also deaded, and in Dolor drent.
                 
                  Instead thereof, scoffing Scurrility
                  And scorning Folly with Contempt is crept,
                  Rolling in Rhimes of shameless Ribaudry,
                  Without Regard or due Decorum kept;
                  Each idle Wit at will presumes to make,
                  And doth the Learned’s Task upon him take.
                 
                  But that same gentle Spirit, from whose Pen
                  Large Streams of Honey and sweet Nectar flow,
                  Scorning the Boldness of such base-born Men,
                  Which dare their Follies forth so rashly throw;
                  Doth rather choose to sit in idle Cell,
                  Than so himself to Mockery to sell.
                
               Rowe goes on: I know some People have been of Opinion, that Shakespear is not meant by Willy . . . because Spencer’s Death happen’d twenty
              Years before Shakespear’s. But, besides that the Character is
              not applicable to any Man of that time but himself, it is plain by the last Stanza that Mr. Spencer does not mean that
              he was then really Dead, but only that he had with-drawn himself from the Publick, or
              at least with-held his Hand from Writing, out of a disgust he had taken at the then
              ill taste of the Town, and the mean Condition of the Stage. Mr. Dryden was always of Opinion these Verses were meant of Shakespear; and ’tis highly probable they were so, since he was three and
              thirty Years old at Spencer’s Death; and his Reputation in
              Poetry must have been great enough before that Time to have deserv’d what is here said
              of him. Knight points to the trouble the players were getting into by the
              introduction of matters connected with religion and politics, referring
            to Lord Burghley’s instruction (autumn 1589) to Lord Mayor Sir John Harte to close down
            the theaters in the city until the players reformed their repertories (Chambers, 1923,
            4:305–7).

          Chambers (1930,
            1:22): A supposed . . . allusion to him as Willy . . . is now, I
              think, universally rejected, a hope disappointed by Honigmann’s acceptance; see also
              ibid. (2:186).

          Schoenbaum
            (1970, p. 132): It would remain for twentieth-century scholarship to associate
              Willy . . . with Richard Wills or Willey, the learned author of De
                Re Poetica, who died around 1579.

          Chalmers (1799,
            pp. 274–80) reviews up to 1799 the attempts to date the play, adding new evidence about
            trade wars in 1589–91 that might be connected to Egeon’s being sentenced to death. (P.
            278): These allusions to the rivality of trade are so particularly marked, as to
              relate, plainly, to the commercial transactions of that eventful period. In 1589,
              Queen Elizabeth seized sixty ships, belonging to the Hans Towns, which were carrying
              warlike stores to Spain. In 1590, the Hollanders complained of the English
              depradations on their trade. In 1591, there were commercial complaints between England
              and Denmark. In this year, the English merchant-adventurers were expelled from
              Staaden; but were favoured by Elbing: Here, then, are the adverse
                towns [19], which are so
              emphatically mentioned by Shakspeare. Add to those applicable facts, that the Lord
              Admiral was commanded, in July, 1591, to arrest all Hamburgh
              ships, and [279] goods, for satisfaction of four hundred and
              sixty pounds to George Leate. These were all very striking events to a commercial
              city, which, when mentioned by the poet, must have been felt by the inhabitants of
              London: And, those facts, when coupled with the allusion to the repugnance of France
              to Henry IV, fix the time, when this Comedy of Errors was written, to
            1591.

          Barton (1929,
            p. 64) finds an allusion to a contemporary scandal involving a gold chain: Chief
              Baron Manwood was the central figure of a sensational case about a gold chain which
              made a great stir in the Star Chamber in the years 1591–1592. Hearing that his son had
              disposed of a gold chain to a goldsmith named Underwood, he sent for the goldsmith and
              terrified him into handing over the chain, which he put into his pocket and refused to
              give back. The goldsmith complained to the Star Chamber, with the result that the
              episode made a noise in Westminster Hall, of which the Comedy of
                Errors is supposed by some commentators to have contained an
            echo.

          Fripp (1938,
            1:318–20) quotes extensively from the Acts of the Privy
            Council, dating the termini of the incident 1590–May 1592. Both he and Barton think that
            the lawyers and law students would have been amused by the allusion to a contemporary
            event; Fripp (p. 320) widens the interest to any one acquainted with judicial or
              court gossip. Few have followed this line of allusion, nor have I found the
              commentators Barton speaks of.

          Wentersdorf (1951, p. 167), remarking on the crudeness of the
              piece, refers to a document of Dec. 1590 [that] reveals that the affair
              began with the loan of the gold chain about two years since. Presumably
              the scandal was already the talk of the town in the winter of 1589–90. The
            words he quotes are from the Acts, dated 30 Nov. 1590. He dates
              Err. 1589–90.

          Baldwin (ed. 1928, pp. xiv f.), on the basis of lines 1588–91, believes that
            Sh. was referring to the topography of Holywell Priory, a Benedictine nunnery near the
            Curtain and the Theater, where both Lord Strange’s men and the Admiral’s men were
            performing late in 1589: Thus it would appear that this allusion [1588–91] was written
              for a performance at one of these buildings. If so, the whole conclusion of the play,
              centering as it does around the Priory, was written for this performance. . . . We
              should [xv] thus on this evidence date the planning and
              completion of the fifth act as not earlier than November 5, 1589, when
            Strange’s men apparently had to move to the Curtain from the Cross Keys Inn, nor
              later than November, 1590, which again confirms our date of Christmas
              1589–1590.
            Idem (1931, pp.
            129 f.) goes on to say that Sh. witnessed the hanging of a seminary priest, William
            Hartley, on 5 Oct. 1588, from a gallows erected at Holywell, near the Theater, and based
            Egeon on Hartley. Furthermore, Solinus bears some traits of Sheriff Hugh Offley, who
            presided at the execution: In life, we have two men opposed, Sheriff Hugh Offley,
              and the priest William Hartley . . . as in the picture we have Duke Solinus, and
              Aegeon. Duke Solinus of Ephesus was engaged in a mercantile warfare. Likewise, Master
              Sheriff Offley, a merchant of London, was accustomed to act the prince [he played
              Prince Arthur in archery shows in the late 1580s], was at the time considered a London
              champion against Spain, and was prominently engaged in a mercantile warfare which had
              grown out of the struggle with that country. Aegeon was a hapless victim of the
              mercantile warfare, with whom Solinus sympathized, but whom he could not alter the law
              to save. As a merchant of souls (a frequent figure with priests generally), Hartley
              was the hapless victim of the warfare, both mercantile and religious, with Spain. Him
              too Offley pitied; but could [130] not alter the law to save.
              In age and dignified bearing, the two sets of characters are alike.

          McManaway
            (1950, p. 24) rejects Baldwin’s (1931) belief that Sh. utilized his
              impressions of Hartley’s hanging (see above) for the Egeon story to compose
            the play in 1589. It seems to me entirely possible that Shakespeare could have
              recalled the circumstances of Hartley’s death as late as 1592 or 1593, and I find it
              difficult to believe that the gentlemen of Gray’s Inn would have entertained their
              guests on a grand night in 1594 with a play staled by five years on the public
              stage.
            Staled by five years on the public stage is a little misleading, since
            the playhouses were closed between 23 June 1592 and about May 1594 because of the
            plague. McManaway incorrectly dates the second recorded performance 1598 rather than
            1604; he is probably thinking of Meres’s list (see ).

          Axton (1977,
            pp. 80 ff.) suggests that Err. formed one of a series of
            political advice plays peculiar to Inns of Court, and that Err.
            was perhaps written specifically for the 1594 Gray’s Inn revels. The topic to be
            addressed was the need to unify Scotland and England, something Elizabeth resisted:
              The revels of 1594/5 and Shakespeare’s Comedy of
                Errors manifest their authors’ [plural because she includes the Gesta] awareness of the specific political implications of such
              general moral and religious language, i.e., Eph.
              2:12–16, which speaks about unifying Gentile and Jew in Christ.

          (P. 81): The Gray’s Inn knights of the helmet might well have seen Shakespeare’s
              play and written a revels fiction with similar themes or they may have commissioned
              his play specially for the occasion. She remains agnostic, however, about
            whether Sh. wrote the play for the revels.

        

      






      
        Internal Evidence



        
          Doggerel

          An aspect of the verse, the doggerel (629–744, 1136–77), confirms early commentators in dating Err. among Sh.’s earliest plays. Doggerel (often spelled doggrel or dogrel), a word of unknown origin
            but associated pejoratively by OED with dog (a.: An epithet applied to comic or burlesque verse; or to
              mean, trivial, or undignified verse), was the chief medium for comic verse in
            the drama before the 1580s, after which prose influenced by Lyly took over for a while.
            Most of the doggerel in Err. occurs in 3.1 when E. Antipholus
            tries to enter his house for dinner with Angelo and Balthasar but is blocked by S.
            Dromio. Actually the doggerel begins at 629
            and is so powerful that it draws all the speakers to it instead of being restricted, as
            one would expect, to the Dromios. It ends, after a transitional rhymed iambic couplet,
            with a return to blank verse at 747. Blackstone (in Malone, 1780,
            1:103): I suspect this and all other plays where much rhime is used, and
              especially in long hobbling verses, to have been among Shakspeare’s more early
              productions.
            Malone (ed. 1790,
            2:203 n.) fleshes out the point: The long doggrel verses that Shakspeare has
              attributed . . . to the two Dromios, are written in that kind of metre which was
              usually attributed by the dramatick poets before his time, in their comick pieces, to
              some of their inferior characters; and this circumstance is one of many that authorize
              us to place [Err. with LLL and
                Shr.] (where the same kind of versification is likewise
              found), among our author’s earliest productions; composed probably at a time when he
              was imperceptibly infected with the prevailing mode, and before he had completely
              learned to deviate boldly from the common track. Examples in
            these early plays are LLL 2.1.194 ff.
              (692 ff.), Shr. 1.2.11 ff. (576
              ff.), TGV 2.1.133–6
              (528–32).

          The notion that Sh. could write such mean, trivial, or undignified verse
            brought opposition. Ritson (in Steevens, ed. 1793) objects to Blackstone. Malone’s note above is not acknowledged,
            perhaps because of a falling out between Steevens and Malone, and because of Ritson’s
            animosity toward Malone): I have much doubt whether any of these long
                hobbling verses have the honour of proceeding from his pen; and, in fact,
              the superior elegance and harmony of his language is no less distinguishable in his
              earliest than his latest production. The truth is if any inference can be drawn from
              the most striking dissimilarity of stile, a tissue as different as silk and worsted,
              that this comedy though boasting the embellishments of our author’s genius, in
              additional words, lines, speeches, and scenes, was not originally his, but proceeded
              from some inferior playwright, who was capable of reading the Menæchmi without the help of a translation, or, at least, did not make use
              of Warner’s.

          Critics who for various reasons think that Sh. adapted an earlier
            but not extant play (see ) point to the doggerel
            as fossil remnants of it, or perhaps as conscious imitations, e.g., Collier (1831, 3:62–3): The
              circumstance, that he borrowed certain parts from the old History of
                Error, will explain all that the commentators have said regarding doggerel
                [63] verses, and the apparent authorship of two different
              persons in the same play. The doggerel fourteen-syllabic verses given to the two
              Dromios are precisely such as were used in dramatic performances not long before the
              period when Shakespeare began to write for the stage.

          White (ed. 1857,
            3:137): He deliberately imitated, populo ut
                placere[n]t, the versification of the old play, alluding to
            Terence’s famous formulation in the prologue to Andria, that the
            author thought his only business was to see that his plays pleased the
              people.

          Those who conclude that Sh. could never write such verse include Oliphant (1909, p. 349), Wilson (ed. 1922,
            p. 77), Robertson (1923, p. 127)—That any one should ever have seen a
              Shakespearean touch in any of it is a monition to us of the difficulty which faces
              every attempt to modify the temper of traditionism (he thinks Marlowe wrote
            the blank verse sections of Err.)—and Gaw (Evolution, 1926), who tries to prove that Err. was
            written by two earlier writers, A and B (Kyd) before Sh.
            brought it to its present shape. The hypothesis of a Shn. revision allows a later dating
            than would be possible if the whole play were Sh.’s apprentice work.

          The fitful desire to see Err. (and most of the earliest plays)
            as Sh.’s rewriting of earlier plays ends in the late 1920s, coincident with Baldwin’s (ed.
            1928, pp. 106–7) devastating critique of Wilson and Gaw: It is pointed out [uncited, but Gaw, Evolution, 1926, p. 632] that the heart of [3.1] consists
                of doggerel couplets . . . which are identical in form with the typical metre of
                the mid-sixteenth century academic comedy, of which Ralph
                  Roister-Doister and Gammer Gurton’s Needle are
                the sole surviving specimens [Wilson, ed. 1922, p. 77]. I am at a loss to
              find any way in which these two plays may be said to be the sole survivors of the
              type. He refers to the plays quoted by Malone (ed. 1790, 2:203–4). In [107] more recent times, Mr. R. W. Bond [Early
                Plays from the Italian, 1911, pp. lxxxiii ff.] has examined this doggerel
              verse to show that it was the prevalent early comic form, and was being displaced only
              in the decade between 1580–1590 by prose under the example of John Lyly. . . . It is
              thus clear that Malone’s is the natural inference: that since this doggerel form is a
              survival from the earlier period, Shakespeare’s plays in which it occurs presumably
              belong to his early work. . . . The considerable bulk of doggerel in Shakespeare’s
              early plays makes it hard to avoid the conclusion that Shakespeare must himself have
              written some of this type. But if he wrote some, then there is as yet no evidence nor
              inference to deprive him of any.

          Chambers (1930,
            1:308): It seems to me just as easy to suppose that here and in The Taming of the Shrew and Love’s Labour’s Lost,
              where there is also a substantial use of doggerel, Shakespeare was consciously
              experimenting with an archaistic form for comic effect.

          Knight (ed.
            1842, pp. 126–7) also judges that the doggerel marks Err. as an
            early play. Heraud (1865, pp. 38–9), commenting on the doggerel as a sign that
              Err. is early, dates it 1586, following TGV (1585).

        





        
          Vocabulary

          A number of words in Err. appear in other early plays, then
            fall out of use. Sarrazin (1897, p. 103) points to disanull
              (147) only in 3H6; demeane (1265) only in 2H6; demean’d
              (1557) only in 2, 3
              H6; goods confiscate (24, 164) in
              3H6 and the later MV. See nn. on
              these lines. He also points out several verbal similarities with the same plays
            such as And when the sunne shines, let foolish gnats make sport (425) and And whether flye the Gnats but
              to the sunne? (3H6, 2.6.9
              [1289]) that have less weight. See also n. 1082–3.

          Waller (1966,
            pp. 4–5) tabulates the increased use of informal structures (does,
              has for doth, hath,
            contractions such as i’th’ and ’em) as Sh.
            develops a freer, more supple verse. He arrays his findings in Chambers’s order (see ).

          Brainerd (1980)
            selects 20 words with their various word forms (e.g., could, couldst, couldest) to discover their
            frequency in plays of well-attested date of composition compared to their frequency in
            plays of disputed date. Each play produces a value—a number—that he adds to or subtracts
            from 1600, the supposed, and likely, midpoint of Sh.’s composing career. His database is
            Marvin Spevack’s A Complete and Systematic Concordance (1968),
            based on the text of Evans (ed. 1974). He also uses Evans’s chronology to compare the dates
            his computation produces—the date for Err. is 1594. Wells &amp; Taylor (1987, p. 101) add a new
              colloquialism-in-verse test for the entire canon that substantially
            corroborates all the other evidence they present. Theirs is the most thorough recent
            review of the chronology; see  above for their
            conclusion.

          Hope (1994, p.
            40), using the frequency of which to mark a relative clause and
            of such clauses without the which marker, observes there is one strikingly anomalous result: which usage in
                The Comedy of Errors is much lower than in any other play
              of this date. This result calls for explanation, but it is not easy to know what to
              say about it. . . . 

          There may be a case for seeing this as an example of a young playwright
              experimenting with the texture of his language. However, I find this an unsatisfactory
              explanation of the result—in no other early play do we find such experimentation. Nor
              do I think that this result can be explained by any special circumstance in the genre
              or plot of The Comedy of Errors. He counts (p. 159)
            only 7 whichs against an average of about 25 in his control group
            of early plays that are the sole work of Sh.: TGV, LLL, R2, MND, and
              MV, and he counts 23 so-called zero clauses (those lacking
              who, which, or that) in Err. compared with an average of about 12 in
            those plays. He dates Err. between TGV
            and LLL without explaining why he adopts this chronology; if he
            had placed Err. first, the averages he graphs for TGV and LLL become similar without the
            large anomaly of Err. dividing them, and he might have been
            willing to accept the suggestions about experimentation and genre that he rejects. He
            does not quote or give the line numbers of any of his examples, nor does he remark on
            how short Err. is. (Vickers [1995, p. 5] suggests in a review of Hope’s book that
            the anomalies may be due to Shakespeare having boldly conflated two comedies by
              Plautus . . . ; working from Latin may do something to one’s English.)

          
          Foster (1997,
            pp. 128 ff.) uses a computer database, Shaxicon, that focuses on
              Shakespeare’s rare vocabulary—words used in the canonical plays twelve
              times or less—and maps it by date, text, and speaking character. The results provide a
              new window on Shakespeare’s dual career as a writer and a man of the theater,
              revealing that his choice of words was shaped by his reading and by the plays in
              production when he wrote. . . . 

          [133] Shakespeare’s writing after 1594 registers
              a strongly disproportionate recall of the Egeon role . . . relative to other
              characters in the play. . . . 

          The structural match between the recollected language of W. S. and
              Shakespeare can be traced back to the earliest years of Shakespeare’s career. For
              instance, the Egeon role, which Shakespeare appears to have studied as early as 1594
              and again in 1604–05 and 1612–13, supplies 11.9 percent of the rare words in The Comedy of Errors. Of The Comedy’s
              rare words that appear also in Henry VIII, 22.0 percent are
              supplied by the Egeon role. In other words, Shaxicon locates roughly twice as many
              Egeon words in this cross sample as would be produced by a proportionate distribution
              by character. Henry VIII is thus influenced by Shakespeare’s
              having learned the Egeon role. The role likewise influences other late texts. Of the
              rare words that appear both in The Comedy and in
              Shakespeare’s portion of The Two Noble Kinsmen, 39.0 percent
              are supplied by Egeon, more than triple Egeon’s share of the lexical pool. . . . In
              comparison, Egeon supplies just 11.4 percent of the rare words that appear in the
              cross sample of The Comedy and Jonson’s Every Man in His Humor and [134] only 9.1 percent of
              the rare words that appear in the cross sample of The Comedy
              and Fletcher’s presumed portions of The Two Noble Kinsmen and
                Henry VIII. Clearly, neither Jonson nor Fletcher studied or
              memorized the Egeon role as Shakespeare did, i.e., neither of them wrote this
            role. (For criticism of Foster’s statistical methods, see Vickers [2002], esp. pp.
            192–3.)
          

          Others who use statistical vocabulary tests to place Err. in
            the order of the plays are Hart (1943), between R3 and Ven and Tit. and Slater (1975), between R3 and Tit.

        





        
          Metrical Tests

          Fleay (1876)
            divides the plays into periods using metrical and rhyming tests; the frequency of
            doggerel, alternate rhymes, and rhymed couplets decreases from the first to the last
            plays, while alexandrines, weak endings, double endings, short lines, and the like
            increase (pp. 70–1). In a metrical table (p. 135) he counts 380 five-foot rhymes and
            1,150 blank verse lines, which place Err. third in the
              Plays of the first (rhyming) period, after LLL
            and MND, and before Rom. and R2, though on p. 25 he places it second, between LLL and MND.

          Dowden (1877;
            1882, pp. 41, 43): Light and weak endings increase with time. To the former class
              belong are, am, be, can, could; the auxiliaries
                do, does, has,
                had; I, they,
                thou, and others. . . . The latter—the weak endings—are more
              fugitive and evanescent in character, including such words as and, for, from, if, in, of, or. Now weak endings hardly appear in Shakspere’s early or middle
              plays. The Errors and The Two Gentlemen of
                Verona do not contain a single light or weak ending.

          Double endings (11-syllable lines ending in an unstressed syllable) also increase with
            time. (P. 43): If double endings are rare, we may infer that the play is of early
              date; if they are numerous, that the play is one of Shakspere’s middle or later
              period.

          Pulling (1879,
            p. 458) tabulates the number of speeches ending in midline; Err. has only 6, well behind the later TGV with
            24.

          Fleay (1881, p.
            101) gives metrical tables involving such categories as the number of blank verse,
            rhymed verse, prose lines, double (female) endings, and the like. His
            counting is very suspect, though the general outline is usually correct. His total lines
            equal 1,777 compared to the TLN of 1909.

          König (1888,
            pp. 131–8) tabulates the percentage of rhyme, feminine endings, enjambments, and
            speeches ending within lines to group Err. with different sets
            of plays; he concludes that it follows 1–3 H6 and Tit. as Sh.’s fifth play.

          Heuser (1894,
            p. 244), on the basis of the percentage of rhymed couplets in Err., places it fourth in the order of composition, after LLL and R2 and before Rom.
            and Mac. But he ranks MND first and
              Ado next to last.

          Creizenach
            (1916, p. 319), using König’s tables: Shakespeare in his early plays is richer in
              rhymes than any of his fellows.

          Gaw (Evolution, 1926, p. 637) gives a table that shows the distribution
            in each scene of the Tetrameter Couplets (he calls the doggerel
              rough anapestic tetrameters), blank verse lines, pentameter rhymed
            couplets and cross-rhymed lines (abab), and prose lines, as well
            as percentages of double-ending (feminine) blank verse lines, of lines ending in voiced
              -ed, of lines ending -ion, -ious, -ience, and of balanced
              lines (adjective-noun-connective-adjective-noun). His is the most complete
            presentation of these features, which he uses to refine Wilson’s (ed. 1922) argument of Sh.’s
            revision of an earlier play. They both think the doggerel especially non-Shn.

          For Baldwin’s (ed. 1928, pp. 101–13) refutation of the conclusions of Gaw and Wilson see  above. On p. 110 he has a table that breaks down
            all metrical phenomena by scene.

          Chambers (1930,
            1:254–74) surveys and adjudicates the worth of stylistic tests of vocabulary and,
            especially, meter that took up so much energy in the preceding 80 years. He produces his
            own table showing the proportion of strong midline pauses to the total lines on 2:402,
            where he places Err. fourth after 2, 3
              H6 and R3, though he leaves for a special table
              1H6 and Tit., plays that perhaps
            preceded Err.

          Gray (1931, p.
            148), averaging together the percentages of double endings, run-on lines, and speeches
            ending within the line to get a truer sequence of the plays than any single test
              would yield, places Err. sixth, between the earlier
              Shr. and R3.

          Reinhold (1942,
            p. 87), calculating the percentage of verse lines split between two or more speakers,
            places Err. fifth, after the H6 plays
            and Tit. and before R3 and Shr.

          Wentersdorf
            (1951, p. 187), calculating a metrical index that averages as a
            percentage the percentages of extrasyllabic pentameter, run-ons, and pauses in unsplit
            lines and split lines, scores Err. 12, placing it third, after
              Tit. and 1H6 and before 2, 3 H6. He is strongly influenced by the Henri IV allusions—Henri
            was heir between 1584 and 1589, king in 1589—and by his sense of the
              crudeness of the piece (above, ). He grants that his indices are unreliable for the nonhistorical plays written
            before Rom., due to the fact that the poetry of the
              historical period is more formal (p. 186) than the freer language of the early
            comedies.

        


      





      
        Shakespeare’s Development

        Critics who see a development in Sh.’s growth as a dramatist play-by-play, looking now at
          one aspect, now at another, usually grant that it is impossible to know the precise order
          of composition of the early comedies, but then construct one that supports their theories.
          Few attempt to give dates.

        Dowden (1875, pp.
          56–7) lists 2, 3 H6, TGV, LLL, and Err. as five experiments: The
            Comedy of Errors [is] a comedy of incident, of almost farcical adventure—the sole
            attempt of Shakspere at imitation of the comic drama of ancient Rome. In this [57] play Shakspere gaily confronts improbabilities, and requires
            the spectator to accept them. . . . Let the incredible become a twofold incredibility,
            and it is none the worse. We may conclude that, while Shakspere was ready to try his
            hand upon a farcical subject, a single experiment satisfied him that this was not his
            province; for to such subjects he never returned.

        Idem (1877; 1882,
          pp. 37–9) lists impressionistic criteria for internal dating: (a)
          style and diction: In the earliest plays the language is sometimes as it were a
            dress put upon the thought—a dress ornamented with superfluous care. . . . Under this
            head of style may be noticed Shakspere’s early conceits, puns, frequent classical
            allusions, occasional over-wrought rhetoric (especially in the historical plays), all of
            which gradually disappear or subside. . . . (b) The growth of
            Shakspere’s taste and judgment. . . . [38] (c) In the structure of the play and grouping of characters there is, in some of
            the early plays, a tendency to formal symmetry, an artificial setting of character over
            against character, and group against group: Antipholus and Dromio against Antipholus and
            Dromio. . . . Afterwards the outline of the play is drawn with a freer because a firmer
            hand. (d) The characterisation changes. At first there are bright
            and clever sketches of character; . . . sometimes character is subordinate to incident
            (as in the Errors . . . ). By degrees the characterisation
            becomes profound and refined. . . . (e) The entire reflective
            power deepens. . . . (f) The imagination, which at first worked
            intermittently, leaving . . . spaces for the fancy to practise its slight devices in,
            becomes passionately energetic, of daring and all-comprehensive power. . . . (g) The sympathy with human passion and power of conceiving and
            dramatically rendering it in its most massive and most intense [39] forms increases. (h) . . . The humour of the
            dramatist, which was at first comparatively superficial—an enjoyment of amusing
            absurdity, with pleasure in the keen play of wit—becomes full of grave significance, and
            works in conjunction with his (i) Deepening pathos. . . . (j) Finally, in moral reach, in true justice, in charity, in
            self-control, in all that indicates fortitude of will, the writings of the mature
            Shakspere excel, in an extraordinary degree, those of his younger self.

        Dowden knows that
          these matters cannot be weighed and measured but believes that the changes
          in Sh.’s verse admit of exact scientific estimations.

        
          (1) . . . At first Shakspere has his breaks and pauses at the end of the line—the
            verse is end-stopt; gradually he more and more found pleasure in carrying
            on the sense from one line to another without a pause at the end of the line—the verse
            is run on, and the breaks and pauses occur with great frequency in some
            part of the line other than the end.
        

        Latham (1892, pp.
          399–401): In The Comedy of Errors the style is
            changed [from metaphors used to decorate rather than to define and illustrate thought as
            in LLL], approaching more nearly to that of Shakspere’s later
            works than in any other of the first four comedies, especially the blank verse passages.
            In the opening the Duke uses metaphors to express his meaning with greater force [400] than plain, straightforward speech could do; they give
            judicial weight. [Quotes 7–14.]

        
          Ægeon’s long story is clearly and simply told, with a few metaphors to
            give it strength and vividness. Nearly all are personifications: We were
              encountered by a mighty rock [104], is a good example of Shakspere’s later use of them, in which, by
            lending individual life to inanimate objects, or abstract qualities, he gives a force to
            thought or situation not otherwise obtainable. . . . 
        

        [401] But when we come to the love scene between
            Antipholus of Syracuse and Luciana, Act III. sc. ii., we get an artificial style, an
            evident strain after fine writing. Her speech following, Muffle your false love
              with some show of blindness [794],
            is a repetition of that line in a series of metaphors; as though Shakspere felt that
            lover’s talk required beautiful poetry, but could not yet adapt it to express all the
            throes, concealments, and confessions of the human heart.

        For Isaac (1884,
          p. 234), studying parallels in thought and expression in the youthful sonnet
            period, see  above.

        Baker (1907, pp.
          139–40), arguing that Err. comes after LLL and TGV in 1594: Let any one who
            doubts the greater sureness of Shakespeare here in characterization contrast his
            treatment of Sir Eglamour or Thurio . . . with his development of Angelo in the first
            scene of Act IV of this play. Again his great gain in control of his material appears in
            his sure-footed movement as he threads his way through the confusion worse confounded of
            the last scene of Act IV and in his development of the last act. All that he was unable
            to do in closing The Two Gentlemen of Verona he is competent
            for in this play. . . . 

        [140] Indeed, so wise and so firm is the handling
            of the material in this adaptation [of Plautus] that one would almost be inclined to say
            a large part of its merit must date from the performance at Court in 1604, when
            Shakespeare had acquired his technique, were it not that the plays we are to consider
            next, Romeo and Juliet and The Merchant of
              Venice, give proof that shortly before their composition such work as this
            must have been possible for Shakespeare.

        Baldwin (1927,
          tables inserted between pp. 228 and 229) presents a chronology of the plays that, despite
          many repetitions and great elaboration, has not enlisted support. This chronology depends
          in part on his concept of how Sh. learned to manage the plotting of plays, discussed in
          the section on structure, . Baldwin’s
          chronology is as follows: LLL in its first version, winter 1588;
            Love’s Labor’s Won, an early version of AWW, summer 1589; Err., winter 1589; TGV, summer 1590. The chronicles and early tragedies were, he says, written
          after these four.

        For several reasons—topical references and echoes of other works—Baldwin anchors Err. before Christmas 1589, but he finds corroboration in the sequence he
          proposes. At the end of a very long book, Idem (1947, p. 785) says that his true aim is to get the
          sequence of Sh.’s plays in order, not their absolute dates. But in fact he must make
            LLL depend on an amalgamation of Endimion and Gallathea, plays he thinks Sh. saw in
          London in the season of 1587–8, because LLL is his first play and
          so must predate Err., solidly fixed in 1589. That the two Lyly
          plays were printed in 1591 and 1592 makes it imperative that Sh. saw the plays earlier so
          that he could construct LLL. (P. 623): The whole structure
            and character types and groupings . . . derived from Endimion
            and Shakspere’s company, with some structural assistance from Gallathea.

        Rylands (1928,
          pp. 140–1, 182): on Sh.’s early verse style, especially the anaphora (508–13), which is the
            versification of poetry which is to be read, not spoken. It is the versification of
            Spenser, of Venus and Adonis and Lucrece, and it was some time before Shakespeare grew out of it. For one
            thing, it jingles prettily, for another, it helps to increase the speed. The actor can
            take the lines at a run. . . . [141] This might best be called
              stanza movement . . . . [182] Young
            poets, especially when they are writing to order and against time, use adjectives to
            fill up gaps. Shakespeare is no exception. In the Comedy of
              Errors we frequently meet with the familiar combination of two epithets and
            two nouns [quoting 54–7].

        Langworthy (1931,
          p. 748), studying the diminishing correspondence of grammatical sense units (independent
          clauses, nonrestrictive clauses, etc.) with verse lines as Sh.’s career unfolded, places
            Err. fifth, after 1H6, TGV, Shr, and 3H6,
          before R3 and 2H6. He uses the Oxford
          (1925–7) text, which diminishes the value of his work because the ed. makes decisions
          about ambiguous syntax.

        Elton (1936, p.
          81), impressionistically surveying Sh.’s style, says of 1788–99: [Egeon’s] outcry
            might be too piercing for so light a play if we did not know that presently all will be
            well. The style—of the kind that comes to sustained perfection in the Dream—is of the purest; and the verse, though still, and for long afterwards,
            moving within the bounds of the self-enclosed line, still runs over freely, the whole
            period being spoken almost in a breath.

        Charlton (1931;
          1938, pp. 44 ff.) argues for the sequence LLL, Err., TGV, Shr. as he
          observes Sh. trying to harmonize the elements of romance and comedy, the one requiring
          men, especially, to behave in conventionally loverly ways that the theater finds absurd;
          romance tends toward sprawling plots, comedy requires considerable shaping. Hence he
          speaks of Sh.’s recoil from the (p. 47) formlessness and the
            spinelessness of the thing [LLL] as a play to a
            discipline which, however uncongenial to the spirit, was a salutary apprenticeship to
            the mechanics of play-building.

        Clemen (1951, p.
          219): This [early] style possessed its own merits and found expression, not only in
            diction and imagery, but in all other elements of dramatic art as well. Thus the
            artificial and formal quality of the imagery has its equivalent in the artificial and
            symmetrical grouping of the characters (e.g. in the Comedy of
              Errors). And the imagery’s tendency to typify and conventionalize rather than
            to individualize, to express commonplace truisms instead of unique experiences also
            corresponds to the whole manner and atmosphere of these early plays.

        Halliday (1954,
          pp. 71–2): The earliest example of [the] extension of the harmony from the line to
            the passage as a whole is in The Comedy of Errors, III.ii,
            where Antipholus of Syracuse makes love to the bewildered Luciana. His speech is in
            alternate rhyme, and the assonance is emphasized by fixing it on trochaic words that
            immediately precede or succeed the middle of the line: Than our
              earth’s wonder; more than earth divine . . . [819] To make it wander in an unknown field. [825] [72] It is all very
            self-conscious and unashamedly undramatic—Shakespeare has forgotten the play in the
            excitement of the poetry—but it is a development of profound significance. As so
          often, development depends on the chronology used by the critic.

        Bullough (1957,
          1: 203): Since it [TGV] replaces the dry hardness of
              A Comedy of Errors [sic] and The
              Shrew with some of the warmth and eloquence, the surplusage of word-play,
            found in A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Love’s
              Labour’s Lost, the play probably belongs to the same group, though it may be
            earlier than these, for it treats its romantic theme with a somewhat jejune absence of
            self-criticism hardly possible after their delighted mockery of love.

        Traversi (1960,
          pp. 9–10, 13): Since the working out of a complex pattern to its formal
            conclusion is an essential part of Shakespeare’s mature comic conception, we should not
            underestimate the importance of this exercise in plot-making to his developing
            art.

        
          Scarcely less important is the skilful use of different forms of verse,
            and where necessary of a contrasted prose, to point the contrasts which operate within
            the carefully contrived unity of the plot. The prose given to the servants, generally to
            convey a comic comment upon the way in which their [10] masters
            are behaving, stands out effectively against the stiffness of much of the surrounding
            verse. It can rise on occasion to a notable vivacity, as when Dromio of Syracuse
            describes for his master’s benefit the sargent of the band, the police
            officer coming to make his arrest: [quotes 1206–11]. The comparisons are indeed far-fetched in their
            variety, pressed too deliberately into use; but the vigour of the sequence, the firm
            grounding in situations seen and familiar, is of a kind that Shakespeare will develop to
            superb effect in his later work. Taken together with the lively use of the hitherto
            crude long verse line in a close chain of rhyming repartee (such as we find . . . in
            Act III scene i) and the solid construction of the blank verse whenever the play’s more
            serious moments require it, we must be struck with a facility, a fluent command of
            familiar modes of expression, that causes the play to stand out from its classical and
            contemporary models.
        

        The Abbess’s holy prayers and determination to care for Antipholus because of the (p. 13)
            charitable duty of my order (1576) anticipate the symbolic and spiritual order which
            haunts Shakespeare’s last plays.

        Draper (1961, p.
          28) sketches Sh.’s management of antecedent action, i.e., what the audience
          needs to know about what happened before the action begins. He complains of the
            arid stretch of merely rhetorical monologue of Egeon’s opening speech in
          this second of his plays, LLL being first. Shakespeare had
            not yet mastered the management of antecedent action, and this effort comes off somewhat
            tardy.

        
        Wells (1963, pp.
          163 ff.) studies character manipulation, finding that the ending of TGV is much more primitive dramaturgically than those of Err. or Shr. In TGV Sh. is
            limited almost exclusively to three devices: soliloquy, duologue, and the aside
            as comment, and when Sh. steps outside these limits he strands a third or fourth
          person who must look on, unaccounted for, as a pair speak, as notoriously in the final
          scene where (p. 165) Sylvia says nothing at all while she is first donated
            by Valentine to Proteus, then rejected by him in favour of Julia, then claimed by
            Thurio, only in his next breath to be renounced by him, and finally handed back to
            Valentine by her father. . . . 

        
           . . . I find it difficult to [166] imagine how a
            dramatist with a technique of character-manipulation as limited as this play reveals,
            not only in scenes, such as the last, where he had to wrestle with thematic
            complexities, but also in straightforward scenes of exposition, could, unaided, have
            plotted, for instance, the last scenes of The Comedy of Errors
            and The Taming of the Shrew and much of Richard III: plays often thought of as earlier than The Two
              Gentlemen of Verona.
        
        

        On Bullough above
          (p. 166): It seems to me equally possible that a young writer should begin with
              warmth and eloquence and only then, discovering in himself technical
            deficiencies, restrain these qualities at the risk of dry hardness in
            order to acquire greater formal discipline.

        His argument helps to persuade Dorsch (ed. 1988, p. 6) that Err. was written
          between Apr. 1591 and June 1592, after TGV and Shr.

        Phialas (1966, p.
          24), wishing to read the plays as nearly as possible in the order of their composition,
          objects to Charlton’s recoil: Shakespeare need not have been
            such an incorrigible recoiler. Instead, he may well have proceeded by writing the two
            early farces which, besides their own close relationship, are heavily indebted to
            Plautine theme and tone; and it is equally likely that The Two
              Gentlemen of Verona initiates in earnest the entrance of romance into
            Shakespearean comedy, henceforth to become its chief theme for which the dramatist is to
            fashion his own special structure.

        Earlier, in his introductory chapter on Err., Phialas notes the
          additions of the shipwreck story and of Luciana as a romantic interest (p. 4):
            Shakespeare gave the whole a slightly new coloring by complicating its structure
            and by adding two new themes to the extravagant realism of the Menaechmi. One of these is the framing story of Egeon and Emilia, the
            accidentally separated parents of the lost twin brothers, which makes possible the
            general family reunion at the conclusion of the play. . . . The other
            addition . . . is the creation of Luciana and the episode of her wooing by Antipholus
            of Syracuse in [787–860]. In view of Shakespeare’s later comedies this is a far more
            significant addition since love and wooing became the chief concern of those plays. In
            introducing these two themes Shakespeare attempted for the first time what he was to do
            far more adroitly later in play after play, that is, to present in meaningful comic
            relationship elements of romance and realism.

        He recognizes that the date of composition is not certain, but says that he is more
          interested in the sequence in which the early plays were written than in absolute
          dates.

        (P. 6) The Comedy of Errors shares with The Taming of the Shrew a boisterous farcical action as well as the theme of
            the shrewish wife, a theme the latter play treats far more extensively. Furthermore,
            while The Comedy of Errors deals with love and wooing in a
            single episode, The Taming of the Shrew devotes its entire
            action to the wooing of the two sisters . . . although of course the wooing of the
            latter is of a special kind. In the third play, The Two Gentlemen of
              Verona, Shakespeare gives further prominence not only to wooing but also to
            romantic love which henceforth becomes the chief subject of his romantic comedy. This
            relative emphasis on wooing and romantic love in the three plays indicates strongly that
              The Comedy of Errors was almost certainly Shakespeare’s
            earliest comedy.

        Champion (1970,
          pp. 5 ff.) traces the development of Sh.’s characters in terms of increasing credible growth through their interaction upon one another. . . . 

        [9] Shakespeare, then, whose development as a
            comic playwright is consistently in the direction of complexity or depth of
            characterization, deals with each of these levels of characterization. His earliest
            works, like those of his contemporaries, are essentially situation comedies: the humor
            arises from action rather than character. There is no significant development of the
            main characters; instead, they are manipulated into situations which are humorous as a
            result . . . of mistaken identity or slapstick confusion. Thus, the characters are
            revealed only in terms of what they do, outer action. The Antipholuses and
            Dromios . . . are cases in point, manipulated as they are amidst a confused wife,
            courtesan, kitchen wench, sea captain [sic], and goldsmith.

        For Turner
          (1974), who dates the play as Sh.’s first, in 1588–90, see  above. His whole book, on how Sh. used his early training in
          rhetoric to compose his first plays, is valuable and does not really need the priority of
            Err. for most of its analyses.

        Mincoff (1976,
          pp. 156 ff.), elaborating articles in 1964 and 1973, states that Err.
          marks such an advance in style and poetic power on The Taming of
              the Shrew that Err. must be considerably
          later. Similes are fewer, tending in fact to disappear; he counts seven similes to 112
          metaphors. Those metaphors (p. 157) have increased greatly, not only in quantity
            but in power too, and the whole poetic texture has become infinitely richer, he
          says, singling out Adriana’s reproaches in 2.1 and 2.2, the wooing of Luciana in 3.2,
          Egeon’s laments in 5.1, and Balthazar’s advice to E. Antipholus in 3.1. He dates Err. autumn 1591 (see Comparative Chronologies below).

        Honigmann (1982,
          1985) dates 11 plays before 1592, much earlier than the orthodox, though not universally
          accepted, 1590–4. Thomas (1988, p. 188) objects that to date many plays before Greene’s
            upstart Crow attack of 1592, with its clear implication that its
            object is a Johnny-come-lately trying to imitate his betters, in reference to an
            established playwright with eleven plays to his credit, including the enormously popular
              Romeo and Juliet, defies belief.

        Ornstein (1986,
          p. 25): Since these plays [Err., LLL, TGV in his order] are very different from one
            another in form and substance and seem to be discrete artistic experiments by a
            playwright still seeking his own metier in comedy, I see no point in arguing about their
            chronology. I begin with Errors, not because it is more
            primitive artistically than the others, but because it seems to me probable that
            Shakespeare began his career in comedy by imitating and adapting Plautus, and struck out
            on his own in Love’s Labor’s and Two
              Gentlemen after exploring the possibilities and recognizing the limitations of
            Roman farce. The fluent verse of Errors suggests that like the
            other early comedies it was written after Shakespeare had already served his
            apprenticeship as a dramatic poet in the Henry VI plays. . . . At its best the poetry
            of Errors has a colloquial ease and raciness that is not
            achieved in the history plays until the Bastard enters in King
              John.

        Cole (1993, p.
          241) thinks Sh. had read Laurence Twine’s The Patterne of Painefull
            Aduentures (revised STC 709.5, dated 1594; entered in
          S.R. 7 Jul. 1576), a version of Apollonius of Tyre, and Mother Bombie (entered in S.R. 18 June 1594) and was then asked in the
          summer or fall to produce something for the Gray’s Inn revels. He prefers the order TGV, LLL, Err. Those
          revels were not settled on until Dec. 1594; see .

        Wells (1994, p.
          57): Although much of it is written in verse of considerable virtuosity The Comedy of Errors is one of Shakespeare’s least obviously
            poetical plays. In it his verbal powers are fully at the service of his overall dramatic
            aims. Often the situations require no more than swift, economical writing, carrying us
            along briskly from one comic point to the next. But Shakespeare, already a master of
            dramatic rhythm, knew that the pace would become wearisome if it remained unvaried. From
            time to time he relaxes the pace of the ongoing action to allow the inclusion of
            passages of comic writing in which the situation is not advanced but enlarged upon. Such
            is Dromio of Syracuse’s brilliant description of the kitchen wench who, mistaking him
            for his twin, presses her attentions upon him: [quotes 886–91]. . . . [Dromio’s] comic
            catechism . . . preserves the comic tone while giving us a rest from following the
            complications of the action. Equally brilliant in a different way is Antipholus of
            Ephesus’s description of Dr Pinch and his efforts to cure him of his supposed madness:
            [quotes 1712–17].

        In its matching of style to content, its dramatic economy, its tautness of
            construction, and its bold interfusion of farce with romance, The
              Comedy of Errors has claims to be considered as Shakespeare’s first real
            masterpiece.
          Wells places
            Err. in time after TGV and Shr.

        On the basis of the abab rhymes as influenced by Ven. and Luc., on the skillful casting for a smaller
          company following the establishment of the Lord Chamberlain’s men, and on the advance in
          character manipulation argued for by Baker and Wells, I believe that Sh. wrote the play after he joined the
          Chamberlain’s men in mid-1594, but well before December. If he did use Twine’s Patterne of Painefull Aduentures (1594), as Cole and others argue, that would
          settle the matter. The likely echoes of Marlowe, noted by Foakes and Brooks above, however, make 1592 a
          possibility, in the last few months before the closing of the theaters in May 1592.
          Likewise, the arguments for earlier dating by Baldwin, Phialas, Evans, Turner, and others have weight.

          of a play involve what plays stand in its vicinity, I give here several influential

      Sources and Influences

      The commonly agreed on sources are Plautus’s Menaechmi and Amphitruo; the Bible, Acts 19 and the Epistle
        to the Ephesians (not certainly one of Saint Paul’s compositions); the liturgy; and John
        Gower’s Apollonius of Tyre (in Book 8 of the Confessio Amantis). Although Bullough (1957, vol. 1) does not include the biblical or
        liturgical passages, the rest are reprinted or excerpted by him: Menaechmi in the 1595 version of William Warner; Amphitruo in the translation of Edward Sugden, which lacks a passage known to Sh.
        included below; and Apollonius in G. C. Macauley’s ed., different
        from the lines included below. Warner is reprinted quite often, e.g., Hazlitt (1874–6), Cuningham (ed. 1907),
        and Bevington (ed.
        1988). Foakes (ed.
        1962) summarizes the plots of Menaechmi and Amphitruo; he also prints extracts of Acts and Ephesians.





      
        Titus Maccius Plautus

        While, so far as I know, everyone now agrees that Sh. read Latin well enough to study
          both Menaechmi and Amphitruo, there was
          a brisk debate about his ability that ran from the beginning of the 18th c. into the
          middle of the 20th c. Both the date of composition and Sh.’s reliance on Plautus are
          affected by how one decides the matter. The following summarizes the debate. Any
          uncertainty about Sh.’s Latinity was settled massively by Baldwin (1944), who also presents the
          18th-c. positions with substantial abstracts (1:53–74).

        Was Sh. a schoolmaster? Chambers (1930, 2:254) quotes John Aubrey, Brief
            Lives ca. 1681: Though as Ben: Johnson sayes of him, that he had but
            little Latine and lesse Greek, He understood Latine pretty well: for he had been in his
            younger yeares a Schoolmaster in the Countrey. &lt;In margin,
              from Mr —— Beeston.&gt; Beeston is
          William, son of Christopher, a Chamberlain’s man with Sh. Adams (1923, pp. 94–5) champions this
          notion of Sh.’s occupation during the so-called Lost Years, between his marriage and the
          christenings of his three children in 1582–5, and 1592, when he is probably the object of
          Robert Greene’s attack as the only Shake-scene in a country in his Groats-worth of witte. Langbaine (1691, p. 455): This Play is founded
            on Plautus his Mænechmi: and if it
              [Err.] be not a just Translation, ’tis at least a Paraphrase:
            and I think far beyond the Translation, call’d Menechmus, which
            was printed 4o. Lond. 1595. Langbaine seems to say that
          Sh. had enough Latin to make any use of Warner unnecessary, but his language is not as
          clear as one would like. Gildon (1699, pp. 126–7): I am of Opinion, in spight of Mr. Johnson [i.e., Ben Jonson], . . . that though perhaps he might not
            be that Critic in Latin and Greek as Ben; yet that he understood
            the former, so well as perfectly to be Master of their Histories. . . . [127] The Comedy of Errors, a Comedy, fol. The Ground from Plautus, Amphitruo, and Mænechmi. He repeats
          and expands his opinion in 1710, p. 300. Knight (ed. 1842, p. 129): The commentators have
            puzzled themselves, after their usual fashion, with the evidence which this play
            undoubtedly presents of Shakspere’s ability to read Latin, and their dogged resolution
            to maintain the opinion that in an age of grammar-schools our poet never could have
            attained that common accomplishment.
          Halliwell (ed. 1854,
          p. 445): [R.] Bentley, one of the publishers of the Comedy Mistaken Husband, 4to
            Lond. 1675 . . . thus alludes to the Comedy of Errors in his address to the
              reader:—the resemblance of one man to another has not only been the foundation
              of this, but of many other plays. Plautus his Amphitrion was the original of all, and
              Shakespear and Moliere have copied him with success.

        Those who do not think Sh. knew sufficient Latin include the following. Capell (1774, p. 70)
          speaks of the model he had to work upon, namely Warner, inventing an
          acquaintanceship between the two Warwickshire men, from whom Sh. probably gained his
          admirable knowledge of the classical unities. Steevens (ed. 1773, 2:165) and Malone (ed. 1790, 1:289) likewise assume
          Sh. used Warner’s translation, perhaps because it circulated in manuscript before
          publication, as the title page says it did. Farmer (1789, pp. 63–4), the most skeptical and
          persistent of the anti-Latinists: That the Comedy of
              Errors is founded on the Menæchmi, it is notorious:
            nor is it less so, that a Translation of it by W. W. perhaps William
              Warner . . . was extant in the time of Shakespeare; tho’
            Mr. Upton, [64] and some other advocates
            for his [Sh.’s] learning, have cautiously dropt the mention of it.
          Mills (1885, p.
          189) in a lecture for the Bristol Shakspere Society, 24 Jan. 1885, denies that Sh. had
          read Plautus or Warner: Ben Jonson had read the Menæchini
            [sic; always so spelled in this report], and from him Shakespeare doubtless learned the
            incidents of the play.






        
          
            Menaechmi
          

          Warner’s translation of Menaechmi was printed in 1595. Many
            early critics argue that Sh. used it as a source. Judgments about Sh.’s possible
            indebtedness will be found above, in Date of Composition. The translation is printed
            here as being the only contemporary translation and in lieu of the Latin that Sh.
            presumably knew but that most modern readers are unable to read. In the Commentary I
            have quoted Gill’s (1930) parallels to the Latin play as an aid to those who wish to
            consult it (numbers to TLNs): 5–34, 35–142, 53–61, 110–14, 127–42, 131,
              171–8, 182–4, 197–204, 205–60, 208–32, 208–17, 218–60, 261–71, 275–7, 278–317, 363–92, 402–3, 421–3, 505–41, 542–3, 547–8, 562–4, 575–615, 602–4, 619–51, 624–8, 651–745, 768–82, 787–814, 873–9, 946–79, 959, 982–1072, 1101–2, 1184–94, 1196–1226, 1228–63, 1323–63, 1392,
              1396–7, 1398–1424, 1448–61, 1505–36, 1537–81, 1813–26, 1816–1918, 1827–47.

          Warner’s translation follows the Latin quite closely in lively, idiomatic prose. He
            does not translate about 75 lines, spread out over the 1,162 lines of the Latin text,
            and gives brief paraphrases of two passages that total 17 lines. It is an eminently
            actable translation, but I have found no contemporary references to it. Warner
            bowdlerizes Plautus a bit by removing some lines of sexual innuendo and by translating
              meretrix and scortum as
              Gentlewoman or woman.

          The quarto is well printed; a few editorial adjustments are in square brackets. So as
            to make placement of signatures and other references most visible, the text preserves
            the lineation of Q, except for sigs. A4 and A4v where a few
            lines are indented by display capitals P (A4) and I (A4v).
            Q’s conventional use of italic and roman faces has been followed, except that when the
            compositor(s) ran out of, chiefly, italic letters and substituted roman or swash
            letters, the fonts are normalized. Occasionally, punctuation and spacing have also been
            normalized. Signatures appear in the right margin. TLN references in the right margin
            are to the Commentary where Warner is identified or quoted. The text is taken from the
            microfilm of STC 20002. Parallels with Err. have been noted at the following TLNs: 0, 2, 45 (Epidamium), 131 (retain’d his name), 133 (a loue), 135–7, 170–1, 197–204, 203–4, 252, 263–8, 263–4, 363–4, 377,

                The writer hereof (louing Readers) having diuerse of this Poettes
                  Comedies Englished, for the vse and delight of his priuate friends, who in Plautus owne words are not able to vnderstand them: I have
                  preuailed so far with him as to let this one go farther abroad, for a publike
                  recreation and delight to all those, that affect the diuerse sorts of bookes
                  compiled in this kind, wherof (in my iudgement) in harmelesse mirth and quicknesse
                  of fine conceit, the most of them come far short of this. And although I found him
                  very loath and vnwilling to hazard this to the curious view of enuious detraction,
                  (being as he tels mee) neither so exactly written, as it may carry any name of a
                  Translation, nor such libertie therin vsed, as that he would notoriously varie
                  from the Poets owne order: yet sith it is onely a matter of meriment, and the
                  litle alteration therof, can breede no detriment of importance, I have ouer-rulde
                  him so farre, as to let this be offred to your curteous acceptance, and if you
                  shall applaude his litle labour heerein, I doubt not but he will endeuour to
                  gratifie you with some of the rest better laboured, and more curiously
                    pollished.Farewell.

                  [Warner does not translate the Prologue, which is taken here from Nixon (tr.
                    1917, 2:367, 369, 371).]

                  First and foremost, spectators, I am the bearer of the very best wishes
                    for—myself and—you. I bring you Plautus, orally, not corporally, and I pray you
                    receive him with amiable ears. Lend me your attention and learn our argument
                    now; I will frame it in the fewest possible words.

                  Now writers of comedy have this habit: they always allege that the scene of
                    action is Athens, their object being to give the play a more Grecian air. As for
                    me, I will report the scene as being nowhere, save where, by report, the events
                    occurred. And though this argument is à la Greek, yet it is not à l’Attic but
                    rather à la Sicilian. So much by way of antelude to this argument; now I will
                    give you your rations of the argument itself, not by the peck or three peck
                    measure, but by the very granary—such is my generosity in giving arguments!

                  There was a certain old merchant in Syracuse who had twin sons born him, so
                    much alike that their foster mother who suckled them could not distinguish them,
                    nor even their real mother who gave them birth—so I was told, at least, by a man
                    who had seen the boys; I myself have not seen them, and none of you is to
                    suppose I have. When the boys were now seven years old, their father loaded a
                    large ship with many articles of [369] merchandise; one
                    twin he put aboard and took away with himself to Tarentum, his place of trade,
                    the other being left with his mother at home. At Tarentum it happened they were
                    having a festival when he arrived. Many people had congregated, as they do at
                    festivals; the boy strayed from his father in the crowd. A certain merchant of
                    Epidamnus was there; this merchant picked the boy up and took him off to
                    Epidamnus. As for the father, after he lost his son he was broken-hearted and
                    died of grief at Tarentum a few days later.

                  When news of all this—how the boy was stolen and his father dead at
                    Tarentum—got back to Syracuse to the boys’ grandfather, he changed the name of
                    this other twin. See what a deep affection he had for that other boy, the stolen
                    one! He gave that boy’s name to the one at home, calling him Menaechmus, the
                    name of his lost brother. This was the name of the grandfather himself,
                      too,—(confidentially) I remember his name the more
                    easily for having seen him vociferously dunned. To keep you from going astray
                    later, I herewith forewarn you—both twins have the same name.

                  Now I must (chuckling) foot it back to Epidamnus so as
                    to clarify this situation for you perfectly. If any one of you should want any
                    business transacted for him in Epidamnus, command me freely and speak out—that
                    is, in case you furnish the wherewithal for the transaction. For if a man has
                    not furnished the necessary funds, it will come to nothing; if he has furnished
                    them, it will come to—less than nothing. However, I return to the place I left,
                    yes, and without stirring a step.

                  [371] That Epidamnian I mentioned some time ago, who
                    stole that other twin, had no children at all except his money. He adopted that
                    kidnapped boy and gave him a wife with a dowry, and made him his heir by his own
                    demise. For he happened one day to be going to the country after a heavy rain,
                    and while he was trying to ford a rapid stream quite near the city, the rapids
                    rapt the feet of the boy’s abductor from beneath him and swept him off to
                    perdition. His enormous fortune fell to his adopted son. And there it is (pointing to the house) that this stolen twin lives.

                  Now that twin whose home is in Syracuse will come to-day to Epidamnus, with his
                    servant, in search of this twin brother of his. This city (with a wave toward the houses on the stage) is Epidamnus, during the
                    presentation of this play; when another play is presented it will become another
                    town. It is quite like the way in which families, too, are wont to change their
                    homes: now a pimp lives here, now a young gentleman, now an old one, now a poor
                    man, a beggar, a king, a parasite, a seer[.]

              A Pleasant and Fine Con­ ceited Comædie called
                  Menechmus, taken out of the most
                  excellent Poet Plautus.


              

                
                  Act. 1. Scene. 1.

                  Enter Peniculus a Parasite.

                  
                    [Pen.]
                    Peniculus was giuen mee for my name when I was yong,
                      bicause like a broome I swept all cleane away, where so ere I
                      become: Namely all the vittels which are set before mee. Now in my
                      iudgement, men that clap iron bolts on such captiues as they would keepe
                      safe, and tie those seruants in chaines, who they thinke will run away,
                      they commit an exceeding great folly: my reason is, these poore wretches
                      enduring one miserie vpon an other, neuer cease deuising how by wrenching
                      asunder their giues, or by some subtiltie or other they may escape such
                      cursed bands. If then ye would keep a man without all suspition of
                      running away from ye, the surest way is to tie him with meate, drinke,
                      and ease: Let him euer be idle, eate his belly full, and carouse
                      while his skin will hold, and he shall neuer I warrant ye, stir a
                      foote. These strings to tie one by the teeth, passe all the bands of
                      iron, steele, or what mettall so euer, for the more slack and easie ye
                      make them, the faster still they tie the partie which is in them. I
                      speake this vpon experience of my selfe, who am now going for Menechmus, there willingly to be tied to his good
                      cheare: he is commonly so exceeding bountifull and liberall in his fare,
                      as no marueyle though such guestes as my selfe be drawne to his Table,
                      and tyed there in his dishes. [A4v]
                      Now because I haue lately bene a straunger there, I meane to visite
                      him at dinner: for my stomacke mee-thinkes euen thrusts me into the
                      fetters of his daintie fare. But yonder I [see] his doore open, and

                  Scene. 2.

                  Enter Menechmus talking backe to
                    his wife within.

                  
                    [Men.]
                    If ye were not such a brabling foole and mad-braine scold as yee are,
                      yee would neuer thus crosse your husbande in all actions. Tis no matter,
                      let her serue me thus once more, Ile send her home to her dad with a
                      vengeance. I can neuer go foorth a doores, but shee asketh mee whither I
                      go? what I do? what busines? what I fetch? what I carry? * As though she
                      were a Consta­ ble, or a tollgatherer. I haue pamperd her too much:
                      she hath seruants about her, wooll, flax, and all things necessary
                      to busie her withall, yet she watcheth &amp; wondreth whither I go.
                      Well sith it is so, she shall now haue some cause, I mean to dine this
                      day abroad with a sweet friend of mine.

                    Yea mary now comes hee to the point that prickes me: this last speech
                      gaules mee as much as it would doo his wife; If he dine not at home, I am
                      drest.

                        363–4]
                      are miserably hampred, yet would euery man could tame his shrewe as
                      well as I doo mine. I haue now filcht away a fine ryding cloake of my
                      wiues, which I meane to bestow vpon one that I loue better. Nay, if she
                      be so warie and watchfull ouer me, I count it an almes deed to deceiue
                      her.

                      a field this day; we meane to drinke for the heauens: And which of
                      vs performes the brauest seruice at his weopon the wine boll, yourselfe
                      as Captaine shall paie him his wages ac­ cording to his deserts.
                  

                  
                    
                      Erot.

                      Pen.
                    
                    I would we had the weapons, for my valour pricks me to the battaile.
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    Shall I tell thee sweete mouse? I neuer looke vpon thee, but I am quite
                      out of loue with my wife.[tln

                      Eroti.
                    
                    Yet yee cannot chuse, but yee must still weare [B2]
                      something of hers: whats this same?
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    This? such a spoyle (sweete heart) as I tooke from her to put on
                      thee.
                  

                  
                    
                      Ero.
                    
                    Mine owne Menechmus, well woorthie to bee my
                      deare, of all dearest.
                  

                  
                    
                      Pen.
                    
                    Now she showes her selfe in her likenesse, when shee findes him in the
                      giuing vaine, she drawes close to him.
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    I thinke Hercules got not the garter from Hypoli­ ta so hardly, as I got this from my
                      wife. Take this, and with the same, take my heart.

                    Thus they must do that are right Louers: especially if they mean to [be]
                      beggers with any speed.
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    I bought this same of late for my wife, it stood mee (I thinke) in some

                  Act. 2. Scen[e]. 1.

                  Enter Menechmus,
                      Sosicles. Messenio his seruant, and some Saylers.

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    Surely Messenio, I thinke Sea-fairers neuer take
                      so comfortable a ioy in any thing, as when they haue bene long tost
                      and turmoyld in the wide seas, they hap at last to ken land.
                  

                  
                    
                      Mess.
                    
                    Ile be sworn, I shuld not be gladder to see a whole Country of mine
                      owne, then I haue bene at such a sight. But I pray, wherfore are we now
                      come to Epidamnum? must we needs go to see euerie
                      Towne that we heare off?
                  

                  
                    
                      Menech.
                    
                    Till I finde my brother, all Townes are alike to me: I must trie in all
                      places.
                  

                  
                    
                      Mess.
                    
                    Why then let’s euen as long as wee liue seeke your brother: six yeares
                      now haue we roamde about thus, Istria,[tln
                        135–7]
                      Hispania, Massylia, Ilyria, all the vpper sea, all high Greece, all Hauen Towns in Italy, I think
                      if we had sought a needle all this time, we must needs haue found it, had
                      it bene aboue ground. It cannot be that he is aliue, and to seek a dead
                      man [B3]
                      thus among the liuing, what folly is it?
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    Yea, could I but once find any man that could cer­ tainly enforme me
                      of his death, I were satisfied; otherwise I can neuer desist seeking:
                      Litle knowest thou Messenio how neare my heart it
                      goes.
                  

                  
                    
                      Mess.
                    
                    This is washing of a Blackamore. Faith let’s goe home,vnlesse ye meane
                      we should write a storie of our tra­ uaile.
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    Sirra, no more of these sawcie speeches, I perceiue I must teach ye how
                      to serue me, not to rule me.
                  

                  
                    
                      Mess.
                    
                    I, so, now it appeares what it is to be a seruant. Wel[tln
                        252]
                      yet I must speake my conscience. Do ye heare sir? Faith I must tell
                      ye one thing, when I looke into the leane estate of your purse, and
                      consider aduisedly of your decaying stocke, I hold it verie needfull to
                      be drawing homeward, lest in loo­[tln
                        203–4]
                      king your brother, we quite lose ourselues. For this assure[tln
                        263–8]
                      your selfe, this Towne Epidamnum, is a place of
                      outragious expences, exceeding in all ryot and lasciuiousnesse: and (I
                      heare) as full of Ribaulds, Parasites, Drunkards, Catchpoles,
                      Cony-catchers, and Sycophants, as it can hold: then for Cur­
                      tizans, why here’s the currantest stamp of them in the world. Ye
                      must not thinke here to scape with as light cost as in o­ 
                      ther places. The verie name shews the nature, no man comes[tln
                        2]
                      hither sine damno.
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    Yee say very well indeed: giue mee my purse into mine owne keeping,
                      because I will so be the safer, sine damno.
                  

                  
                    
                      Mess.
                    
                    Why sir?
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    Because I feare you wil be busie among the Cur­ tizans, &amp; so be
                      cosened of it: then should I take great paines in belabouring your
                      shoulders, so to auoid both these harms, Ile keep it my selfe.
                  

                  
                    
                      Mess.
                    
                    I pray do so sir, all the better.

                     Iest or earnest, this I tell ye for a truth. I neuer had wife, neither
                      haue I, nor neuer was in this place till this in­ stant: for only

                    Marry ile tell ye, an old rotten weather-beaten ship, that we haue saild
                      vp and downe in this sixe yeares, Ist not time to be going homewards

                    Come, come, Menechmus, I pray leaue this sporting
                      and go in.

                    Well Gentlewoman, the truth is, you mistake my person, it is some other
                      that you looke for.

                    Why, thinke ye I know ye not to be Menechmus, the
                      sonne of Moschus, and haue heard ye say, ye were borne
                      at Syracusis, where Agathocles did raigne, then Pythia, then
                        Liparo, and now Hiero.
                  

                  
                    
                      Men.
                    
                    All this is true.

                    Either shee is a witch, or else shee hath dwelt there and knew ye
                      there.

                    Why so? I warrant thee, I can loose nothing, som­ what I shall
                      gaine, perhaps a good lodging during my abode heere. Ile dissemble with
                      her an other while. Nowe when you please let vs go in, I made straunge
                      with you, because of this fellow here, least he should tell my wife of
                      the cloake which I gaue you.

                    Not I, Ile neither staie for him, nor haue him let come in, if he do
                      come.
                  

                  
                    
                      Erot.
                    
                    All the better. But sir, will yee doo one thing for me?

                    What is that?
                  

                  
                    
                      Ero.

                Act. 3.

                Enter Peniculus.

                
                  [Pen.]
                  * Twentie yeares I thinke and more, haue I playde the knaue, yet neuer
                    playd I the foolish knaue as I haue done this morning. I follow Menechmus, and he goes to the Hall where now the
                    Sessions are holden: there thru­ sting our selues into the prease of
                    people, when I was in midst of all the throng, he gaue me the slip, that I
                    could ne­ uer more set eye on him, and I dare sweare, came directly
                    to dinner. That I would he that first deuised these Sessions were
                    hang’d, and all that euer came of him: tis such a hinde­ rance to men
                    that haue belly businesses in hand. If a man be not there at his call, they
                    amearce him with a vengeance. Men that haue nothing else to do, that do
                    neither bid anie man, nor are themselues bidden to dinner, such should come
                    to Sessions, not we that haue these matters to looke too. If it were
                    so, I had not thus lost my dinner this day, which I think in my conscience
                    he did euen purposely couzen me off. Yet I meane to go see: if I can but
                    light vppon the reuersion, I may perhaps get my peny-worthes. But how now?
                    is this Menechmus comming away from thence? dinner
                    done, and all dispacht? What execrable lucke haue I?
                

                Enter Menechmus the
                  trauailer.

                
                  [Men.]
                  Tush I warrant ye, it shall be done as ye would wish, Ile haue it so
                    altered and trimd anew, that it shall by no meanes be knowne againe.
                

                
                  
                    Pen.
                  
                  He carries the cloake to the Dyars, dinner done, the wine drunke vp, the
                    Parasite shut out of doores. Well, let me liue no longer, but ile reuenge
                    this iniurious mockerie. But first ile harken awhile what he saith.
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  Good goddes, who euer had such lucke as I? Such cheare, such a dinner,
                    such kinde entertainment: And for a farewell, this cloake which I meane
                    shall go with me.

                  He speakes so softly, I cannot heare what hee saith, I am sure he is now
                    flowting at me for the losse of my din­ ner.

                  She tels me how I gaue it her, and stole it from my wife. When I perceiued
                    she was in an error, though I knew not how, I began to sooth her, and to
                    say euery thing as she said. Meane while I far’d well, and that [at?] a
                    free cost.

                    Men.
                  
                  Neither haue I wife, neither gaue I any cloake to Erotium, neither filcht I any from any bodie.

                  It makes mee wonder, to see how euery one that meetes me cauils thus with
                    me. Wherefore comes foorth the mayd now?
                

                Enter Ancilla, Erotiums mayd.

                    take this Chaine with you, and put it to mending at the Goldsmythes, shee
                    would haue two or three ounces of gold more in it, and the fashion
                    amended.

                    Men.
                  
                  Faith, when I gaue this, I gaue them too.

                    Men.

                    make the best hand I can of them. Is she gone? Doo not all the gods
                    conspire to loade mee with good lucke? well I see tis high time to get mee
                    out of these coasts, least all these matters should be lewd deuises to draw
                    me into some snare. There shall my garland lie, because if they seeke
                    me, they may thinke that I am gone that way. * I wil now goe see if I can
                    finde my man Messenio, that I may tell him how I
                    haue sped.
                

              



              
                Act. 4.

                Enter Mulier, the
                  wife of Menechmus the Citizen, and Peniculus.

                
                  
                    Mulier.
                  
                  Thinkes he I will be made such a sot, and to be still his drudge, while he
                    prowles and purloynes all that I haue to giue his Trulles?
                

                
                  
                    Pen.
                  
                  Nay hold your peace, wee’ll catch him in the nicke. This way he came, in
                    his garland forsooth, bearing the cloak to the Dyars. And see I pray where
                    the garland lyes, this way he is gone. See, see, where he comes againe now
                    with­ out the cloake.
                

                
                  
                    Mul.
                  
                  What shall I now do?
                

                
                  
                    Pen.
                  
                  What? that which ye euer do, bayt him for life.
                

                
                  
                    Mul.
                  
                  Surely I thinke it best so.
                

                
                  
                    Pen.
                  
                  Stay, wee will stand aside a little, ye shall catch him vnawares.
                

                Enter Menechmus the
                  Citizen.

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  It would make a man at his wittes end, to see how brabbling causes are
                    handled yonder at the Court. If a poore man neuer so honest, haue a matter
                    come to be scand, there is hee outfaste, and ouerlaide with countenance: If
                    a [C4]
                    rich man neuer so vile a wretch come to speake, there they are all
                    readie to fauour his cause. What with facing out bad causes for the
                    oppressors, and patronizing some iust actions for the wronged, the Lawyers
                    they pocket vp all the gaines. For mine own part, I come not away emptie,
                    though I haue bene kept long against my will: For taking in hand to
                    dis­ patch a matter this morning for one of my acquaintaunce, I
                    was no sooner entered into it, but his aduersaries laide so hard vnto his
                    charge, and brought such matter against him, that do what I could, I could
                    not winde my selfe out til now. I am sore afrayed Erotium thinks much vnkindnes in me that I staid so long, yet she
                    will not be angry considering the gift I gaue her to day.

                    Mul.
                  
                  I say, when thou hast anie thing stolne from thee, come to me, and I will

                  God a mercy for nothing, that can neuer be, for I haue nothing in the
                    world worth the stealing. So now with husband and wife and all, I am cleane
                    out of fauour. A mis­ chiefe on ye all.

                  My wife thinks she is notably reueng’d on me, now she shuttes mee out of
                    doores, as though I had not a better place to be welcome too. If she shut
                    me out, I know who wil shut me in. Now will I entreate Erotium to let me haue the cloake againe to stop my wiues mouth
                    withall, and then will I prouide a better for her. Ho who is within there?
                    some­ bodie tell Erotium I must speake with
                    her.

                  Wot ye what? my wife knowes all the matter now, and my comming is, to
                    request you, that I may haue againe the cloake which I brought you, that so
                    I may appease her: and I promise you, ile giue ye an other worth two of
                    it.

                  Gaue mee the cloake and your chaine? In truth I neuer sawe ye since I left
                    it heere with you, and so went to the Sessions, from whence I am but now
                    returned.
                

                
                  
                    Erot.
                  
                  Ah then sir, I see you wrought a deuice to defraude mee of them both, did
                    I therefore put yee in trust? Well, well.
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  To defraud ye? No, but I say, my wife hath intelli­ gence of the
                    matter.

                  Why sir, I asked them not, ye brought them me of your owne free motion.
                    Now ye require them againe, take them, make sops of them: you and your wife
                    togither, think ye I esteeme them or you either. Goe, come to mee againe
                    when I send for you.

                  What gone in chafing, and clapt to the doores? now I am euerie way shut
                    out for a very benchwhistler: neither shall I haue entertainment heere nor
                    at home. I were best go trie some other friends, and aske counsaile what to
                    do.

                Act. 5.

                Enter Menechmus the
                  Traueller, Mulier.

                
                  [Men.]
                  Most foolishly was I ouerseene in giuing my purse and[tln
                      170–1]
                    money to Messenio, whom I can no where find, I feare
                    he is fallen into some lewd companie.
                

                
                  
                    Mul.
                  
                  I maruaile that my husband comes not yet, but see where he is now, and
                    brings my cloake with him.
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  I muse where the knaue should be.
                

                
                  
                    Mul.
                  
                  I will go ring a peale through both his eares for this[tln
                      505–41]
                    his dishonest behauiour. Oh sir, ye are welcome home with your
                    theeuery on your shoulders, are ye not ashamde to let all the world see and
                    speake of your lewdnesse?
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  How now? what lackes this woman?
                

                
                  
                    Mul.
                  
                  Impudent beast, stand ye to question about it? For shame hold thy
                    peace.
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  What offence haue I done woman, that I should not speake to you?
                

                
                  
                    Mulier.
                  
                  Askest thou what offence? O shamelesse bold­ nesse!
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  Good woman, did ye neuer heare why the Greci­ ans termed Hecuba to be a bitch?
                

                
                  
                    Mul.
                  
                  Neuer.
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  Because she did as you do now, on whom soeuer she met withall, she railed,
                    and therfore well deserued that dog­ ged name.
                

                
                  
                    Mul.
                  
                  These foule abuses and contumelies, I can neuer en­ dure, nay rather
                    will I liue a widowes life to my dying day.
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  What care I whether thou liuest as a widow or as a wife? This passeth,
                    that I meet with none but thus they vexe me with straunge speeches.
                

                
                  
                    Mul.
                  
                  What straunge speeches? I say I will surely liue a widowes life, rather
                    then suffer thy vile dealings.
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  Prethee for my part, liue a widow till the worldes end, if thou wilt.
                

                
                  
                    Mulier.
                  
                  Euen now thou deniedst that thou stolest it from [D3]
                    me, and now thou bringest it home openly in my sight. Art not
                    ashamde?
                

                
                  
                    Men.
                  
                  Woman, you are greatly to blame to charge mee with stealing of this
                    cloake, which this day an other gaue me to carry to be trimde.
                

                
                  
                    Mul.

                  How now? they will carry mee in if I looke not to my selfe: I were best to
                    skare them better yet. Doest thou bid me Phœbus, to
                    teare this dog in peeces with my nayles? If I laie hold on him, I will do
                    thy commandment.

                  She is gone: yea Appollo I will sacrifice this olde
                    beast vnto thee: and if thou commandest mee, I will cut his throate
                    with that dagger that hangs at his girdle.

                  Yea I will quarter him, and pull all the bones out of his flesh, then will
                    I barrell vp his bowels.
                

                
                  
                    Sen.

                  Many things thou commandest me Appollo, wouldst
                    thou haue me harnesse vp these wilde horses, and then clime vp into
                    the Chariot, &amp; so ouer-ride this old stincking tooth­ lesse Lyon.
                    So now I am in the Chariot, and I haue hold on the raines, here is my whip,
                    hait [i.e., a cry], come ye wilde Iades, make a [E1]
                    hideous noyse with your stamping: hait I say; will ye not go?

                  Harke, now Appollo bids mee ride ouer him that
                    stands there, and kill him. How now? who pulles mee downe from my
                    Chariot by the haires of my head. Oh shall I not fulfill Appolloes commandment?

                  See, see, what a sharpe disease this is, and how well he was euen now. I
                    will fetch a Phisitian straight, before hee grow too farre into this

                  The proofe of a good seruant, is to regard his maisters businesse as well
                    in his absence, as in his presence: and I thinke him a verie foole that is
                    not carefull as well for his [E2v]
                    ribbes and shoulders, as for his belly and throate. When I think vpon
                    the rewards of a sluggard, I am euer pricked with a carefull regard of my
                    backe and shoulders: for in truth I haue no fancie to these blows, as many
                    a one hath: methinks it is no pleasure to a man to be basted with a ropes

          Amphitruo and the Supposita

          Foakes (ed.
            1962, p. xxvii) summarizes the plot of Amphitruo:
              Jupiter takes the place of Amphitryon in his house, and sleeps with his wife,
              Alcmena, who believes she is with her husband. Meanwhile, Mercury adopts the
              appearance of Amphitryon’s slave, Sosia, and first confuses, then drives away the real
              Sosia. A little later, Mercury, still Sosia in appearance, abuses Amphitryon when he
              knocks at the door of his own house and is not allowed to enter. In this play there
              are two pairs of twins, masters and servants, who cannot be distinguished by their
              friends or by Alcmena.

          What has not been printed for about a century is an addition to the authentic Amphitruo to make up for a lacuna between 4.2.16 and the beginning
            of Act 5, a gap of about 225 lines. The addition, written by Hermolaus Barbarus, was
            printed in 16th-c. editions, one of which Sh. presumably studied. In Lambinus’s ed.
            (1576), which Baldwin identifies as the one Sh. read (see n. 0), the first few lines are printed in italics, with a warning
            that the best manuscripts do not contain the addition, but that Lambinus intends to
            print the lines, siue sint Plauti, siue non sint. This
            addition came to be called Supposita in 19th-c. scholarly editions in recognition of its
            being a late, non-Plautine text, or else it was dropped as spurious, so that the lines
            have been ignored in more recent source studies. Gill (1930, pp. 52–5): This reconstruction was made by Hermolaus Barbarus, Cardinal of Aquileja
              (1464–1493), to be used when the Amphitruo was played in Rome
              and Florence. . . . The author of The Birth of Hercules
              (about 1600) follows quite closely these reconstructed scenes, translating or
              paraphrasing the greater part of them. . . . [53] It seems
              very probable to me that Shakespeare was familiar with them. . . . 

          [54] In studying these characters I have
              suggested that the rôle of Balthazar . . . is not unlike that of Blepharo [quotes
                755–8 of the
              authentic text]. . . . 

          [55] The altercation over the closed door, the
              talk of sorcery and transformation, Amphitruo’s doubting his identity, and, more
              particularly, Blepharo’s activity as peacemaker, are suggestive of Shakespeare’s play,
              and of this interpolation.

          The following prose translation (tr. Riley, 1910, pp. 47–57) of the lines added to 16th-c. editions of Amphitruo is used because no modern editions include the Supposita.
            The addition begins after line 1034. Italicized words are not in the Latin, but are
            added by Riley to achieve clarity or idiomatic English. No standard line numbering
            exists; page numbers in brackets are those of the translation. TLN references inserted
            in the text identify nn. that discuss the Supposita. I reprint the whole passage because
            Sh. would have read it (in Latin) and because of its rarity.

                    Amph.
                    [tln
                      651–745] What, you, devote
                      me, you villain? If the Gods have not this day taken away my usual form, I’ll take care that you shall be laden with bull’s hide
                        thongs, you victim of [48]Saturn. So
                      surely will I devote you to the cross and to torture. Come out of doors, you
                      whip-knave.

                    You shadowy ghost—you, frighten me with your threats?
                      If you don’t betake yourself off from here this instant, if you knock once
                      more, if the door makes a noise with your little finger even, I’ll break your head with this tile, so that with your teeth you
                      may sputter out your tongue.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    What, rascal, would you be for driving me away [tln
                      729] from my own house? What,
                        would you hinder me from knocking at my own door?
                      I’ll this instant tear it from off all its hinges.
                  

                  
                    Merc.
                    Do you persist?
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    I do persist.
                  

                  
                    Merc.
                    Take that, then. (Throws a tile at him.)
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Scoundrel! at your master? If I lay hands upon you this day, I’ll bring you
                      to that pitch of misery, that you shall be miserable for evermore.
                  

                  
                    Merc.
                    Surely, you must have been playing the Bacchanal, old
                      gentleman.

                    Amph.
                    What? I—take you? Merc. Plague upon you! I know no
                      master but Amphitryon.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    (to himself.) Have I
                      lost my form? It’s strange that Sosia shouldn’t know me. I’ll make trial.
                        (Calling out). How
                      now! Tell me who I appear to be? Am I not really
                      Amphitryon?
                  

                  
                    Merc.
                    Amphitryon? Are you in your senses? Has it not been told you before, old
                      fellow, that you have been playing the Bacchanal, to be asking another person
                      who you are? Get away, I recommend you, don’t be troublesome while Amphitryon,
                      who has just come back from the enemy, is indulging himself with the company of his wife.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    What wife?
                  
                  
                    Merc.

                    Amph.
                    What man?
                  
                  
                    Merc.
                    How often do you want it told? Amphitryon, my master; —don’t be
                      troublesome.

                    Amph.

                    Merc.
                    Take care that you don’t meet with some mishap in trifling with me this
                      way.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Prithee, do tell me, my dear Sosia.
                  

                  
                    Merc.

                    Amph.
                    In the same chamber?
                  

                  
                    Merc.
                    Yes, as I fancy, he is sleeping with her side by side.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Alas! — wretch that I am!

                        Audience). It really
                      is a gain which he imagines to be a misfortune. For to lend one’s wife to
                      another is just as though you were to let out barren land to be ploughed.

                    What, the plague, about Sosia?
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Don’t you know me, you whip-scoundrel?
                  

                  
                    Merc.
                    I know that you are a troublesome fellow, who have no need to go buy a
                      lawsuit.
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    Still once more—am I not your master Amphitryon?
                  

                  
                    Merc.
                    You are Bacchus himself, and
                      not Amphitryon. How often do you want to be told? Any times more? My master Amphitryon, in the same chamber, is holding
                      Alcmena in his embraces. If you persist, I’ll produce him here, and not
                      without your great discomfiture.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    I wish him to be fetched. (Aside.) I pray that this day, in return for my services, I
                      may not lose house, wife, and household, together with
                      my figure.
                  

                  
                    Merc.
                    Well, I’ll fetch him; but, in the meantime, do you mind about the door,
                      please. (Aside.) I
                      suppose that by this he has brought the sacrifice that he was intending, as
                      far as the banquet. (Aloud.) If you are troublesome, you shan’t escape without my
                      making a sacrifice of you. (He retires
                          into the house.)
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Ye Gods, by my trust in you, what madness is distracting my household? What
                      wondrous things have I seen since I arrived from abroad! Why, it’s true, surely, what was once heard tell of, how that men of
                      Attica [50]were transformed in Arcadia, and
                      remained as savage wild beasts, and were not ever afterwards known unto their
                      parents.
                  

                



                
                  Scene IV.
                  —Enter
                    Blepharo
                    and
                    Sosia, at a distance.

                  
                    Bleph.
                    What’s this, Sosia? Great marvels are these that you are telling of. Do you
                      say that you found another Sosia at home exactly like yourself?
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    I do say so—but, hark you, since I have produced a Sosia, Amphitryon an Amphitryon, how do you know
                      whether you, perchance, may not be producing another Blepharo? O that the Gods
                      would grant that you as well, belaboured with fists, and with your teeth
                      knocked out, going without your breakfast, might credit this. For I, that
                      other Sosia, that is to say, who am yonder, has mauled
                      me in a dreadful manner.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Really, it is wonderful; but it’s as well to mend our pace; for, as I
                      perceive, Amphitryon is waiting for us, and my empty stomach is grumbling.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    (apart).—And why do
                      I mention foreign legends? More wondrous things they relate to have happened among our Theban race in former days; that mighty
                      searcher for Europa, attacking the monster sprung from Mars, suddenly produced
                      his enemies from the serpent-seed; and in that battle fought, brother pressed
                      on brother with lance and helm; the Epirote land, too, beheld the author of
                      our race, together with the daughter of Venus, gliding as serpents. From on
                      high supreme Jove thus willed it; thus destiny directs. All the noblest of our
                      country, in return for their bright achievements, are pursued with direful
                      woes. This fatality is pressing hard on me—still I
                      could endure disasters so great, and submit to woes hardly to be endured—
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    Blepharo.
                  
                  
                    Bleph.
                    What’s the matter?
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    I don’t know; I suspect something wrong.
                  

                  
                    [51]
                    Bleph.
                    Why?
                  
                  
                    Sos.
                    Look, please, our master, like an humble courtier, is
                      walking before the door bolted fast.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    It’s nothing; walking to and fro, he’s looking for an appetite.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    After a singular fashion, indeed; for he has shut the door, that it mayn’t
                      escape out of the house.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    You do go yelping on.
                  
                  
                    Sos.
                    I go neither yelping on nor barking on; if you listen to me, observe him. I
                      don’t know why he’s by himself alone; he’s making some
                      calculation, I suppose. I can hear from this spot what he says—don’t be in a
                      hurry.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    (apart). How much I
                      fear lest the Gods should blot out the glory I have acquired in the conquest
                      of the foe. In wondrous manner do I see the whole of my household in
                      commotion. And then my wife, so full of viciousness,
                      incontinence, and dishonor, kills me outright. But
                      about the goblet, it is a singular thing; yet the seal was properly affixed.
                      And what besides? She recounted to me the battles I had fought; Pterelas, too,
                      besieged and bravely slain by my own hand. Aye, aye—now I know the trick; this
                      was done by Sosia’s contrivance, who as well has disgracefully presumed to-day
                      to get before me on my arrival.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    (to
                        Blepharo). He’s talking about me, and in
                      terms that I had rather not. Prithee, don’t let’s accost this man until he has disclosed his wrath.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Just as you please.
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    (apart). If it is
                      granted me this day to lay hold of that whip-scoundrel, I’ll show him what it
                      is to deceive his master, and to assail me with threats and tricks.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    Do you hear him?
                  
                  
                    Bleph.
                    I hear him.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    That implement (pointing to
                        Amphitryon’s walking-stick) is a burden for my shoulder-blades. Let’s
                      accost the [52]man, if you please. Do you know what is
                      in the habit of being commonly said?
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    What you are going to say, I don’t know; what you’ll have to endure I pretty
                      well guess.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    It’s an old adage—Hunger and delay summon anger to the
                        nostrils.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Aye, and well suited to the occasion. Let’s address him
                      directly—Amphitryon!
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    (looking round). Is
                      it Blepharo I hear? It’s strange why he’s come to me. Still, he presents
                      himself opportunely, for me to prove the guilty conduct of my wife. Why have you come here to me, Blepharo?
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Have you so soon forgotten how early in the morning you sent Sosia to the
                      ship, that I might take a repast with you to-day?
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Never in this world was it done. But where is that scoundrel?
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Who?
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    Sosia.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    See, there he is. (Points at
                          him.)
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    (looking about).
                      Where?
                  
                  
                    Bleph.
                    Before your eyes; don’t you see him?
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    I can hardly see for anger, so distracted has that fellow made me this day.
                      You shall never escape my making a sacrifice of you. (Offers to strike
                        Sosia, on which
                        Blepharo
                        prevents him.) Do let me, Blepharo.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Listen, I pray.
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    Say on, I’m listening—(gives a
                          blow to
                        Sosia) you take that.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    For what reason? Am I not in good time? I couldn’t have gone quicker, if I
                      had betaken myself on the oarlike wings of Dædalus. (Amphitryon
                        tries to strike him again.)
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Prithee, do leave him alone; we couldn’t quicken our pace any further.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Whether it was the pace of a man on stilts or that
                        [53]of the tortoise, I’m determined to be the death of
                      this villain. (Striking him at
                          each sentence.) Take that for the roof; that for the tiles;
                      that for closing the door; that for making fun of your master; that for your
                      abusive language.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    What injury has he been doing to you?
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Do you ask? Shut out of doors, from that housetop (pointing to it) he has driven me away
                      from my house.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    What, I?
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    What did you threaten that you would do if I knocked at that door? Do you
                      deny it, you scoundrel?
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    Why shouldn’t I deny it? See, he’s sufficiently a witness with whom I have
                        just now come; I was sent on purpose that by your
                      invitation I might bring him to your house.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Who sent you, villain?
                  
                  
                    Sos.
                    He who asks me the question.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    When, of all things?
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    Some little time since—not long since—just now. When you were reconciled at
                      home to your wife.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Bacchus must have demented you.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    May I not be paying my respects to Bacchus this day, nor yet to Ceres. You
                      ordered the vessels to be made clean, that you might perform a sacrifice, and
                      you sent me to fetch him (pointing
                          to
                        Blepharo), that he might breakfast with
                      you.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Blepharo, may I perish outright if I have either been in the house, or if I
                      have sent him. (To
                        Sosia) Tell me—where did you leave me?
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    At home, with your wife Alcmena. Leaving you, I flew towards the harbour, and invited him in your name. We are come, and I’ve not
                      seen you since till now.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Villanous fellow! With my wife, say you? You shall
                      never go away without getting a beating. (Gives him a blow.)
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    (crying out).
                      Blepharo!
                  
                  
                    Bleph.
                    Amphitryon, do let him alone, for my sake, and listen to me.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Well, then, I’ll let him alone. What do you want? Say on.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    He has just now been telling me most extraordinary marvels. A juggler, or a
                      sorcerer, perhaps, has en­[54]chanted all this household of
                      yours. Do enquire in other quarters, and examine how it
                      is. And don’t cause this poor fellow to be tortured, before you understand the
                      matter.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    You give good advice; let’s go in, I want you also to
                      be my advocate against my wife. (Knocks at the door.)
                  

                




                
                  Scene V.
                  Enter
                    Jupiter, from the house.

                  
                    Jup.
                    Who with such weighty blows has been shaking the door on all the hinges? Who
                      has been making such a great disturbance for this long while before the house?
                      If I find him out, I’ll sacrifice him to the shades of the Teleboans. There’s
                      nothing, as the common saying is, that goes on well with me to-day. I left
                      Blepharo and Sosia that I might find my kinsman Naucrates; him I have not
                      found, and them I have lost. But I espy them; I’ll go meet them, to enquire if
                      they have any news.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    Blepharo, that’s our master that’s coming out of the house; but this man’s
                      the sorcerer.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    O Jupiter! What do I behold? This is not, but that is, Amphitryon; if this
                      is, why really that cannot be he, unless, indeed, he is double.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    See now, here’s Sosia with Blepharo; I’ll accost them the first. Well, Sosia, come to us at last?
                      I’m quite hungry.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    Didn’t I tell you, Blepharo, that this one was the
                      sorcerer?
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Nay, Theban citizens, I say that this is he (pointing to
                        Jupiter) who in my house has made my wife
                      guilty of incontinence, through whom I find a store of unchastity laid up for me.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    (to
                        Jupiter). Master, if now you are hungry,
                      crammed full of fisticuffs, I betake me to you.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Do you persist, whip-scoundrel?
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    Hie thee to Acheron, sorcerer.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    What, I a sorcerer? (Strikes
                          him.) Take that.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    What madness possesses you, stranger, for you to be
                      beating my servant?
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Your servant?
                  
                  
                    Jup.
                    Mine.
                  

                  
                    [55]
                    Amph.
                    You lie.
                  
                  
                    Jup.
                    Sosia, go in-doors, and take care the breakfast is got
                      ready while I’m sacrificing this fellow.
                  

                  
                    Sos.
                    I’ll go. (Aside.)
                      Amphitryon, I suppose, will receive the other
                      Amphitryon as courteously as I, that other Sosia, did me, Sosia, a while ago.
                      Meantime, while they are contending, I’ll turn aside into the victualling
                      department: I’ll clean out all the dishes, and all the vessels I’ll drain.
                        (Goes into the house.)
                  

                



                
                  Scene VI.
                  —Jupiter, Amphitryon, and
                    Blepharo.

                  
                    Jup.
                    Do you say that I lie?
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    You lie, I say, you corrupter of my family.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    For that disgraceful speech, I’ll drag you along here, seizing you by the
                      throat. (Seizes him by the
                          throat.)
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Ah wretched me!
                  
                  
                    Jup.
                    But you should have had a care of this beforehand.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Blepharo, aid me!
                  
                  
                    Bleph.
                    (aside). The two are
                      so exactly alike that I don’t know which to side with. Still, so far as
                      possible, I’ll put an end to their contention. (Aloud.) Amphitryon, don’t slay Amphitryon in
                      fight; let go his throat, I pray.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    Are you calling this fellow Amphitryon?
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Why not? Formerly he was but one, but now he has become double. While you are
                      wanting to be he, the other, too, doesn’t cease to be of his form. Meanwhile,
                      prithee, do leave go of his neck.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    I will leave go. (Lets go of
                        Amphitryon.) But tell me, does that other
                      fellow appear to you to be Amphitryon?
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Really, both of you do.
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    O supreme Jupiter! when this day didst thou take from me my form? I’ll
                      proceed to make enquiry of him; are you Amphitryon?
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    Do you deny it?
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    Downright do I deny it, inasmuch as in Thebes there is no other Amphitryon
                      besides myself.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    On the contrary, no other besides myself; and, in fact, do you, Blepharo, be
                      the judge.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    I’ll make the matter clear by proofs, if I can. (To
                        Amphitryon.) Do you answer first.
                  

                  
                    [56]
                    Amph.
                    With pleasure.
                  
                  
                    Bleph.
                    Before the battle with the Taphians was begun by you, what orders did you
                      give me?
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    The ship being in readiness, for you carefully to keep close to the
                      rudder.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    That if our people should take to flight, I might betake myself in safety
                      thither.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Anything else as well?
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    That the bag loaded with treasure should be carefully guarded.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    Because the money—
                  
                  
                    Bleph.
                    Hold your tongue, you, if you please; it’s my place to ask. Did you know the
                      amount?
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    Fifty Attic talents.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    He tells the truth to a nicety. And you (to
                        Amphitryon), how many Philippeans?
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Two thousand.
                  
                  
                    Jup.
                    And obols twice as many.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Each of you states the matter correctly. Inside the bag one of you must have been shut up.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    Attend, please. With this right hand, as you know, I slew king Pterelas; his
                      spoils I seized, and the goblet from which he had been used to drink I brought
                      away in a casket; I made a present of it to my wife, with whom this day at
                      home I bathed, I sacrificed, and slept.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Ah me! what do I hear? I scarcely am myself. For, awake, I am asleep; awake,
                      I am in a dream; alive and well, I come to destruction. I am that same
                      Amphitryon, the descendant of Gorgophone, the general of the Thebans, and the
                      sole combatant for Creon against the Teleboans; I, who
                      have subdued by my might the Acarnanians and the Taphians, and, by my
                      consummate warlike prowess, their king. Over these have I appointed Cephalus,
                      the son of the great Deioneus.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    I am he who by warfare and my valour crushed the hostile ravagers. They had
                      destroyed Electryon and the brothers of my wife. Wandering through the Ionian,
                      the [57]Ægean, and the Cretan seas, with piratical violence
                      they laid waste Achaia, Ætolia, and Phocis.
                  

                  
                    Amph.
                    Immortal Gods! I cannot trust my own self, so exactly does he relate all the
                      things that happened there. Consider, Blepharo.
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    One thing only remains; if so it is, do you be
                      Amphitryons both of you.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    I knew what you would say. The scar that I have on the
                      muscle of my right arm, from the wound which Pterelas gave me—
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Well, that.
                  
                  
                    Amph.
                    Quite to the purpose.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    See you! look, behold!
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    Uncover, and I’ll look.
                  

                  
                    Jup.
                    We have uncovered. Look! (They
                          show their naked arms.)
                  

                  
                    Bleph.
                    (looking at the right arm of
                          each). Supreme Jupiter, what do I behold? On the right-arm
                      muscle of each, in the same spot, the scar clearly appears with the same mark,
                      reddish and somewhat livid, just as it has first commenced to close. Reasoning
                      is at a standstill, all judgment is struck dumb; I
                      don’t know what to do.
                  

                
              

            
          


        





        
          Shakespeare’s Use of Plautus



          
            General Indebtedness

            To begin with Sh.’s debt to Plautus’s Menaechmi beyond the
              mere notice of additions and subtractions such as Hertzberg (ed. 1870, 8:189)
              offers (wife’s father, parasite, cook, and maid missing from Err.; Solinus, Egeon, Balthazar, Angelo, the Abbess, Luciana, and
              especially the second Dromio added to Err.), the fullest
              exposition is Gill’s (1930), which lays out the parallels so well that no one has
              had to redo the project. Her conclusion sensibly claims that Sh. (p. 59) seems
                to have assimilated thoroughly the two classical comedies; he has made a
                remarkable—probably unconscious—selection of details, has added to these some
                entirely new elements and a touch, at the beginning and the end, of an old tale, and
                has moulded the whole into an excellently plotted play. This modest
              description does much to deflect objections that she has found detailed influences
              which, if she were to have said they were entirely conscious manipulations of the two
              plays, would have defied credibility.

            Whether Sh. used Warner rather than Latin Plautus causes comment, as the issue of
              Sh.’s Latinity mentioned above demonstrates. Ritson (in Steevens, ed. 1793): I am
                possibly singular in thinking that Shakspeare was not under the slightest
                obligation, in forming this comedy, to Warner’s translation of the Menæchmi. . . .  He has not a name, line or word, from the old play, nor
                any incident but what must, of course, be common to every translation.
              Isaac (1884,
              p. 28), after comparing many parallel passages in Warner and Err.—most are too faint to be useful—and after comparing the treatment of
              the characters common to both plays, concludes that Sh.’s play is the altogether
              richer version, even if Sh. knew Warner; he does not consider the Latin play. Cuningham (ed.
              1907, pp. xxv ff.) gathers 14 passages from Warner which may be considered with
                much reason to have been in Shakespeare’s mind when engaged on the composition of
                his Errors.
              Baldwin
              (ed. 1928, p. xvii n.): A curious illustration of Warner’s stage eye is the spinter of Plautus, which Cooper defines as
                  A . . . bracelet. But a bracelet is not spectacular enough for the
                stage duty to which Shakespeare wishes to put this piece of jewelry, so he changes
                it to a chain, seemingly of aldermanic proportions, to be worn with flaunting
                visibility around the neck. And a chain it becomes in Warner, for no apparent reason
                unless it be whim, or an echo of Shakespeare.

            Tannenbaum
              (1932, pp. 103–5) adds phrases from Warner that have counterparts in Err.: pulses beate so sore ( above; TLN 1336);
                his eies sparkle: they rowle in his head; his colour goes and comes: he
                lookes wildly (; TLN 1381); and threatens to pull out mine
                eyes (; TLN 1392).

            Foakes (ed.
              1962, pp. xxv f.): It is possible that Shakespeare had seen [Warner]. . . . It
                is written in lively prose, and reveals some parallels with The
                  Comedy of Errors, for example, in echoes of words like patch [654], stale [377], and harlots [1682]; in an emphasis on madness; in the suggestion that [xxvi] Erotium is a witch (this is not in the Latin); and in the phrase
                  birds that bear feathers, or fishes that have fins (Latin avis squamosas, piscis pennatos, l. 918; i.e. birds with
                scales, fish with feathers), which could have suggested the line, [743]. He notices the substitution
              of the chain for Plautus’s bracelet (see n. 382). However, even those who have made as much as possible of the
                verbal similarities have not been able to build up a convincing case that
                Shakespeare knew Warner’s translation; indeed, the reverse could be true, that
                Warner echoed Shakespeare.

            No recent commentator believes that Sh. used Warner rather than Plautus.

            Gildon’s
              acknowledgment of Amphitruo above is noticed apparently only
              by Baldwin
              (ed. 1928, p. xx n.). Idem (Genetics, 1965, p. 210): The
                earliest reference works had connected Amphitruo with
                  Menaechmi as sources of Errors.
                But the connection dropped out of the eighteenth-century tradition and was
                halfheartedly reinstated only in the second half of the nineteenth. The early
                reference works, however, had not specified the details of the relationship. The
                first to specify both the doubled twins and the shut-out husband was Moritz Rapp [in
                  Shakspere, ed. Keller &amp; Rapp, 1843,
              7:3–4].

            Occasionally, the influence of Amphitruo reappears. In
              addition to Halliwell (ed. 1854, p. 445) above are the following: Klingelhöffer
              (1873, p. 20): The idea of adding twin slaves . . . is probably taken from the Amphitryon (Fr.). He predates Wislicenus (1879), who now is
              usually credited with this discovery. Wislicenus particularly points
              (p. 91) to two lines from the Supposita, Tun’, furcifur, meis procul prohibessis aedibus? | Tun’ meas pulsare foreis? hasce
                illico toto demoliar cardine (What, rascal, would you be for driving me away from my own house? What, would you hinder me from knocking at my own door. I’ll this
                instant tear it from off all its hinges; ). He likens them to Err.
              729. See n. 729. For other similarities in the authentic play that he
              points to, see nn. 2, 209–59, 651–745, 864–5, 1343–8.

            Gaw (Evolution, 1926, p. 625) cautions against thinking the use of
                Amphitruo is merely that of adding the doubled servants and
              the lock-out scene to the Menaechmi: A fairer
                statement would be that the two plots have been combined to the marked modification
                of both, and have also been very considerably amplified.

            Wislicenus
              was not regularly noticed until Gill (1930, p. 15) made such oversight unthinkable, unless
              one wished to deny the influence of Amphitruo; it had not yet
              been translated into English and hence presumably could not be read by a Sh. who
              supposedly could not read Latin. Courthope (1903, p. 79) thinks he is the first to name
                Amphitruo as a source. Duckworth (1952, pp. 412–13)
              believes that an English translation of Amphitruo was made in
              1562–3, but he is mistaken. He is followed by Riehle (1990, p. 36).

            How much or whether Alcmena influenced Sh.’s characterization of Adriana is lightly
              argued. Gill
              (1930, pp. 34 ff.) marks the parallels between the two without comment. Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, p. 211): Certainly Adriana is in no way
                imitated from Alcmena.
              Miola (1994,
              pp. 29–30): Amphitruo also supplies Shakespeare with
                Alcmena, pious [30] matrona, who
                elevates Adriana beyond the merely dull or shrewish stereotype. The rhetoric of
                accusation and protest between husband and wife in Amphitruo inspires several confrontations in Errors. He cites Gill (1930), who lists all the parallels between
                Err. and Amphitruo (numbers are to
              TLNs): 209–59, 263–8, 530, 608–10, 624–37, 629,
                729, 755–67, 1074–97, 1343–8, 1349–88, 1367–8, 1389, 1666–70, 1680–2, 1684–6, 1858–77.

            In considering the influence of other Plautine plays, Enk (1920, pp. 362–3) compares
                741 with Captivi 1002 (see n. 744)
              and, less certainly, foot-ball (359) with Captivi 368 pro rota me uti licet (You can use me like a hoop), where
                rota is usually translated wheel (tr. Nixon, 1917,
              1:497).

            Phialas
              (1966, pp. 7–9): In the Captivi the father’s name is
                Hegio, which Shakespeare could easily have turned to Egeon, although . . . the
                exact form of the name may have come from the legends of Theseus and his father
                Aegeus, King of Athens. He tells the Captivi story
              of a father losing two sons, one stolen, the other taken prisoner in war. After a
              long-delayed reconciliation comes a passage in which Hegio displays a (p. 8) clash of emotions . . . when it is revealed that one of the prisoners is
                his own long-lost son. The passage . . . is one that would have appealed strongly
                to Shakespeare. . . . 

            
              Another feature of the Captivi which would
                have impressed a young dramatist is the play’s structure, which Lessing called the
                best in existence. . . . 
            

            [9] In the Captivi
                Shakespeare would have found much to interest him, especially the accommodation of
                sentiment as well as conflict and powerful emotion in a comic
                structure. . . . Although it is true that family reunion and reconciliation is very
                common in the prose romances . . . , [it] is certainly a major element of the
                  Captivi.

            Arthos (1971,
              pp. 151 ff.) adds Plautus’s Rudens in the process of showing
              that Sh. did more than merely multiply the incidents of the Menaechmi: He let us know that some power was at work in
                these misadventures and in their very multiplicity, or at least that there were
                grounds for supposing so; and the audience, so differently from that attending to
                Plautus, is being brought to think of all this as somehow the demonstration of
                mysterious influences making use of the confusion, turning it all to
                good. . . . 

            [154] Plautus himself had an uncommonly fine
                sense of the tenderness as well as the strength of human love, and I think he gave
                Shakespeare the lead he wanted on this very matter although he himself could not
                have conceived of the happiness Shakespeare took into view. The hint for bringing
                this unearthly loveliness into this high-spirited comedy came from another of
                Plautus’s, the Rudens. Here there is a scene like that with
                which The Tempest was to begin, where two men from the
                shore are watching a storm tear a ship to pieces. They see survivors, two women,
                cast loose on a raft, and as it turns out these are being saved for a glorious
                fate.

            Riehle (1990)
              devotes his book to demonstrating (p. 3) that Shakespeare . . . made a close
                study of the classical tradition at the beginning of his career, especially
              an exhaustive study of all Plautus’s plays. He strongly denies Baldwin’s emphasis on Terence as
              an influence, and in this respect Riehle needs studying to help students balance the
              massive scholarship and emphatic certainty of Baldwin. But in his way Riehle is as
              certain as Baldwin that he can trace to Plautus the sources for major and minor
              aspects of Err. He credits Sh. with a level of classical
              attainments that is not credible, as for example when he derives Erotes and Errotis
              from the Greek (p. 178) ἐρωτάω
                to ask,
                to try to find out. The proper form of the name would then be
                  Erotetes, but the contraction may be explained as a case of
                haplology. . . . This cognomen has to be seen in the light of other Shakespearean
                names of Greek [179] origin, such as, for example, Ophelia
                and Sycorax. In any case, it is an astonishing instance of Shakespeare’s
                erudition. (Baldwin [1947, p. 697] makes the same claim for to
                ask, only to abandon it.) Excesses such as this and others, equally
              implausible, about the names are compensated for by careful, detailed readings of
              Plautus and Err. where it is often likely that Sh. responded
              to patterns of theme and structure that a sensitive playwright might absorb.

            Miola (1994,
              pp. 18, 22): Like Plautus and Terence themselves, Shakespeare continually
                reformulates and interrogates his New Comedic heritage. . . . Throughout his works
                Shakespeare creatively adapts New Comedic dramaturgy. . . . Dramatic devices like
                the lock-out, disguise, and eavesdropping appear in strange translations as do
                familiar New Comedic configurations: the blocking father, his daughter, her lover;
                the clever slave and master; the importunate lover and worldly courtesan; the
                reunion of parent and child. As always, classical elements, present in different
                degrees in different plays, combine with non-classical ones—the Bible, medieval
                literature, the Italian novella, contemporary fiction and drama—not in static
                co-existence but dynamic interaction.

            Instead of Gill’s double columns comparing Menaechmi and
                Err., Miola shows Sh. ranging over the plot and character
              elements of Plautus and Terence generally, using them in whatever new combinations he
              needs; Sh. has been saturated with New Comedy, not just two plays. (P. 22):
                Although no one would deny Shakespeare’s general indebtedness to Plautus in
                this play, the specific tally of debits and credits has occasioned some dispute.
                Because the two Dromios . . . sport Italian names . . . some have thought them
                Italianate rather than Plautine. But not every classical slave is callidus; many, including Messenio of Menæchmi and
                Sosia of Amphitruo, are humorous victims of abuse and
                misunderstanding. Moreover, the two Dromios continually replay jokes and routines
                from New Comedy, such as complaining about obeying orders, yearning for
              freedom, running breathless onstage, using the rope as a stage prop after the
              convention of calling people mastigia (one who deserves a whipping),
              and so on, elements taken from other plays than Menaechmi.
              His chapter complements Gill, making it even clearer that Sh. could not have been
              solely dependent on Warner’s translation to produce Err.

            Rudd (1994)
              attractively compares the Plautus plays and Err., as well as
              remarking on how Sh. adapted the romance and Plautine traditions. Though he covers
              familiar ground, the essay is worth reading.

            Sh. does differ from Plautus in some ways. Most commentators approve of Err.’s high moral tone, though few remark on the actual beatings
              the Dromios suffer as opposed to Messenio’s lack of them, but some other differences
              are noted.

            Swinburne
              (1875, pp. 631–2): [He] embroidered on the naked old canvass of comic action
                those [632] flowers of elegiac beauty which vivify and
                diversify the scene of Plautus as reproduced by the art of Shakespeare. . . . The
                sweetness and simplicity of lyric or elegiac loveliness which fill and inform the
                scenes, when Adriana, her sister, and the Syracusan Antipholus exchange the
                expression of their errors and their loves, belong to Shakespeare alone.
              Brink (1895,
              p. 180): The repulsive moral relations disclosed to us by Plautus’ Menæchmi
                were modified by Shakespeare with a delicate touch.
              Kittredge (ed.
              1936, p. 133): In thus raising the tone of the play above that of the Menaechmi [by adding the frame story and the wooing of Luciana],
                Shakespeare was influenced by the Amphitruo, which is
                really a tragicomedy. Thus the Amphitruo, besides
                contributing to the plot, exercised a pervasively dignifying effect, even in those
                scenes which are original.

            Craig (1948,
              pp. 23–5): E. Antipholus is far better than [his] prototype [depicted
                as lewd and dishonest], but . . . has the markings of that
                prototype. . . . Plautus’s discrimination between the masters is much less emphatic
                than that of Shakespeare. . . . Nowhere is there any motive but simple selfishness,
                and both the Menaechmi are ordinary, rather shifty Greeks of the merchant [24] class. . . . 

            [25] Amphitruo is a
                rougher, more brutal, and more brilliant comedy than Menaechmi. One cannot see, however, that The Comedy of
                  Errors was affected in any way by the tone of Amphitruo except perhaps in the vulgar description which Dromio of
                Syracuse gives his master of Nell (or Luce) in 3.2.

            Highet (1949,
              p. 215): The Comedy of Errors is more of a drama than
                most of Plautus’ comedies: more carefully wrought, more finely characterized, more
                various, less funny but more moving, and, despite its naughtiness, nobler in moral
                tone. He goes on to comment on the limitations of his [Sh.’s]
                classical knowledge. . . . Anyone who can read his [Plautus’s] language fluently is
                bound to be infected by the rattling gaiety of his words. Shakespeare (who could not
                even get the name of Epidamnus right) failed . . . to take over Plautus’ verbal
                skill, although he mastered his plotting and surpassed his
              characterization.

            Although Doran (1954) has only a few scattered sentences on Err. (slightly marred by two references to Egeon as Aegeus), her chapter
                Comedy illuminates how Err. is in
              the English tradition of adapting New Comedy.

            Arthos (1971,
              p. 154), on S. Antipholus’s falling in love with Luciana, and especially 834–8:
                At this very point, Shakespeare is also going beyond Plautus in a matter of
                equally great importance to his entire undertaking.

            Idem (1972,
              pp. 22 ff.) shows at much greater length than in his earlier article how Plautus
              influenced the romantic tone of Err. and not just the
              farcical spine of the action. His chapter is as much about Plautus as Sh., but as with
                Gill (1930)
              above, he emphasizes the Latin Plautus, since he says that Sh. could have had no
              recourse to all the plays in translation. (P. 22): In the Menaechmi, in the jockeying with dreams and madness, there is nothing of
                the poignancy of the thought of real madness that hovers over the confusions of
                  Amphitryon and especially over the servant Sosia in that
                play . . . ; nor . . . is there anything like the sense of pain we share with
                Hegio in The Captives, who believes a servant has destroyed
                his last hope of retrieving a son. Nor as in The Shipwreck
                is there the pathos and loneliness of a youth whose betrothed has been stolen from
                him, although Menaechmus of Syracuse is in bad straits. The hints of such feelings
                in the Menaechmi may have been enough for Shakespeare for
                the emphasis he required in The Comedy of Errors, or the
                  Amphitryon may have given him the lead, but, however that
                may be, for Plautus as for Shakespeare comedy such as theirs would always entertain
                sharp distress and pathos in the midst of the fun. He reneges a bit about
              the Rudens (see above) (p. 38): I do not know that
                Shakespeare read [Rudens], but something of this same
                romantic character belongs to Plautus almost everywhere, although there is only a
                hint of it in the Menaechmi, notably in the brief comment
                on the father in the Prologue—[quotes 160–1]—whether this was the hint that Shakespeare
                took, or whether it was the beauty of the wonderful in the Amphitryon, or still something else, it is precisely the incident about
                the father’s arrival in Ephesus that provided Shakespeare with the play’s initiating
                circumstance and that gives it its initially romantic cast. . . . 

            Muir (1972,
              p. 47): Despite Shakespeare’s indebtedness to Plautus, the spirit of his play
                is very different from his originals. He is more ingenious, much more complex, and
                funnier; but he is also more didactic. It would tax the ingenuity of commentators to
                extract a good lesson from either of the two Plautine plays, but Shakespeare has no
                difficulty in extracting two interrelated lessons from his material—the damage done
                to marriage by infidelity and jealousy.

            Colman (1974,
              p. 25): Sh. shows a tendency to eliminate potential salacity in
              cleaning up the Courtesan’s role and averting the intercourse of Amphitruo.

            O’Brien
              (1996, §§10–11) shows how much more seriously Sh. treats S. Antipholus’s fear that he
              is going mad than Plautus does with the visiting Menaechmus, who only pretends
              insanity.

            Others who comment on Err.’s improved morals compared with
              those in Plautus are Dowden (1877; 1882, pp. 66–7): E. Antipholus is not base and vicious
              like the repulsive Menæchmus; Matthews (1913, p. 71): Shakspere cleanses
                away most of the vulgarity flagrant in Plautus and perhaps to be explained by the
                fact that [Plautus] wrote his pieces to be performed by slaves before an audience of
                ignorant freedmen who had to be amused at all costs; and Biswas (1971),
              who makes general remarks on how Sh. improves the moral of Menaechmi and Amphitruo.

          





          
            Structure, Themes, Characterization

            For Schlegel
              (1809–11, tr. 1815, 2:158): Perhaps [Err. is] the best
                of all written or possible Menæchmi, see .

            Lloyd (in
                Singer, ed.
              1856, 2:82): In a play where fine characterization is inappropriate . . . if
                not impossible, . . . the poet who chooses a theme of restricted capability, is at
                least bound to avail himself to the utmost of what capability it has; that this was
                not done by Plautus, is proved by the comedy of Shakespeare which complicates the
                source of embarrassment, —the personal resemblance of two masters, by the addition
                of a pair of servants equally indistinguishable.

            Klingelhöffer
              (1873, pp. 20 ff.) finds the anachronism of putting an abbess in a carefully set-up
              pre-Christian world (p. 23) bizarre. (P. 29) He calls Menaechmi and Err. comedies of chance where there
              is no question of there being a principal personage around whom all others revolve and
              whose character is the end and source of the action. (P. 30) Sh., having doubled the
              twins, is superior to Plautus, if the art of the dramatist consists of being able to
              multiply the opportunities for errors. He refers to Friedrich Bodenstedt, who
              regretted that Sh. had not provided twins for Adriana and Luciana on the grounds that
              any playwright who could manage four twins would not be embarrassed with six (n’aurait pas été embarrassé de s’arranger avec six). But since
                Err. is not a comedy of character, Sh.’s superiority over
              Plautus is one of a superiority of execution in the details, not a superiority of
              kind.

            Porter &amp;
                  Clarke (ed. 1903, p. xxiv): The dry little
                argument preceding Plautus’s play, in which the bare facts leading to the subsequent
                action are set forth, and in which the one pathetic touch is the father’s death
                because of the loss of his child, has been developed in the story of Ægeon into a
                serious and wonderfully pathetic background.

            Rouse (1912, pp. xiii f.) counts up the mistaken meetings in Plautus
              and Err.: Menæchmus the Citizen does not meet any
                strangers until the last scene, when he is confronted with his double. Menæchmus the
                Traveller has seven such meetings (counting each of the important characters as
                one); the Wife, the Father, and Messenio have two each; Peniculus, Erotium,
                Cylindrus, and the maid one each. On the other hand: in Shakespeare Antipholus the
                Citizen has [xiv] three such meetings, Antipholus the
                Traveller twelve; Dromio the Citizen’s man has four, and the other Dromio eleven
                (counting the house scene as one [of the eleven]); Adriana . . . has seven; her
                sister . . . eight; the Courtezan four; and Luce one. The proportion of Shakespeare
                to Plautus is 50:17, or nearly three to one. This was made possible by the invention
                of the second Dromio.

            Gill (1924,
              pp. 80 ff.) compares the characters in Menaechmi and Err., though her discussion usually does little more than describe
              incidents common to the two plays. After three tables, Characters Common to
                Both Plays,
              Shakespeare’s Additions, and In the Menaechmi, Omitted by Shakespeare, she covers each person
              named.

            (P. 80): There are sixteen characters (besides the gaoler, officer, etc.) in
                Shakespeare’s play in contrast to the ten in the play of Plautus. Of the Shakespeare
                additions, Dromio of Ephesus is chief in importance, and Luciana is next. Then comes
                the enveloping-action group, the Duke, Aegeon, and Aemilia, while as minor
                characters the merchants aid the complicating situations, and Luce adds somewhat to
                the fun.

            She thinks that Luciana partly fulfills the function of the father in the Menaechmi in that (p. 92) the old man champions the
                husband’s liberty, chides the wife for her jealous nagging, but is fair enough to
                see that the husband also is to blame in 5.2.785–805.

            Summarizing, she says (p. 93): 1. Shakespeare has added to his
                characters traits which are lacking in those of Plautus, and thus he makes them more
                complex and more human; as, for example, to Antipholus of Syracuse he has given
                morality, honesty, and sentiment, and in Adriana he has added to the jealousy and
                temper of the wife womanly qualities of which there is no suggestion in
                [Plautus].

            
              2. He has used one character as a foil for another: he contrasts
                Adriana and Luciana, Antipholus of Ephesus and Antipholus of Syracuse, and to a less
                degree, the two Dromios.
            

            
              3. He has seized upon some of the most human traits in the characters
                of Plautus—sometimes little more than suggested—and intensified them, such as the
                serious-mindedness and the melancholy of the twin who seeks his brother; the charm
                and ability of the married brother, as evidenced by his popularity and his business
                reputation; and the affection of slave for master.
            

            [94] 4. He has transferred actions from one
                character to another for the sake of consistency in character or for dramatic
                effect; for example, he transfers to the rash married brother the violence of the
                more serious brother in the Latin play when he is accused of madness. The most
                notable instance of this transference is that of the reprimand and philosophy of the
                father to the two women, the young Luciana and the older, more experienced
                mother. All these similarities and differences, it may be remarked, Sh.
              could have made if he had Warner’s 1595 translation to work with, a point Gill does not
              consider.

            Charlton
              (1931: 1938, pp. 47, 64–5): Sh. turned to Plautus to get away from the romantic
              formlessness of LLL: He submitted himself to a
                discipline which, however uncongenial to the spirit, was a salutary apprenticeship
                to the mechanics of play-building. He constructs a typical Roman play,
              features of which Sh. adapted.

            (P. 64): Yet . . . transplanting stories to other societies in other and
                later periods of time is bound to sever them from that which gives them their
                essential significance. . . . In particular there are these all-important
                men-servants. The English bourgeoisie of the sixteenth century had no exact
                counterpart of them in their households. Hence the Dromios are exotic on the English
                stage. In England, menial servants who are soundly kicked at frequent intervals are
                hardly likely to be taken into the confidential personal secrets of the
                  masters. . . . [65] In their new surroundings on an
                English stage, circumstance scarcely ever allows them to be the engineers of the
                story as Roman slaves are. Almost invariably, they are merely its
                clowns.
              Charlton turns
              his essay into character studies of the principals and lists the changes that Sh.
              made: inventing the jailor-constable and Pinch, omitting the parasite, making Adriana
              more appealing than Plautus’s shrewish wife.

            Kittredge (ed.
              1936, p. 134), accounting for the metrical variety of Err.—blank verse, decasyllabic verses rhyming alternately, doggerel:
                This variety, which has sometimes been taken as evidence that [Err.] is an old play worked over, rather indicates Shakespeare’s
                wish to imitate the variety that he found in Plautus. The form used by him always
                fits the mood, the speaker, and the situation.

            Craig (1948,
              pp. 22, 26): The genius of Plautus manifests itself splendidly in the fifth
                act, which is masterly. It contains a long and extremely amusing scene between
                Menaechmus the Traveler and his brother’s wife, Mulier [woman; her
                proper name is never disclosed], which is heightened by an interview with Senex [old
                man], her father, and further heightened by a side-splitting examination of the
                angry Citizen by Medicus [doctor] in order to determine his sanity. It is much
                better than the encounter with Dr. Pinch . . . for Shakespeare’s play misses the
                humor of the situation. It is the Traveler who in Plautus was suspected of insanity,
                who actually counterfeited insanity, and it is the Citizen who undergoes the
                examination.

            (P. 26): Err.
              is clear and easy to follow just as drama, without the aid of long explanatory
                speeches such as Plautus usually employs in order to make his action
              clear.

            Foakes (ed.
              1962, pp. xxv f.): Shakespeare not only multiplied the twins and the
                possibilities of error . . . by creating the Dromios, he also altered the emphasis
                of the Plautine plot. In The Comedy of Errors the Courtesan
                loses prominence and has no name, while the wife not only gains in stature and
                acquires a name, Adriana, but has, too, a confidante in her sister Luciana. The
                parasite and the wife’s father vanish altogether, while the courtesan’s maid and
                cook are transferred to the wife, and changed into Luce, Adriana’s servant, and
                Nell, the unseen kitchen-wench. . . . In Menaechmi, thanks to the long interchange in Act I between Menaechmus of
                Epidamnum (who corresponds to Antipholus of Ephesus) and the parasite (who was cut
                out altogether by Shakespeare), and the sequence between him and his father-in-law
                at the end, of which only fragments are retained in The Comedy of
                  Errors, this Menaechmus is the centre of dramatic interest. Considerably
                more prominence was given by Shakespeare to the other twin, and Antipholus of
                Syracuse has nearly a hundred lines more than his brother, as well as a more
                sympathetic rôle, which includes the wooing of Luciana. In addition, the characters
                of Shakespeare’s play are given more humanity, and more distinctiveness, as even the
                rather flat Medicus of Plautus is transformed into the egregious Doctor
                Pinch. . . . 

            [xxvi] The most direct link between The Comedy of Errors and Menaechmi is
                the use of the terms Surreptus (Sereptus) and Errotis (Erotes) to describe
                respectively Antipholus of Ephesus and his twin of Syracuse.

            Barber (1964,
              pp. 494–7): Even in farce, something must be going on already—Antipholus of
                Ephesus late for dinner again, his wife in her usual rage. . . . He [Sh.] also
                creates a prosperous commercial town outside the domestic world of the jealous
                wife’s household: its merchant-citizens are going about their individual business,
                well known to one another and comfortably combining business with pleasure—until the
                errors catch up with them. Much the same can be said of Menaechmi save that Sh. has more characters.

            Then, talking about the treatment of the wives, Barber says Plautus is
              unambiguous as to whether she has been and is being misused (p. 495): The difference reflects the difference in the two cultures, Roman and Elizabethan.
                It also reflects the different form of comedy which Shakespeare was beginning to
                work out, a comedy appropriate to the fullest potentialities of his culture. Roman
                comedy functioned as a special field-day for outrageousness; by and large, it fitted
                Aristotle’s formula that comedy deals with characters who are worse than we
                are. . . . Most of the stage people are meant to be fractions of human nature on
                its aggressive, libidinal side. . . . [Sh.’s] characters . . . are presented as
                total, not fractional: whatever their faults, they are conceived as whole people.
                His comedy dramatizes outrageousness, but usually it is presented as the product of
                special circumstances, or at least it is [496] abetted by
                circumstances. . . . 

            [497] Shakespeare’s sense of comedy as a
                moment in a larger cycle leads him to go out of the way . . . to frame farce with
                action which presents the weight of age and the threat of death, and to make the
                comic resolution a renewal of life.

            
            Hamilton
              (1967, pp. 91–5, 101–3): An emphasis upon plot may seem inevitable in
                a play that derives from both Plautus’ boisterous intrigue and Terence’s complicated
                action, especially for an Elizabethan dramatist with his love of variety in action.
                Yet the decision to imitate the Menaechmi involves
                Shakespeare in a problem of structure. Plautus’ plot is episodic, or, in Aristotle’s
                terms, simple rather than complex (Poetics 1452a12), and superficial in the sense of lying upon the
                narrative level in the repetition of episodes involving mistaken identity. An error
                results from a previous error, and each follows the other mechanically until, after
                all possibilities have been exhausted, the brothers are brought together upon the
                  stage. . . . [92] Lacking any logic of its own, the play
                substitutes for a plot the mathematical possibilities of error inherent in the comic
                situation of a twin’s being mistaken for his identical brother. . . . 

            
              In avoiding this danger, his play illustrates Aristotle’s rules that
                the change of fortune that resolves the action—here the meeting of the two
                brothers—should involve recognition combined with peripety, and that both should
                result from the construction of the plot (Poetics 1452a14–20). Consequently, the plot expresses his idea of
                comedy and becomes the soul of a play he ambitiously terms THE Comedy of Errors.
            

            
              Shakespeare shapes his entire comedy most obviously through the device
                of Egeon’s tragic story, which serves as both the point of departure and the
                resolution of the comedy of errors. . . . [93] Egeon’s story
                becomes the prologue or argument to the comedy of errors in the sense that the
                comedy will reverse his tragic fall. . . . 
            

            
              Plautus is significant in showing Shakespeare what to avoid. In place
                of a mechanical repetition of mistaken identity . . . Shakespeare seeks dramatic
                complexity. A comparison of the episodes where the wife meets her husband
                illustrates this point. In Plautus, the comic situation presents a simple domestic
                quarrel: through Peniculus’ spite, an angry [94] wife accuses
                an embarrassed and blustering husband of stealing her cloak. She rages, he lies, and
                the Parasite enjoys his revenge. . . . When Shakespeare imitates this episode, he
                offers, in place of a comedy of situation, a complex drama of human confusion in
                which the wife sees her husband and servant conspiring against her, the husband sees
                his wife and servant conspiring against him, and the servant remains confounded
                between them. Each speaks the truth, yet appears to lie, and the episode ends in
                bafflement, rage, and growing madness. . . . 
            

            [95] To have error culminate in madness is one
                means by which Shakespeare imposes form upon the comic device of mistaken identity.
                Taking the hint from Plautus, where both brothers are accused of being mad, he
                applies it directly to Antipholus of Ephesus.
              Hamilton
              concentrates on madness, E. Antipholus’s angry responses, S. Antipholus’s welcoming
              ones, and on Plato’s two kinds of madness, Ovidian and transformational.

            (P. 101): Wonder increases until by the end it can transform the
                tragedy that began the comedy of errors.

            
              Shakespeare constructs his play in order to achieve as great a
                reversal of intention as possible. Aristotle illustrates peripety from a play about
                  Lynceus. . . . (Poetics 1452a27–29). In Shakespeare’s play Ege­[102]on, too,
                is saved at the last moment. . . . 
            

            [103] Yet we know that the meeting results
                from no accident [referring to 1836–7]: the resolution does not come about until the
                comedy of errors reaches a climactic moment that can dissolve the
              tragedy.
            

            Arthos (1971,
              p. 154): This story and its beauty had their origin in a Greek romance where a
                mother and a small daughter are cast afloat in a chest. They become separated after
                the rescue, the mother to devote her lonely life as a priestess to Diana, but at the
                end husband and daughter are restored to her. So, in The Comedy of
                  Errors, a hint from the Rudens, more than that
                from ancient romances . . . still another spirit from the ancient world is
                contributing beauty and poignancy to Shakespeare’s comedy, enrichening that central
                affirmation at the heart of his idea of human character, the idea of the soul’s
                truth.

            Leggatt
              (1974, pp. 1–3): Plautus is more rational than Sh. in accounting for, e.g., how the
              cook knows the visiting Menaechmus’s name (see above, ), namely that courtesans send spies to learn the names of
              passengers on in-coming ships and feign acquaintanceship of them, whereas Sh. (p.3)
                takes fewer pains . . . to give a logical underpropping to his comic
                fantasy. There is nothing improbable in identical twins, but identical twins with
                the same name takes some explaining, and Plautus is ready with the answer:
                  When it was tolde us that you and our father were both dead, our Graundsire
                  (in memorie of my fathers name) chaunged mine to Menechmus ([see ]).
                Shakespeare provides two sets of twins with the same name,
                and not a word of explanation.

            Long (1976)
              investigates (p. 20) the logical distinction between errors of cognition and
                errors of association. In all comedies which revolve around Doppelgänger,
                individuals either may be mistaken about the identity of a character or may
                incorrectly attribute actions to a character whom they correctly
              identify.

            He goes through Menaechmi and Err.
              on what the effect of doubling twins is, including Rouse’s The proportion of
                Shakespeare to Plautus is 50:17 or nearly three to one (p. 22): This
                is true theoretically, but in one sense irrelevant. Though we might expect
                Shakespeare to increase the number of misidentifications, in fact, he uses the new
                set of twins in order to radiate confusions of attribution. Arithmetically, one
                might observe that Shakespeare is less efficient than Plautus . . . [who] almost
                doubles the possibilities of confusion inherent in his material, whereas Shakespeare
                adds only two more scenes to the number which the original possibilities
                suggest.

            Muir (1979,
              p. 16): A mere translation, however, would not do, if only because of its
                shortness and because of the alien morals and manners of the Plautine world. It is
                notable, for example, that the courtesan has a more important role in the Menaechmi than in [Err.]. In spite of
                Renaissance assumptions about the moral function of comedy . . . there is not the
                faintest sign that Plautus disapproved of his hero’s conduct.

            
            Shaw (1980,
              pp. 18–21): For it is upon such knowledge [of Sh.’s narrative sources for
                  Err.] that we can base our assessment of the freedom with
                which Shakespeare adapted and added and also come to recognize when he broke with
                direct or indirect Plautine influence to adopt other dramatic methods and style,
                particularly those of Terence, whose plays contain fully developed double
              plots. I would like to suggest that Shakespeare, whose knowledge of Plautus and
                Terence was as great as theirs had been of Menander and Apollodorus, took the same
                liberties with Plautine narrative and with Terence’s interlocking double plots as
                Terence had done with his Greek forebears and that this freedom opened the way for
                an even greater expansion of that comic complication and character
                illumination of which [Richard] Levin speaks [The Multiple Plot in
                  English Renaissance Drama]. The result is that in Shakespeare’s play there
                are not two, but three levels of dramatic sensibility, each
                projecting a different tone.

            She says that in drawing the two Dromios from Amphitruo, Sh.
              practiced Terentian contaminatio, and
              in addition, he practiced (p. 20) extracontamination, adding characters
              and situations from nondramatic sources (Egeon and the Abbess) and (p. 21)
                  auto-contamination, the addition of a character of his own
                invention, Luciana.
            

            For possible rhetorical devices common to Plautus, Terence, and Sh., see Newman (1985, pp.
              4 ff.), .

            Others who compare Plautus and Sh., usually finding Sh. an improvement, are Eckhardt (1902,
              p. 41): The cheerfulness of the Dromios links them to Messenio, but otherwise they are
              true English clowns. Anders (1904, pp. 32–3) notes some similarities in names and
              incidents in Menaechmi, Amphitruo,
              and Err. but thinks Sh. did not use Latin Plautus. Montégut (1906,
              1: 197): Sh. is superior in fertility of invention—variety of surprises, farcical
              complications, verve, and good humor. Gleichen-Russwurm (1909, pp. 26–7): In Plautus the wife
              has no name and the courtesan is Erotium, in Sh. it is just the reverse. Pettet (1949, pp.
              67–8): Like Titus Andronicus, The
                  Comedy of Errors belongs unmistakably to the drama of the previous
                generation, and because of this its [68] relationship to the
                rest of Shakespeare’s comedies is rather like that of Titus
                  Andronicus to the tragedies. Because it is so faithfully Plautine
                it is clearly distinguished from the majority of Shakespeare’s comedies, if
                not their antithesis as a type of drama.
              Kuckhoff
              (1964, p. 149): Sh. humanizes Plautus by turning one clever Messenio into two English,
              in fact London, servingmen, while Emilia’s lecture in 5.1 on getting along as man and
              wife is not too severe. Günther (1965, pp. 37–8) summarizes what Sh. took from the Plautus
              plays and what he added. Tillyard (1965, p. 49): Shakespeare did something which we
                need not connect with any precedent. He humanized his farcical nucleus and
                approximated it to comedy in a way Plautus never even began to do. First, he made
                his Ephesus a more living city than Plautus’s Epidamnus. Ephesus became a place
                where not only ridiculous things happened but where men encountered the perennial
                problem of how to live together in a society. Second, he defined and contrasted his
                persons in a way Plautus never tried to do.
              Soellner
              (1972, p. 68): It is interesting to note that this passionate outbreak [1327–97] of the
                Ephesian Menaechmus [sic: Antipholus] was Shakespeare’s revision. In Plautus, it is
                the stranger-Menaechmus who is characterized as a man of ungovernable
                temper . . . whereas the citizen-Menaechmus is and remains fairly even-tempered.
                When he plays the madman, he does so merely to frighten his wife. Others who
              likewise comment on Sh.’s superiority are Guizot (1821, 3:215), Claus (1861), Hugo (1864, pp.
              41, 44–5), Stapfer (1880, pp. 147–8), and Blume (1969, pp. 145–6).

            A few who comment without making invidious comparisons: Parrott (1949, pp. 103, 105):
                Of all the many adaptations of the Menaechmi, The Comedy of Errors is by far the freest and most
                original. . . . It is the best plotted of Shakespeare’s early comedies, due, no
                doubt, to the fact that he had the play of Plautus as a model and preserved the
                Plautine unities.
              Highet (1949,
              p. 214): Shakespeare did not merely lift the idea [of twin servants] from
                  Amphitryon and insert it en bloc into the other play, but blended the two plays in
                an organic fusion to make a new and richer drama.
              Duckworth
              (1952, p. 418) repeats Highet without attribution, adding The
                  Comedy of Errors is not a combination of scenes from two Plautine comedies
                but a completely new play, in which the classical material and the newer, more
                pathetic, elements have been blended to create an organic whole—an excellent fusion
                of romantic spirit and classical restraint in which pathos and farce exist side by
                side.

            
            Very occasionally Plautus is preferred. Lennox (1753, 2:238–9): The
                Mistakes which arise from the Resemblance of the Twins, are conducted with much less
                Art by Shakespear than Plautus.

            
              In the Latin Poet all appears the Effects of
                Chance, in Shakespear of Design; the Persons in his Drama are
                hardly ever introduced with Propriety; they appear on the Stage, and go off again,
                evidently for no other Purpose than to give Occasion for the Blunders which
                  ensue. . . . [239] Those Errors do not as in the play,
                which Shakespear borrowed from [Warner, which she has not
                seen, nor can she read Latin; she uses a French translation of Plautus], arise out
                of a natural and probable Succession of Incidents, but every Thing is put out of its
                course to introduce them, and each Error is produced by an Absurdity.
            

            Connely
              (1924, pp. 303–4) flatly prefers Plautus to Sh., calling the preference for Sh.
                blunders which depend on ignorance of Plautus and an apparent
                belief that Shakspere is omnipotent. Sh.’s defect is the doubling of the
              twins. It is well enough to insist that the more improbabilities the funnier
                the farce, but is the fun heightened by confusion of the audience? Why make a farce
                an extravaganza? Furthermore, Sh. adds six characters to Plautus’s ten, so
              that (p. 304) his minor characters have not enough to do to make them either
                indispensable or adequately amusing. Through the mouth of another character Luce is
                mildly funny as an amorous greasy Joan; through the mouth of another character Pinch
                is as graphic as the apothecary in Romeo and Juliet, and so on through the
              whole cast, all diluted in Sh., pungent and forceful in Plautus. Sh. was immature and
              improved immeasurably. Though Connely exaggerates, one might as well admit the justice
              of many of his points.

            Watt (1925,
              pp. 401–2) agrees with Connely, but objects that invidious comparisons either way are
              pointless, for the two plays were written under conditions entirely different
                and served audiences as remote as the poles. Connely does not sufficiently
              respond to the (p. 402) romantic spirit of Elizabethan comedy and the dramatic
                form which that spirit assumed. No comparison of the Latin and the Elizabethan play
                can be sound which is based on the assumption that Shakespeare tried on the whole to
                copy Plautus, and that he is weakest where he is least skillful as an
                imitator.

            Duckworth
              (1952, p. 418) admires Err., but the presence of two
                sets of twins . . . makes the play more confusing [than Menaechmi] and heightens the improbability of the situation, as was not
                the case in the Amphitruo, where the two pairs of doublets
                were created by divine fiat. The
                entrances and exits of Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse at times lack motivation
                and the conclusion of the comedy is complicated by an excessive number of
                recognitions. Plautus’ comedy has a unity and a compactness lacking in Shakespeare’s
                play; it is pure farce, while The Comedy of Errors has far
                greater variety and is thoroughly Elizabethan in its combination of farce, romance,
                and pathos.

            Taylor (1989,
              pp. 395 ff.), in a generally iconoclastic study, prefers Latin comedy, especially
              Plautus; he quotes recent criticism (e.g., Jorgensen, ed. 1964; Barton, in Evans, ed. 1974;
                Bevington,
              ed. 1988), remarking first that everyone takes Err. to be the
              first comedy, if not the first play, without sufficient evidence: Recent
                scholarship would place The Comedy of Errors somewhere
                toward the end of the first quarter of Shakespeare’s career—not, by a long shot, his
                earliest play or even his earliest comedy. But most of the critics I am about to
                quote consider it his first work, and yet they feel no compunction about repeatedly
                asserting that, in every sort of way, it surpasses a mature work of one of the two
                acknowledged masters of Roman comedy.

            Second, he objects to the notion that Sh. improves on Plautus by cleaning up the
              immorality. (P. 397): It is no doubt symptomatic of my own cynicism,
                amorality, and satirical hardness that this description [Bevington’s] of the superiority of
                Shakespeare’s play makes me want to read Plautus. I am reminded of Joe Orton’s wish
                that he should never write anything as bad as Shakespeare’s first
                plays. Are we to deduce from Bevington that courtesans are less legitimate as the
                subjects of great art than virtuous sisters? Must every comedy
                  enhance the love interest? The phrase [398]
                could have been excerpted from a movie magnate’s memo to a hack scriptwriter. Is it
                the business of a great artist to reshape his material in order to
                  reconcile it with the moral values of his time and
                place? . . . 

            [400] What I personally admire about
                Plautus . . . is what Shakespearians so regularly deprecate: hardness, toughness,
                exuberant and fantastic amorality. And what I dislike about Shakespeare’s
                comedies—and tragedies—is their softness, their central mushiness, their inevitable
                  love interest, their wholesomeness.

            
              In order to celebrate the gentle wholesomeness of Shakespeare, critics
                devalue the hard-core exuberance of Plautus. . . . [quotes Barton].
            

            [401] She diminishes the value of Plautus
                because he does nothing more than evoke a rather simple laughter.
                Presumably, therefore, great comedy does something more than make us

            Plautine comedy does no more than turn the normal world upside
                  down [Barton]. There is something almost immoral, something psy­[402]chologically unhealthy, about the whole idea of turning the
                world upside down. What is it, after all, but an indulgence in disruptive
                fantasy which he finds lacking in Sh.
            

          

        

      






      
        The Bible and the Liturgy

        Because Sh. seems to have had the letter to the Ephesians prominently in mind in writing
            Err., locating the play in Ephesus rather than in Plautus’s
          Epidamnus, this section looks at echoes and influences of the Epistle, other biblical
          references, and what critics have brought to bear from the Book of Common Prayer and the
          Book of Homilies in increasingly thematic interpretations. The biblical selections are
          from the Geneva Bible because of the general belief that it was what Sh. normally
          read.

        Passages referred to in the Commentary are preceded by bracketed TLNs. The following
          parallels have been found (numbers are Err. TLNs). Acts: 135–7, 583–7, 708–9, 1193–4, 1222–3, 1321–2, 1330–1, 1338–41, 1643–50. Ephesians: 281–99, 417–20, 934–5, 1196–7, 1327–9.

                  Peter was come to him self, he said, Now I know for a trueth, that the Lord hathe
                  sent his Angel, and hathe deliuered me out of the hand of Herode, and from all the
                  waiting for of the people of the Iewes.

                1 [tln
                  135–7] And it
                  came to passe, while Apollos was at Corinthus, that whẽ he passed through the
                  vpper coastes, came to Ephesus, and founde certeine disciples,

                2 And said vnto thẽ, Haue ye receiued the holie Gost sence ye beleued? And they
                  said vnto him, We haue not so muche as heard whether there be an holie Gost.

                3 And he said vnto them, Vnto what were ye then baptized? And they said, Vnto
                  Iohns baptisme.

                4 Then said Paul, Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme of repentance, saying
                  vnto the people, that they shulde beleue in him, which shulde come after him, that
                  is, in Christ Iesus.

                5 So when they heard it, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus.

                6 And Paul laid his hands vpon them, and the holie Gost came on them, &amp; they
                  spake the tongues, and prophecied.

                7 And all the men were about twelue.

                8 ¶ Moreouer he went into the Synagogue, &amp; spake boldely for the space of
                  thre moneths, disputing &amp; exhorting to the things that apperteine to the kingdome of God.

                
                9 [tln
                  1321–2, 1338–41] But when
                  certeine were hardened, and disobeyed, speaking euil of the way of God before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the
                  disciples, and disputed daily in the schole of one Tyrannus.

                10 And this was done by the space of two yeres, so that all
                  they which dwelt in Asia, heard the worde of the Lord Iesus, bothe Iews and
                  Grecians.

                11 And God wroght no smale miracles by the hands of Paul,

                12 So that from his bodie were broght vnto the sicke, kerchefs or handkerchefs,
                  and the diseases departed from them, and the euil spirits went out of them.

                
                13 [tln
                  583–7, 708–9, 1193–4, 1330–1, 1338–41, 1643–50, for vv.
                  13–19] Then certeine of the vagabonde Iewes, exorcistes, toke in hand to name ouer
                  thẽ which had euil spirits, the Name of the Lord Iesus, saying, We adiure you by
                  Iesus, whome Paul preacheth.

                14 (And there were certeine sonnes of Sceua a Iewe, the Priest, about seuen which did this)

                15 And the euil spirit answered, and said, Iesus I acknowledge, and Paul I knowe:
                  but who are ye?

                16 And the man in whome ye euil spirit was, ran on
                  them, &amp; ouercame them, &amp; preuailed against them, so that they fled out of
                  that house, naked, and wounded.

                17 And this was knowen to all the Iewes &amp; Grecians also, which dwelt at
                  Ephesus, &amp; feare came on them all, and the Name of the Lord Iesus was
                  magnified.

                18 And many that beleued, came and cõfessed, and shewed their workes.

                19 Many also of them, which vsed curious artes, broght their
                  bokes, and burned them before all men, and they counted the price of them, &amp;
                  founde it fiftie thousand pieces of siluer.
                
                

                20 So the worde of God grewe mightely, and preuailed.

                21 ¶ Now when these things were accomplished, Paul purposed by the Spirit to
                  passe through Macedonia and Achaia, and to go to Ierusalem, saying, After I haue
                  bene there, I must also se Rome.

                22 So sent he into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto him, Timotheus and
                  Erastus, but he remained in Asia for a season.

                23 And the same time there arose no smale trouble about that way.

                24 For a certeine man named Demetrius a siluersmith, which made siluer temples of
                  Diana, broght great gaines vnto the craftes men:

                25 Whome he called together, with the workemen of like things, and said, Sirs, ye
                  knowe that by this crafte we haue our goods.

                26 Moreouer ye se and heare, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost through out
                  all Asia this Paul hathe persuaded, &amp; turned away muche people, saying, That
                  they be not gods which are made with hands,

                27 So that not onely this thing is dangerous vnto vs, that the state shulde be
                  reproued, but also that the temple of the great goddesse Diana shulde be nothing
                  estemed, and that it wolde come to passe that her magnificence, which all Asia and
                  the worlde worshippeth, shulde be destroyed.

                28 Now when they heard it, they were ful of wrath, and cryed out, saying, Great
                    is Diana of the Ephesians.

                29 And the whole citie was ful of cõfusion, and they rushed into the commune
                  place with one assent, and caught Gaius, and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, &amp;
                  Pauls companions of his iourney.

                30 And whẽ Paul wolde haue entred in vnto the people, the disciples suffred him
                  not.

                31 Certeine also of the chief of Asia which were his friẽds, sent vnto him,
                  desirĩg him that he wolde not present him self in the commune place.

                32 Some therefore cryed one thing, and some another: for the assemblie was out of
                  order, and the more parte knewe not wherefore they were come together.

                33 And some of the companie drewe forthe Alexander, the
                  Iewes thrusting him forwardes. Alexander then beckened with the hand, and wolde
                  haue excused the matter to the people.

                34 But when they knewe that he was a Iewe, there arose a shoute almoste for the
                  space of two houres, of all men crying, Great is Diana of
                  the Ephesians.

                35 Then the towne clarke when he had stayed the people, said, Ye mẽ of Ephesus,
                  what man is it that knoweth not how that the citie of the Ephesians is a
                  worshipper of the great goddesse Diana, and of the image,
                  which came downe from Iupiter?

                36 Seing then that no man can speake against these things, ye oght to be
                  appeased, and to do nothing rashly.

                37 For ye haue broght hither these men, which haue neither commit sacrilege,
                  nether do blaspheme your goddesse.

                38 Wherefore, if Demetrius and the craftes men which are with him, haue a matter
                  against any mã, the lawe is open, &amp; there are Deputies: let them accuse one
                  another.

                39 But if ye inquire anie thing concerning other matters it maye be determined in
                  a lawful assemblie.

                40 For we are euen in ieopardie to be accused of this daies sedicion, forasmuche
                  as there is no cause, whereby we may giue a reason of this concourse of
                  people.

                41 And when he had thus spoken, he let the assemblie departe.

                CHAP. I.

                1 Paul an Apostle of Iesus Christ, by ye wil of God,
                  to the Saintes, which are at Ephesus, &amp; to the faithful in Christ Iesus:

                2 Grace be with you, &amp; peace frõ God our Father, &amp;
                    from the Lord Iesus Christ.

                3 Blessed be God euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,
                  which hathe blessed vs with all spiritual blessing in heauenlie things in
                  Christ.

                4 As he hathe chosen vs in him, before ye fundacion
                  of the worlde, yt we shulde be holie, &amp; without
                  blame before hĩ in loue:

                5 Who hathe predestinate vs, to be adopted through Iesus Christ vnto himself,
                  according to the good pleasure of his wil,

                6 To the praise of the glorie of his grace, wherewith he hathe made vs accepted
                  in his beloued.

                7 By whome we haue redemption through his blood, euen the
                  forgiuenes of sinnes, according to his riche grace:

                8 Whereby he hathe bene abũdant toward vs in all wisdome and vnderstanding,

                9 And hathe opened vnto vs the mysterie of his wil according to his good
                  pleasure, which he had purposed in him,

                10 That in the dispensacion of the fulnes of the times he might gather together
                  in one all things, bothe which are in heauẽ and which are in earth, euen in Christ:

                11 In whome also we are chosen when we were predestinate according to the purpose
                  of him, which worketh all things after the counsel of his owne wil,

                12 That we, which first trusted in Christ, shulde be vnto the praise of his
                  glorie:

                13 In whome also ye haue trusted after that ye heard the
                  worde of trueth, euen ye Gospel
                  of your saluacion, wherein also after that ye beleued, ye were sealed with the
                  holie Spirit of promes,

                14 Which is the ernest of our inheritance, vntil the redẽption of the possession
                  purchassed vnto the praise of his glorie.

                15 Therefore also after that I heard of the faith, which ye haue in the Lord
                  Iesus, &amp; loue towarde all the Saintes,

                16 I cease not to giue thankes for you, making mention of you in my prayers,

                17 That the God of our Lord Iesus Christ the Father of glorie, might giue vnto
                  you the Spirit of wisdome, and reuelation through the knowledge of him,

                18 That ye eyes of your vnderstanding may be
                  lightened that ye may knowe what the hope is of his calling, and what the riches
                  of his glorious inheritance is in the Saintes,

                19 And what is ye exceading greatnes of his power
                  toward vs, which beleue, according to the working of his mightie power,

                20 Which he wroght in Christ, whẽ he raised him from the dead, and set him at his
                  right hand in the heauenlie places,

                21 Farre aboue all principalitie, and power, &amp; might, &amp; domination, &amp;
                  euerie Name, that is named, not in this worlde onely, but also in that that is to
                  come,

                22 And hathe made all things subiect vnder his fete, &amp; hathe appointed him
                  ouer all things to be the head to the Church,

                23 Which is his bodie, euen the fulnes of him that filleth
                  all in all things.

              


              
                CHAP. II.

                1 And you hathe he quickened, that were dead in trespasses
                  and sinnes,

                2 Wherein, in time past ye walked, according to the course of this worlde, &amp;
                  after the prince that ruleth in the aire, euen the spirit,
                  that now worketh in the childrẽ of disobedience,

                3 Among whome we also had our cõuersation in time past, in the lustes of our
                  flesh, in fulfilling the wil of the flesh, &amp; of the minde, and were by nature
                  the children of wrath, as wel as others.

                4 But God which is riche ĩ mercie, through his great loue wherewith he loued
                  vs,

                5 Euen when we were dead by sinnes, hathe quickened vs together in Christ, by whose grace ye are saued,

                6 And hathe raised vs vp together, and made vs fit together in the heauenlie places in Christ Iesus,

                7 That he might shew in the ages to come the exceding riches of his grace,
                  through his kindnes towarde vs in Christ Iesus.

                8 For by grace are ye saued through faith, and that not of your selues: it is the gifte of God,

                9 Not of workes, lest any man shulde boaste him self.

                10 For we are his workemanship created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which
                  God hathe ordeined, that we shulde walke in them.

                11 Wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, &amp;
                  called vncircumcision of them, which are called circumcision in the flesh, made
                  with hands,

                12 That ye were, I say at yt
                  time without Christ, &amp; were aliantes from the cõmune welth of Israel, &amp;
                  were strangers frõ the couenants of promes, &amp; had no hope, &amp; were without God in the worlde.

                13 But now in Christ Iesus, ye which once were farre of, are made nere by the
                  blood of Christ.

                14 For he is our peace, which hathe made of bothe one, &amp; hathe broken the
                  stoppe of the particion wall,

                15 In abrogating through his flesh the hatred, that is,
                  the Law of commandements which standeth in ordinances, for
                  to make of twaine one newe man in himself, so making
                  peace,

                16 And that he might reconcile bothe vnto God in one bodie by his crosse, &amp; slaye hatred thereby,

                17 And came, and preached peace to you wc were afarre
                  of, &amp; to them that were nere.

                18 For through him we bothe haue an entrance vnto the Father by one Spirit.

                19 Now therefore ye are no more strangers &amp; foreners: but citizens with the
                  Saintes, and of the housholde of God,

                20 And are buylt vpõ the fundacion of the Apostles and Prophetes, Iesus Christ
                  him self being the chief corner stone,

                21 In whome all the buylding coupled together, groweth vnto an holie Temple in
                  the Lord,

                22 In whome ye also are buylt together to be the habitation of God the
                  Spirit.

                  281–99] ¶ Wiues,
                  submit your selues vnto your housbands, as vnto the Lord.

                23 For the housband is the wiues head, euẽ as Christ is the head of the Church,
                  &amp; the same is the sauiour of his bodie.

                24 Therefore as the Church is in subiectiõ to Christ, euen so let the wiues be to their housbands in euerie
                  thing.

                25 ¶ Housbands, loue your wiues, euen as Christ loued the Church, &amp; gaue him
                  self for it,

                26 That he might sanctifie it, &amp; clẽse it by the washing of water through
                    ye worde,

                27 That he might make it vnto him self a glorious Church, not hauĩg spot or
                  wrincle, or anie suche thing: but that it shulde be holie and without blame.

                28 So oght men to loue their wiues, as their owne bodies: he that loueth his
                  wife, loueth him self.

                29 For no mã euer yet hated his owne flesh, but nourisheth &amp; cherisheth it,
                  euẽ as the Lord doeth the Church.

                30 For we are mẽbers of his bodie, of his flesh, and of his bones. . . . 

                33 Therefore euerie one of you, do ye so: let euerie one
                  loue his wife, euẽ as him self, &amp; let the wife se that she feare her housband.

                  be obedient vnto them that are your masters, according to
                  the flesh, with feare and trembling in singleness of your hearts as vnto
                  Christ, . . . 

                9 And ye masters, do the same things vnto them, putting away threatning: &amp;
                  knowe that euen your master also is in heauẽ, nether is there respect of persone
                    wt him.
                

                10 ¶ Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
                  might.

                11 [tln

                  the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the assauts of the
                  deuil.

                12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
                  against powers, and against the worldlie gouernours, the princes of the darkenes of this worlde, against spiritual

                13 For this cause take vnto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to
                  resist in the euil daye, &amp; hauing finished all things, stand fast.

                14 Stand therefore, and your loines girde about with veritie, &amp; hauing on the

          Shakespeare’s Use of the Bible

          Upton (1748,
            pp. 323–4 n.), commenting on 263–8, first notes Acts 19 as a reason Sh. chose to
            set the play in Ephesus. See n. 2.

          Bullough (1957,
            1:9–10) first elaborates the influence of Ephesians beyond the mere reputation of
            Ephesus as a city Paul visits in Acts 19: But
              why substitute Ephesus [for Epidamnus]?

          
            His choice was, I believe, connected with his interest in family
              relationships, and also with his desire to make The Comedy a
              play of wonders in which every loose end should finally be tied up. Ephesus was well
              known to Elizabethans as the capital of Roman Asia, a great seaport, renowned for its
              Temple of Diana and as the place where St Paul stayed two years (Acts xix). The Epistle to the Ephesians includes
              earnest exhortations to domestic unity. [He quotes 5:22–33.] [10] The Apostle also writes of relations
              between children and parents, and urges servants to be obedient unto them that
                are your masters, while masters are to forbear threatening their servants
                (VI.1–9). Is it fanciful to suggest that
              Shakespeare saw the aptness of this as he christianized somewhat the ethics of
              Plautus’s comedy? Does the Ephesian locale explain why the Mother becomes an Abbess,
              in reminiscence of the Temple of Diana with its priestesses?
          

          In addition, Ephesus was a place of sorcerers and exorcists, and
                curious arts as St Paul states. Of this idea Shakespeare makes good
              use. See n. 2.

          Foakes (ed.
            1962, p. xxix) acknowledges Bullough’s citations, and adds Eph. 4:22–4,
            and 6:11–17 in his Appendix 1, pp. 113–15, collating
            Geneva and Bishops’.

          Parker (Anagogic Metaphor, 1983, pp. 38–9) writes about anagogic metaphor
            and breaking down the wall of partition. [It is perhaps useless to object that what
            separates the twins in Act 3 is a door, not a wall, a fact that might hinder an
            audience’s getting an allusion to Eph.] She cites Eph. 2:14–15
              (Authorized Version): For he [Christ] is our peace, who hath made both
              one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us [Jew and
              Gentile] . . . for to make in himself of twain one new man. She explains:
                Breaking down the wall of partition . . . joins the rending
              of the veil of the temple as a radical crossing or abolition of boundaries; and both
              link the Crucifixion to the anagogy it figures, the final apocalyptic [39] removal of partition walls.

          Idem (1987, pp. 17 ff.) expands Anagogic
              Metaphor, 1983, adding how the rhetorical figure geminatio, the doublet, pervades the language, structure, and
            plot of the play, dramatizing the biblical narrative of the twins Jacob and Esau.

          Kinney (1988,
            pp. 36–8, 48, 50): Here [Eph.] we find in the Christian New Testament,
              rather than in Roman farce, the source that inspired all parts
              of The Comedy of Errors—that gives it its overall shape and
              significance, not only mixing with but embodying and transforming Plautine
              conventions. This summary comes not in the sermon on order and on the directions for
              husbands and wives, parents and children that has often been cited from Ephesians 6, . . . but in the summary of life’s
              experiences in Ephesians 2 (a text as popular with
              the Tudors as the later passage). This is a source which has never been cited in
              connection with The Comedy of Errors, but which proceeds from
              a statement on death not unlike Egeon’s through the sin and confusion of the play’s
              chief action and finally to the last transformation of spirit before the priory.
                And you hathe he quickened, Paul writes [Eph. 2:2–10]. [37] This is the Ephesus the Elizabethans knew by trained instinct, not
              Shakespeare’s. The enforced segregation of Syracusan and Ephesian in the play—like the
              separation of Jews from Gentiles and Christians from Pharisees in the Bible—results
              from human sin and hostility which focus on the wrong kind of transgression of the
              wrong kind of laws. The Elizabethans knew and understood that from childhood. Such
              divisive acts of fallen man, spurred on by evil lust and Satanic intention in
              Shakespeare’s play, were just those acts that God, Jesus, and Paul meant to heal by
                reunion. Thus the central theme of the letter to the
              Ephesians, and one which Elizabethan preachers proclaimed with cogency and simplicity,
              is not only that of order but that of a reuniting—we think of the speeches on reunion
              as a kind of transformation back into the original state in The
                Comedy of Errors [fn. to 199
              ff., 590–1, 1125–8, 1133–4, 1747–9]—and the same
              theme emphasized in the only drama written with Paul as its hero, the non-cycle Digby
              play known as The Conversion of St. Paul. . . . 

          
            Sensing this deeper organization in a play more integral and traditional
              than it is to us, the Tudors would see the end of The Comedy of [38] Errors, centered as it is on the Abbess, as natural
              and fitting. . . . 
          

          
            By changing the classical Epidamnum . . . to the Christian Ephesus
              associated with Paul . . . Shakespeare decisively if subtly shifts the generic
              expectations of an Elizabethan audience steeped in Scripture and the liturgical
              calendar from pure farce to something like a divine comedy in which emotional
              experiences and intellectual reflections portrayed by the characters are shared
              simultaneously by the playgoers despite their privileged knowledge of the twinned
              Antipholi and their twinned Dromios.
          

          He finds the mixture of farce and serious Christian spirituality of the morality plays
            influential on Err., as well as such thematic phrasing as (p.
            48) the strikingly appositive last petition of the litany in the Book of
            Common Prayer, Thoughe we be tyed and bounde with the chayne of our synnes, yet
              let the pitifulness of thy great mercy lose vs, and, from the General
            Confession at Morning Prayer, We ha[u]e erred and straied from thy waies, lyke
              lost shepe.

          (P. 50): The wonders of the religious drama highlight the piling on of wonders
              that is the concluding movement of The Comedy of Errors, yet
              none is more wonderful than this: that so short a play—actually Shakespeare’s
              briefest—moves all the way from the Nativity to the Last Judgment, spanning not only
              the life of the Christian but all Christian history as well. That too is the essential
              idea behind Paul’s letter to the Ephesians and so may also lie behind Shakespeare’s
              choice of scene.

          Hunt (1997, pp.
            31 ff.) enlarges the notion of slavery, arising out of the uniquely large number of
            beatings the Dromios suffer, to include de facto slavery: The playwright’s focus
              on de facto slavery widens to encompass the institution of marriage and the
              individual’s ordering of his or her inner faculties. Implicitly Shakespeare poses a
              dramatic question: do the reunions and festive releases celebrated at the end of
                The Comedy of Errors include a remedy for slavery, whether
              of the social, marital, or existential variety? He canvasses Err. criticism to show how the beatings are generally explained away, usually
            because farce invites violence, but he disagrees that the beatings are unimportant. The
            answer to his question above is that the play does provide a remedy, one based on Eph.,
            characterized (p. 54) as Paul’s radical anti-enslavement message. . . . For
              informed playgoers, pertinent passages in Ephesians operate as a subtext in
              Shakespeare’s play, providing a corrective for the enslavement of servants, spouses,
              and parts of the self even when dramatic characters do not expressly voice and act out
              the texts.

          Other commentators do not focus on specific books and epistles:

          Birch (1848,
            pp. 121 ff.) is scandalized by Sh.’s impiety: This play was made . . . to be
              more Christian than Pagan, in order to be at ease in comedy, and witty at the expense
              of Christianity, which was better for that purpose than Paganism. Of 1231–50
            (p. 123): Here is a famous quotation from scripture, introduced to make low jokes
              on the worst subjects. Do such associations bespeak a reverential mind?

          Weld (1975, pp.
            156–7, 167–8): This play . . . asks us to see a human being threatened
              with the legal judgment of death, and the total concept of human nature implied by the
              play must somehow include this view too. . . . 

          [157] He [Aegeon, 38] stands condemned qua human being, for original sin, for nature,
              not vile offense. . . . 

          
            Clearly the relevant concept of human nature is the one Lyly had
              exploited, the one common at the time, taught in catechism, sermon, and treatise,
              which saw man as condemned by justice for his corrupt and fallen nature to a death
              from which only a ransom he could not meet could save him. It saw him also as doomed
              by that nature to err, and comic in that error.
          

          After rehearsing the comic errors, he comes to Act 5, Aemilia’s entrance with the twins
            that clears matters up. (P. 167): Now these events are presented on the
              stage as parts of one action. They occur simultaneously; they are immediate and
              visible results of Aemilia’s entrance, and they are themselves closely
              related. . . . 

          
            The theatrical identity is also thematic. Most obviously the events
              constitute a happy ending. . . . Clarity has succeeded error; harmony, discord; and
              mercy has tempered justice. By the law Aegeon is still con­[168]demned [but the Duke pardons him]. This is . . . fantasy, at least in
              effect. The legal point is avoided. The one point relevant is made: Aegeon is set
              free. Man will not die for his nature. Charity has replaced justice. The Old Law is
              dead. . . . 
          

          
            The events . . . reflect three aspects of the central fact of man’s
              redemption, which, within the Christian frame of things, is what makes comedy with a
              happy ending possible. The ending is still within the human situation,
              however. . . . Confusion has not quite ended. The chance for error still
              remains. . . . This sort of mistaking [1848–60] is no longer dangerous, but it is there, and it
              is comic. Human beings may be saved from the tragic consequences of their nature, but
              they remain human and fallible and funny.
          

          
          Parker (1996,
            pp. 56 ff.): The master narrative of Jacob and Esau influences the play;
            she repeats much of her earlier essays’ use of Ephesians and the Apocalypse. (P. 64):
              Echoes of Jacob and Esau . . . hover around the edges of this discussion of
              whether something lost—an heir as well as hair—can ever be recovered. There’s
                many a man hath more hair than wit [476–7] . . . could be said . . . of Esau, the
                hairy man who, outwitted by his usurping twin, loses his right as the
              elder son or heir. The Genesis story of a father with two twin sons . . . could yield
              the mock-learned conclusion here (thou didst conclude hairy men to be plain
                dealers without wit) [480–1]. Jacob, often called bald in contrast to
            hairy Esau, becomes the rightful heir by covering himself with the
                lost hair of another man. For this Esau there might indeed be said to
              be no time to recover [466]
              (in Heb. 12:17, deprived of his blessing, he
              finds no place to repentance, as the Geneva Bible puts it). No time for
              recovery in this sense would suggest the absence of the space and time for repentance
              and redemption, which is the principal reason for the interim of delay and reprieve
              before what this exchange invokes, once again, as the world’s end, or
              Doom. . . . 

          [81] The sheer number of its biblical and
              morality play allusions has led some critics to assumptions that are [82] strenuously theological, however discordant this emphasis
              might be with other elements within the play. But the summoning of the teleological
              master narrative of the Bible in Shakespeare’s Comedy is
              finally something less theological than it is . . . a source of metaphors for
              dramatic structure, detached from belief or homiletic piety. What we have in
              Shakespeare’s plays—even in such a self-consciously and densely biblical one as this
              early comedy—is something closer to what C. L. Barber termed
                post-Christian. The critic of Shakespeare . . . must be
              prepared . . . both to recognize the identifications forged by such allusive
              networks—beyond the apparently marginal importance of the isolated verbal quibble—and
              to consider what is being done to as well as through such authoritative structures.
          

        





        
          The Book of Common Prayer

          Hassel (1979,
            pp. 39 ff.) proposes, as part of a larger study on the ways plays were chosen to accord
            with themes of the church year as laid out in the Book of Common Prayer, that Err. is appropriate to Holy Innocents’ Day, 28 Dec., the feast
            commemorating Herod’s slaughter of the children aged two years and under in Jerusalem
            and its environs. Err. was played on that feast in 1594 (Gray’s
            Inn) and in 1604 at court: Error seems to have been the traditional hallmark of
              Innocents’ celebrations. . . . The reason . . . is the centuries-old tradition of
              beginning the Feast of Fools on Childermas or Innocents’ Day. Until the time of the
                Spectator, Innocents was considered for this reason
                the most unlucky day in the calendar, it certainly is so to the
              inhabitants of Ephesus. Even the abundance of ass and ass-head jokes in the play may
              have had elusive connections to the festival tradition, since an ass was
            sometimes led down cathedral aisles, marking Christ’s humility. He grants that this
            tradition was not much used in England and was well suppressed by the middle of the 16th
            c.

          (P. 40): A glance at the liturgical tradition of Innocents’ Day makes
              it even less likely that mere nostalgia or coincidence explains the dual performance
              of the play on that religious festival. The repetition of nativitie in the final lines . . . seems to suggest a general awareness of
              the Christmas season. More specifically, as soon as we read the proper
              Lesson [scripture reading appointed for the day] prescribed for Holy Innocents’ Day in
              the Book of Common Prayer, we are struck by relationships to
              the framing story of Egeon and Emilia, Shakespeare’s unique addition to his sources.
                Jer. 31:1–17 [the Old Testament proper], like the framework
              of The Comedy of Errors, is about [41]
              the dispersal and reunion of families. In fact, from such other prescribed passages as
                Bar. 4:21–30, Matt. 2:13–18, Rev. 14:1–5, and Isa. 60, we realize
              that this theme was a central motif of the liturgical festival.

          
            Dealing as it does with the Lord’s promise to reunite the dispersed and
              weeping families of Israel, Jeremiah 31 is
              insistently parallel to the first and final scenes of Errors.
              After the Lord’s several promises to gather the remnant of Israel from the coasts of
              the world, verses 15–17, on the ultimate
              deliverance of all innocents, seem particularly close to the situation and the
              sensibility of Egeon and Emilia, parents of their own lost children: 15 A voice was heard on hie, a mourning and bitter weping,
                  Ra&lt;c&gt;hel weping for her children, . . . because thei were not.
                16 Thus saith the Lord, Refraine thy voice from weping, and thine eyes from
                  teares: for thy worke shalbe rewarded, saith ye Lord, and thei shal come againe
                  from the land of the enemie.
                17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shal come
                  againe to their owne borders. In the other prescribed passages the
              theme remains the same: innocents have been scattered or displaced by their enemies,
              but they will eventually be returned home, even if that home is with the Lamb in
              heaven [Rev. 14]. . . . 
          

          [42] That the lords of Gray’s Inn had just been
              absolved of their own guilt by the prince of Purpoole, thus becoming themselves
              mock-innocents and fools, may have heightened both the absurd and the serious
              dimensions of the parallel. They could hardly have hoped to see a more pertinent
              entertainment on the night of 28 December. [It may be objected, however, that
            Psalm 79 and the Collect emphasize death and penitence, e.g., Almighty God, whose prayse this daye the yong innocentes thy witnesses hath
              confessed and shewed forth, not in speaking but in dying; Mortifye and kyll all vyces
              in us from the Collect. Such a tone would not befit a revels.]

        





        
          The Book of Homilies

          For the possible influence of the homilies, see Baldwin (1962) on 251–99, 385–9, and 525–41.

          
          Hennings (1986,
            pp. 96 ff.), on the debate between Adriana and Luciana in 2.1: The
              general tenor of Luciana’s remarks is inconsistent with the description of a happily
              married couple found in the current marriage literature, especially with that of
                the . . . Homilie of the state of
              Matrimonie. . . . 

          
            It challenges the older Catholic claim that procreation is the primary
              purpose of marriage with the Protestant view of its true and original purpose:
                It is instituted of GOD . . . that man and woman should liue lawfully in a
                perpetuall friendship ([Certaine Sermons, 1968,] p.
                239). . . . [97] Explicitly contradicting Luciana’s defense
              of the double standard, the homily defines the grand folly of human nature: For
                this folly is euer from our tender age growne [v]p with us, to haue a desire to
                rule, to thinke highly of our selfe, so that none thinketh it meet to giue place to
                another. That wicked vice of stubborne will and selfe loue, is more meet to breake
                and to disseuer the loue of heart, then to preserue concorde (p.
              240).
          
          

          Paraphrasing the homily, he continues: Husbands must strive to be of
              one will with their wives [Eph. 5:21–33], and therefore they
              must become humble. They must be understanding, attentive, and compassionate, and they
              must instruct by edifying example. To be sure, wives too must be meek and humble, and
              they must willingly obey their husbands as Sarah did Abraham—yet the exemplary pattern
              of a husband is not Abraham. In one of the most remarkable instances of the influence
              of Renaissance humanism on Christian thought, the official Anglican sermon declares
              that the ideal husband . . . is the pagan Socrates, who meekly endured
              the euill manners of his shrewish wife so that he might bee the
                more quiet with others, being thus dayly exercised and taught in the forbearing of
                her (p. 247).

          It is precisely because the sermon wants to change the older thinking
              about marital roles that it instructs the husband in meekness and patience and
              humility. An indifferent, uncaring, or domi­[98]neering
              husband is not a good Christian. So, he concludes, those who take Luciana to
            be the play’s authority on marriage are wrong. See , for his analysis of Luciana.

        

      







      
        Gower, Apollonius of Tyre

        Sh. knew this romance from John Gower, in Bk. 8, Confessio
            Amantis, printed in 1483, 1532, and 1554; from Laurence Twine’s prose version,
            The Patterne of Painefull Aduentures (STC 709, revised STC 709 and 709.5, entered in S.R. 1576); or from both. Sh. apparently
          used Gower (1554) for Per., as well as Twine’s Patterne, perhaps in an ed. of 1607. The STC entry is
            1594?. That uncertainty is removed in the revised STC. If Sh. used Twine, it would settle the date of composition, but the
          evidence is inconclusive. In Twine, but not in Gower, Apollonius’s wife is named Lucina,
          leading Bullough
          (1957, 1:50) and Foakes (ed. 1962, p. xxxi) to mistakenly give her the name in Gower where
          in fact she is nameless. There is no other evidence that Sh. used Twine for Err.
          Lucina looks promising as a hint for Luciana, but the contrasting
          Adriana-Luciana (see ) probably better
          accounts for the name.

        The following extracts, slightly different from Bullough’s, are from ed. 1554 (STC 12144), a quarto in black letter; I have used a microfilm of that quarto.
          The black letter has been changed to roman, but otherwise this text follows Q except for
          the substitution of s for long s. The quarto
          has both foliation and signatures; I give only the foliation. TLNs in the right margin
          refer to entries in the Commentary that discuss or point to parallels in Err. The following parallels have been found (numbers are Err. TLNs): 65–80, 104–6, 1504, 1825–31.

        Bullough (1957,
          1:10–11, 50, 53), summarizing: For the discovery of the
            Mother [in Err.] he took hints from the story of Apollonius of
            Tyre, which had been retold by Gower in Confessio Amantis (and
            was to influence Pericles years later). [11] The tale has more than one storm at sea, a husband separated from his wife
            and child, and a mother who undergoes strange adventures. . . . Like the Mother in
            Shakespeare she becomes abbesse of the Temple of Diana in Ephesus and is
            reunited to her husband and child after many years. . . . 

        [50] Apollonius’s wife Lucina, having given birth
            to a daughter on board ship, seems to die, and is put into a chest which floats to
            Ephesus and is taken up by a physician named Cerimon who revives the
            lady. . . . 

        [53] After many years, when the daughter Thais has
            been saved from a brothel and is reunited to her father, Apollonius is told in a vision
            to go to the Temple of Diana at Ephesus.

        Wislicenus (1879,
          p. 95), thinking Per. was very early, compares the description of
          the storm in Per. Prologue to Act 3 with Egeon’s description in
          1.1 and calls it a source for Err. In so doing, he points to
            Apollonius of Tyre, without specifying that it is a source for
            Err. That possibility was taken up quite gingerly for a while.
            Baldwin (ed.
          1928, p. xx), without noting Wislicenus or Gower: At least one Greek romance seems
            also to have made a contribution to the play. For part of his setting Shakespeare is
            indebted to the story of Appolonius [sic] of Tyre. There the wife of Appolonius,
            supposedly dead and cast into the sea, floats to Ephesus, where she is revived and
            becomes a nun in the Temple of Diana. . . . It would seem that this nun
            of Ephesus, under the local influence of Holywell Priory . . . came to be the Abbess of
            that institution in Ephesus.
          Chambers (1930,
          1:311): The Comedy of Errors has elaborated and varied the
            intrigue [from Plautus] and added the enveloping action. Possibly the story of
            Apollonius of Tyre, used for Pericles . . . may have given a
            hint for this.
          Gill (1930, p. 56)
          takes it for granted that Sh. used Apollonius.
          The following points are common to The Comedy of Errors
            and the tale: (1) a storm, a ship split upon a rock, and the father saved on a floating
            bit of the ship (a plank in one instance, a mast in the other), (2) the mother saved
            from the sea (in a chest in the tale, on a mast in the play) and rescued by fishermen
            [she is mistaken; the father is saved by a fisherman], only to be
            separated long years from her family, who also are separated from each other, (3) a
            child lost to both parents, (4) a mother going into retreat in a religious house, of
            which she becomes head, (5) the chance meeting, recognition, and happy reunion of the
            family, (6) the place of the reunion at Ephesus, before a priory in the play, and in a
            temple in the tale. By Kittredge (ed. 1936, p. 133), doubt has ceased.

        Tillyard (1965,
          pp. 47–8): However stylized and matter-of-fact Roman comedy was, it retained some
            faint trace of its more romantic ancestry through its motives of recognitions of lost
            children, its closeness to the sea, its allusions to shipwreck and pirates. It thus
            connects remotely with the Greek novel . . . however widely it diverged from it.
            Shakespeare exploited this connection by enclosing his Plautine farce [48] in a framework derived from the Greek novel [Apollonius of
              Tyre].

      





      
        Other Sources and Influences

        The extent to which Italian drama influenced Sh. is not fully known or agreed on. What
          follows are the strongest arguments for that influence through either the scripted
          comedies, called commedia erudita early in
          the 16th c. and, with slight changes, commedia
            grave later, or the commedia
            dell’arte or improvised theater, based on stock scenarios acted by
          professional players. The proponents say that Sh. could have found all the non-Plautine
          elements he either invents or imports from romance sources in this Italian theater.

        Sarrazin (1897,
          p. 105) suggests that several Italian plays have similar contents without necessarily
          being sources: Trissino’s Simillimi, Cecchi’s Le
            Moglie, and Agnolo Firenzuola’s I Lucidi.

        Lea (1934, 2:434
          ff.) gets around any influence on Sh. himself by accepting Wilson’s (ed. 1922) hypothesis that Sh.
          revised an old play which, she says, first embodied the commedia dell’arte aspects she details: Certain
            resemblances to the Commedia dell’arte may be accounted for as direct borrowings taking
            place most probably at a pre-Shakespearian stage of development. No single scenario has
            come to light which could be regarded as a source for either of these plays [Tmp. and Err.], but the more we know of the
            nature of the Commedia dell’arte the less we expect the evidence of contact between the
            two dramas to take this form: the scenari should not be studied singly but as they group
            themselves into the stage traditions of the farces of mistaken identity and the comic
            pastorals or shipwreck plays. . . . 

        
          The coincidence of the action of the Comedy of
              Errors with all the chief features of the plays of mistaken doubles in the
            Commedia dell’arte is almost complete, but something must [435]
            be allowed for a common inheritance from . . . Plautus. . . . [But t]he scene in which
            the courtesan lures Antipholus of Syracuse in spite of Dromio’s warning [?4.3;
            Antipholus resists her from her entrance], Pinch’s dealings with the madman, Dromio of
            Ephesus announcing his freedom [she is thinking of Messenio; Dromio has no such speech],
            are nearer to the Latin than to any modifications which survive in
            Italian. . . . 
        

        
          But when we come to consider the amplifications of the Menaechmi theme it is obvious that while the classical comedy was
            Shakespeare’s ultimate it was not his immediate model. These amplifications fall into
            three groups: the framework concerning the Duke, Aegeon, and the Abbess; the
            introduction of Luciana as a confidante for Adriana and a wife for Antipholus of
            Syracuse; and the addition of twin slaves which brings about the extra complications of
            the cooling dinner, the lost purse, and the disputes over the rope-end and the
            unpaid-for chain.
        

        She spends several pages hypothesizing three stages of the play, Sh.’s being the third.
          (P. 438): Whoever was elaborating the Menaechmi
            theme in order to produce a farce for the English players seems to have been acquainted
            with the ways in which the comedy of mistaken identity was exploited on the Italian
            stage. The details of the variations played upon the confusion of twin lovers, masters,
            fathers, and servants may be studied in detail in the representative scenari printed in
            the Appendix [not reprinted here]. . . . To have seen the see-saw action of a
              doubles play with its denials, beatings, jeerings, defiances,
            jealousies, and apologies and to have caught up the mere suggestion of doubling those
            doubles would be enough for this diviner of the springs of laughter.

        
          By status the Dromios of Shakespeare’s play are the slaves of Latin
            comedy, but in behaviour and misfortunes they are the servants of the Commedia
            dell’arte. They are beaten as regularly as any Zanni and for the same reasons. The
            excuses that provoke misunderstandings are ordinary enough, the misdelivery of any
            message or trinket will serve. In Li sei Simili it is actually
            a ring and a chain that are mislaid.
        

        She summarizes a scenario that bears close resemblances to Err.,
          but concludes that Sh. refined the sentiments of both Plautus and any scenario he (or the
          fashioners of the play which preceded his version) might have seen (p. 442): The
            sympathetic treatment of the women gives some support to the theory that as Shakespeare
            revised he refined. Plautus made Menaechmus’ wife a mere scold; Flavia in Locatelli’s
            version is almost equally wronged by Silvio and she rebounds; but Adriana yields and
            seeks to know her fault. In the Commedia dell’arte the neglected lady who suspects that
            her husband has found some fresh attraction, flames up with jealous anger, but
          Adriana is more grieved than angry.

        Sh.’s additions of pathos and gravity lead us to suspect that already he was
            working away from the farcical Italian material with which the Comedy
              of Errors at some stage of development had come into contact.
          Lea’s account
          absolves Sh. of coarseness but encourages studying a more nearly contemporary handling of
          Plautine material than Gill (1930), with her closely observed analysis of the Latin, could
          suggest.

        Bond (1938, p.
          50) proposes Giovammaria Cecchi’s L’ammalata (The Invalid, 1555) as the source for at least that part of Err. involving Aemilia’s status as abbess and healer, located in a story that
          has other general similarities with Err., as Lea shows to be utterly common in
          Italian 16th-c. imitations of Plautus. He grants that the parallels are insignificant,
            but may well be worth mention as between plays of different nationality perhaps
            forty years apart. The clinching point is that in both L’Ammalata and the Errors the long-lost wife or
            mother is a nun in a monastery, famous for her medical skill, the exercise of which
            precipitates the dénouement. As Lea says, there is no good reason to expect to
          find a certain particular Italian source for Err.

        Clubb (1968, pp.
          240 ff.) summarizes Italian theatrical visits to England in the latter half of the 16th
          c.: There are only a few proved connections to support Stephen Gosson’s famous
            complaint that Italian comedies were ransackt to furnish the Playe houses in
              London.

        She lists plays translated or adapted in England, cites Queen Elizabeth’s interest in
            Comedia Italiana, records the seven visits of Italian players between
          1546 and 1578, and concludes that (p. 241) by 1591 the traffic seems to
            have been brisk enough to make disguise as Italian entertainers desirable to foreign
            spies. . . . 

        [242] Certain features [of commedia erudita] became commonplaces . . . : the cast of
            middle-class families and their servants, pedants, soldiers, innkeepers, friars, and
            courtesans, joined in a series of encounters on the street, in doorways, and at windows;
            the combination of spatially and temporally restricted farcical intrigue with a
            potentially romantic antecedent history; the pattern of misunderstanding, disguise, and
            mistaken identity, kept moving and finally solved by peripeties and recognitions. While
            the playwrights customarily boasted in their prologues of debts to Plautus, Terence, and
            Boccaccio, the pieces they borrowed were reassembled to create a total different from
            the sum of its parts. In the process, they systematically outcomplicated the ancients
            and strained to do as much to one another.

        She describes the improvements in the moral tone of the commedia grave, one being an increase in emotional tension (p.
          245): Whatever the proportions, there was always a mixture of sentiment, pathos,
            and danger with lively comic action. The romantic potential in clichés of . . . trade
            wars, shipwreck, and kidnapping, causing separation of families . . . was now developed
            explicitly.

        The courtesan often (p. 246) becomes a strikingly more sympathetic
          figure.

        The plots grow increasingly complicated. (P. 247): More original than the
            doubling and recomplicating . . . was the use . . . of central themes and
            motifs. . . . 

        [248] The motif of supposed magic, specifically
            sorcery, alchemy, and astrology . . . in commedia
              grave is tied more closely than before to the language, as well as to
            whatever happens to be the theme for the variations. . . . 

        
          The theme of sorcery was frequently used in conjunction with or as a
            variation on the theme of madness.
        

        Concluding, she says that the time for looking for specific, immediate sources for Sh. is
          past (p. 251): There are many Italian regular comedies based on Menaechmi, but there is no reason to suppose that Shakespeare used any of
            them or to doubt that his sources were Plautus, Gower, and St. Paul. His choice of
            elements and his way of blending them, however, give pause. She lists the plot
          elements that find their counterparts in Italian comedy. The combination
            of these elements, characteristic of commedia
              grave, could not have been suggested by Lyly or Gascoigne, for both Mother Bombie and Supposes belong to the
            earlier type of regular comedy. . . . 

        
          It cannot be proved that Shakespeare read Italian plays, or saw commedia dell’arte troupes or Italian amateurs
            at Elizabeth’s court perform commedie
              gravi, or heard about them from a friend. Nor can The
              Comedy of Errors be labelled commedia
              grave, for Shakespeare’s most Italianate play is still not an Italian one.
            It is next to certain, however, that the brilliant young upstart crow knew something
            about the latest Continental fashion in comedy.
        

        Idem (1980, pp.
          130 ff.) proposes that Err. is part of a Continental experiment
          in expanding the limits of theater by writing mixed genre plays: In the
            early sixteenth century, when humanistically educated men of letters were producing
            experimental solutions to the problem of defining the classical genres of comedy and
            tragedy for vernacular culture, the commedia
              erudita frequently depended on the principle of contaminatio, of merging two plots, as Terence had defended
            doing in [the prologue to] Andria. . . . The practice of
            conflating individual units of action, character, and language from different sources
            had, even in the early commedie, sanctioned fusions of Roman
            comedy with pieces of the Decameron and Petrarchan
            imagery. . . . 

        
          The purpose of the calculated contaminations was to test the nascent rules
            of dramatic art and the possibility of inventing a third regular genre.
        

        She says that it is no longer possible to say that there (p. 131)
            was no important connection between Shakespeare and Italian
            drama. . . . This is a notion that time has hallowed but must now pass by. Its survival
            is made possible only [134; sic – pp. 132–3 contain plates] by
            ignoring the late cinquecento repertory of theatrical structures, generic figures and
            frames, or theatergrams, that are identifiable as movable parts also
            handled expertly and innovatively by Shakespeare. . . . 

        [135] What needs to be emphasized is not that
            Shakespeare improves upon his materials—no surprises there—but that he does so as if
            participating in the quest for mixed genres, aware of Continental theatrical trends
            while taking advantage of his English license to infringe neoclassical rules and to
            assay bolder variations and mixtures. . . . 

        [137] In The Comedy of
              Errors the materials he quarried from two Plautine comedies and from a number
            of other nondramatic sources are mixed and developed by the Italianate technique of
            multiple contaminatio, to bring comedy
            near to tragedy without transgressing the neoclassical ground rules, to achieve the
            fullest measure of complexity in pattern and to fit the whole as a metaphor for the
            appearance/reality relation of fortune/providence. She catalogs the elements
          that produce the mixture. Sh. was not adapting a specific Italian play but engaging in a
          Continental approach to comedy.

        Rébora (1925, p.
          239; and 1943, pp. 147–8), and Mellamphy (1980) also argue for the influence of commedia on Sh. Orr (1970, pp. 40–1)
          denies the influence.

        One strain of supposed influence on Err., especially in
          accounting for the non-Plautine aspects, is from medieval drama and romance. Wilson (ed. 1922, on
            1142): It is important to notice that
            S. Dromio’s mind is full of images from the old miracle and morality plays in this [4.2]
            and the following scene.

        Coghill (1950,
          pp. 2 ff.) provides a thumbnail history of critical theory describing comedy, from the
            Latin grammarians of the fourth century A.D., namely Evanthius, Diomedes and
            Donatus, through Vincent of Beauvais (ca. 1250) (p. 4): Comedy is a poem changing a sad beginning into a happy
            ending, . . . a tale of trouble that turned to joy.

        
          This simple formula is the true basis of Shakespearian Comedy.
        

        This he calls the Romantic view, contrasted to the Satiric view. (P. 7): The
            Renaissance view of Comedy was entirely different [from the medieval view]. Its only
            concern is ridicule. He cites Whetstone, introduction to Promos
            and Cassandra; Sidney; Puttenham; and Arte of
            Rhetoricke, chap 14.

        The reason why Renaissance theory and practice emphasized correction is that (p. 9)
            the older tradition was for Romance, the new world was all for Punishment. For
            the new world had to face the onslaught of Puritanism. If the right of poetry to exist
            at all was to be successfully defended, ethical weapons had to be used. . . . Faced by
            a choice in such matters, a writer is wise if he follows his temperament. Ben Jonson
            knotted his cat-o’-nine tails. Shakespeare reached for his Chaucer.

        Though Sh. starts out with Plautus, anyone caring for poetical forms . . . will
            find significant differences in the shapes of the two plays [Menaechmi and Err.]. It is not simply a matter of
            the doubling of the pairs of twins by the exuberant Elizabethan. It is a matter of a
            change of venue, of quality, and of catastrophe. He medievalized the story; he invented a beginning and an end for it,
            starting in trouble and ending in joy.

        He describes the Egeon-Aemilia story, the deferral of death, and the means of his deliverance. . . . 

        
          These modifications in Plautine structure can hardly have come about by
            accident or whim. And if by whim, how is it that the new shape should correspond so
            exactly with the medieval view of what is proper to comic form?
        

        
          This new shape brings with it an incidental feature in play-construction,
            in the conventions rather than in the form of English Comedy. It [10] fills the stage with the whole happy cast at the catastrophe. In the Menoechmi [sic] the play closes with the twins and their servant
            [sic] only on stage. Shakespearian and almost all subsequent comic drama in England
            closes with a stage cram full of happy people; the whole world of the play has been led
            into delight, and with it the whole audience.
        

        
          The changes in venue and structure go with a change in quality. It is not
            simply that there is a general coarseness and selfishness in Plautus’s personal
            relations that is not to be found in Shakespeare. There is a specific and medieval
            delicacy injected . . . by the invention of a romantic sub-plot—the love-affair between
            Antipholus of Syracuse and Luciana. Save for the greater lyrical fluency of Shakespeare
            it is Chaucerian, and its sentiments are those of amour courtois: [quotes 821–7].
        

        
          Love as the centre and solvent of all troubles could not absolutely govern
            this Comedy of mistaken identity, but it thrust its way into it and coloured the
            conclusion.
        

        Charlton (1931;
          1938, p. 70): Between Plautus and Luciana are the centuries in which chivalry and
            its achievements in life and letters had evolved the love which, like God, makes earth
            and man anew. The world which is enshrined in mediæval romance was embedded in the
            inherited experience of the sixteenth century. Even when he was recoiling from
            romanticism, Shakespeare could not divest himself of the romantic. And so these alien
            elements are stuffed within his imitation of a classical play.

        Matthews (1962,
          p. 84), without elaborating: Men had not forgotten the dichotomy of Justice and
            Mercy central in the miracle plays, but in sixteenth century drama it lay dormant until
            Shakespeare, with some apparent incongruity, brought it life once more in The Comedy of Errors.

        Salingar (1974,
          pp. 26, 59, 65–6): In broad terms, the romantic elements in his plays spring from
            the Middle Ages, while his sense of comic irony stems from the Roman playwrights and his
            feeling for comedy as festivity expresses the culture of the renaissance. It was a
            decisive mark of his genius as a playwright that he could bring into unity this
            diversity of traditions.

        (P. 59) Writing about Egeon and Apollonius, he thinks that Sh.’s
          acquaintance with Greek romances from such collections as the Golden
            Legend was wide and influenced him.

        (P. 65): As stories involving the extraordinary reunion of twin brothers, both the
            Clement and Eustace legend are related to Plautus’s Menaechmi . . . ; and it seems likely that Shakespeare remembered both legends
            when constructing his own play. The way Egeon’s family has been separated—the rock
            splitting their mast after the shipwreck, the two ships each rescuing one of the parents
            and one of the children, but unable to join, and then the grown son leaving his father
            to find his brother . . . —recalls the father’s tantalizing, successive losses in the
            Placidas [i.e., Saint Eustace] story; while Shakespeare’s dénouement—the prepared
            execution transformed into a scene of rejoicing—could have been suggested to him by the
            similar ending devised by Barnabe Riche. And the dénouement . . . also borrows from the
            Clement legend (as well as from Apollonius, which Shakespeare
            is following to the extent of locating his play at Ephesus and making the mother an
              Abbess there). In the Clement legend, Peter’s enemy, Simon Magus
              (Simon the enchanter), wishing to escape from execution as a magician,
            casts his own appearance on Clement’s father—in Caxton’s translation, he
              imprinted his similitude and likeness in this old man Faustinian, in such wise that of
              every man he was supposed to be Simon Magus; with the result that, although
            the sons recognise their father’s voice, they would run away from him but
            for St Peter’s intervention. Egeon meets with a similar [66]
            incomprehension from Antipholus of Ephesus, just before the other twin comes back on the
            stage: [quotes 1775–91]. There is nothing like this in the Apollonius story; but transformation
            by strange means, the proximity of an enchanter or conjurer . . . , the
            quasi-biblical setting and the danger of an execution are details all common here to the
            play and the saint’s legend. Here, then, where Shakespeare is bringing to a climax the
            tale of Egeon as a man tried by fate or Providence over a period of many years, it is
            clear that he is not following one narrative source alone but fusing scattered incidents
            together from a broad tradition of exemplary romance.

        Hardison (1980,
          pp. 316–18): As soon as one moves beyond these obviously classical
            features [The play is set in Ephesus, a suitable classical location, and its
              characters appear to be taken from the Sears catalogue of ancient comic types: the
              tricky servant, the lively courtesan, the indignant husband, the shrewish
            wife], however, the image changes. The earliest recorded performance . . . was
            for the [317] members of Gray’s Inn on Holy Innocents’ Day, 28
            December 1594, in connection with the annual revels of the Lord of Misrule. Although the
            play was probably performed before 1594 on the public stage, its selection for the
            revels may tell us something significant about Shakespeare’s comic art.

        
          It puts the play in the context of a medieval festival that had survived
            in Protestant England to the closing years of the sixteenth century and that had as its
            most essential feature the reversal of all the rules of logic, decorum, and
            verisimilitude.
        

        Sh. has added a Christian framework derived from Apollonius.
          The Abbess . . . who has no business being in a Plautine comedy but is certainly a
            welcome guest at the feast of the Lord of Misrule, turns out to be the long-lost wife of
            Aegeon. She produces a secular miracle, but a miracle nevertheless. We
            are dealing with a medieval play dressed up in a toga, not the reverse.

        Adriana is a shrew who has sensibilities; S. Antipholus woos Luciana in the language of a
          Petrarchan sonnet, not of the Age of Augustus.

        (P. 318): Then there is the cook [Luce]. Nothing quite like the cook
            exists in classical drama. The whole play stops for the cook, who is drawn from the same
            current of medieval realism that produced the works of Rabelais and
            Grobius. . . . 

        
          The spirit of classical comedy is linear. It moves forward from episode to
            episode according to rational principles of necessity or probability . . . opposite in
            mood and in detail of the slapstick wonderland of The Comedy of
              Errors.
        

        Kinney (1988, pp.
          39 ff.), writing about how Err. mingles kinds (his
          title) by being about, in his view, Eph. 2, hence the life of
          man: It is this simultaneity of two frames of time—both in the generations
            represented by Egeon and Antipholus of Syracuse and in the implied past and future—that
              The Comedy of Errors draws its confusion and its resolution.
            This it shares with the native English tradition of the miracle play, such as the Digby
            play of St. Paul, the Digby Mary Magdalene, and the Wakefield
              Secunda Pastorum.

        At first it is hard to see any connections between the play and the medieval drama. (P.
          40): But in this instance . . . our conventional expectations betray us. If we
            recall Mak and his farcical transformation of sheep for baby as a parallel to the
            Nativity in the Secunda Pastorum, or think of the brawling of
            Noah’s wife or the double-dealing of Cain, events analogous to those in The Comedy of Errors, or the juxtaposition of Egeon’s grief alongside the
            Dromios’ antics with the mingling of potential tragedy and lively comedy in the Noah
            play and the Brome Abraham and Isaac, we will be closer to the
            expectations and realizations of the audiences to whom Shakespeare’s first actors
            played. Much like the language of the Secunda
            Pastorum . . . is the language of orthodox Christianity that The Comedy of Errors refuses to ignore [quoting 308–9, 535, 561].

        He marshals scholarship that shows Sh. adapting the medieval drama in tragedies and
          history plays. (P. 42): The form and features of the mystery cycles are pervasive
            in The Comedy of Errors. The cycles began with serious
            treatments of the fall (and death) of Adam (needing, like Egeon, to be
            saved in the person or representative of Christ), moved into knockabout farce with plays
            on Cain and Abel (much as we witness with the treatment of the two Dromios), and then
            restored high seriousness in showing how Christ’s love conquered travail and sin (as
            with the increasing seriousness of the final scenes of Shakespeare’s play). Even
          the staging of some cycle plays, where neutral playing places served for simultaneous
          staging and took on moral signification, makes Err. familiar. (P. 43): Following these plays, The
              Comedy of Errors depicts a representative mankind falling into confusion;
            distracted by worldly things (like a cloak and a chain [he is confusing Menaechmi here]) of a mercantile world, such as the merchants of Ephesus whom
            St. Paul addresses; and vulnerable to desire (for an unnamed courtesan or Luciana) as
            the witchcraft Paul sees in Ephesus marked the Ephesians.

        Cox (1989, pp.
          61, 66–7): One of the consistent qualifications of socially differentiated style in
            Shakespeare’s early comedies is their openness to vestiges of medieval dramaturgy. If
            the well-made comedy was a sign of power, then Shakespeare’s early comedies deconstruct
            not only the well-structured play but the social assumptions that gave rise to the
            ruling idea of such a play in the first place.

        He discusses the distinction between the romantic frame plot and the main
          plot. (P. 66): In the context of this consistent distinction between the
            two stories . . . , we can see unmistakable allusions to the archetypal medieval drama
            that historically underlay the romantic plot. The romantic pattern of separation,
            wandering, and reunion, as David Bevington points out, derived directly from the moral
            pattern of fall from grace, temporary domination of evil, and rediscovery of divine
            favor—the structure that enabled travelling actors to adapt the vast drama of salvation
            history to the exigencies of a small troupe. What is therefore the oldest story in
            English drama permeates the language of the frame plot and contributes to its
            qualitative distinction from the newly fashionable classical action that it encloses.
              My fall is the play’s first rhyme phrase, followed closely by
              the doom of death: Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall / And by
              the doom of death end woes and all ([5–6]). I am not partial to infringe our
              laws, the stern duke insists, identifying himself with harsh perpetrators of
            the old law in medieval dramatic renderings of the history of salvation
              ([8]). Those who have not been able to
              redeem their lives before the duke of Syracuse have seal’d his
              rigorous statutes with their bloods ([13]). The familiar romantic dilemma of shipwreck, global wandering, and years
            of familial separation is thus reinforced with vestiges of the ageless theological
            dilemma of the fall of humankind and the law of sin and death. Occurring exclusively in
            the frame story, these casual hints add texture to other differences between it and the
            Plautine story.

        Archetypal drama is again implied in the play’s
            conclusion. . . . Liberation from error and the threat of death are physically enacted
            when Emilia recognizes Egeon: [quotes 1825–6]. He adduces Egeon’s ransomless freeing and
          the born again metaphor of 1896.

        
          The Comedy of Errors . . . is more of a hybrid than it
            appears to be at first, and the social implications of its style are therefore
            ambiguous. Its neoclassical plot and elegant economy represent an attempt to appropriate
            fashionable standards, and authorially such an attempt inevitably suggests a desire for
            the power and prestige that these standards represented—just as certainly as lower-class
            violation of Elizabethan sumptuary laws represented a desire for the status ascribed to
              upper-[67]class clothing. While this pursuit of status is most
            apparent in Shakespeare’s earliest comedies (and is probably strongest in The Comedy of Errors), it is a strategy for social mobility and
            preservation that Shakespeare never entirely abandons. . . . On the other hand,
            Shakespeare does not press this stratification as hard as he might, and he qualifies it
            dramaturgically in ways that soften and even reverse its social impact. The most
            effective image of renewed community . . . is presented by the servant twins as the
            play ends. In contrast to the enmity and discord [9], the rancorous outrage [10] with which the action begins and the classical plot
            compounds, the frame story concludes with the two Dromios walking amiably to a waiting
            feast.
        

        Hamilton (1967,
          p. 99): Madness culminates in metamorphosis. Here Shakespeare uses Ovid’s Metamorphoses, where emotions so overwhelm the characters that
            finally they are transformed.

        Other Ovidian echoes and possible influences are found in the Commentary.

        Groene (1894):
          Chaucer’s Knight’s Tale lies behind 1.1, where, as Groene is summarized by Velz (1968, p. 139),
            (the alien runs the risk of death to seek a loved one in a hostile land) and the
            close of the Arcadia where mistaken identity is clarified,
            saving a condemned person from death. Groene suggests that opposing classical and native
            sources was Sh’s usual habit of composition, but his argument for Chaucer and Sidney is
            now almost universally rejected; certainly both motifs are fairy tale
            commonplaces.

        Courthope (1903,
          pp. 81–2): But the more spiritual form of illusion [referring to 1448–61] found in The
              Comedy of Errors, as in the Induction to The Taming of the
              Shrew, is entirely mediæval, and was imported into those plays by Shakespeare
            from the examples furnished to him in Lyly’s Endimion, in which
            the action is affected by the agency of fairies, witches, enchanted fountains, and human
            beings transformed into trees. From Lyly, too, Shakespeare took the idea of [82] the underplot, in which some well-marked character, not
            absolutely necessary to the evolution of the main plot, is brought on stage to amuse the
            audience with his oddities and witty abuse of language. In The Comedy
              of Errors this part is filled by Dromio of Syracuse, and the following
            specimen of dialogue . . . will, when compared with the extract I have given from
              Mydas, furnish ample evidence of the cause of the change in
            Shakespeare’s comic manner: [quotes 443–502].

        John Lyly’s influence appears to have been considerable. Cuningham (ed. 1907, p. xxxvi) first
          notices that a Dromio appears in Mother Bombie. Bradbrook (1955, pp.
          50–1): The classic setting, with its three houses, the bewildering
            symmetry of the reduplicated twins harmonize with the quibbles and cross-talk, which is
            at times (as in the dialogue on Time and Hair between Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse
            in Act II) even more pedan­[51]tic than Lyly. It is also,
            however, a great deal more improper than Lyly, and this reflects the current taste of
            the young men who enjoyed the poems of Donne. . . . In doubling the twins, Shakespeare
            improved Plautus. This is a characteristically florid Elizabethan device; they liked
            adjectives in pairs, clauses in antitheses, and Lyly always provided at least two of
            everything.

        Bullough (1957,
          1:9): Mother Bombie is a play of duplicated effects and
            symmetry. It has no fewer than four comic servants who are sent on errands and then
            searched for by their masters (II.2), and it contains mistaken identities and lost
            children. Though no close analogue to our play, it supplied the name of its genial rogue
            who says: I have nothing to live by but knaverie, and if the world grow honest,
              welcome beggerie.
          Foakes (ed. 1962,
          pp. xxxiii ff.): There is no doubt that Shakespeare knew the elegant prose plays of
            John Lyly. . . . Of these plays, Mother Bombie, printed 1594,
            but acted probably in 1590, has closest affinities with The Comedy of
              Errors, as being modelled on Roman comedy, though its plot, in which a group
            of four gay and witty servants to four old men conspire against them in helping to
            forward the love-schemes of their masters’ children, is Terentian, rather than Plautine.
            One of the servants is named Dromio, and Shakespeare may have borrowed the name from
            this play. [fn.: It should be noted . . . that this name is a variant of Dromo, a type-name for a slave in several of Terence’s comedies.]
            His debt to Lyly, especially in the exchange between the Dromios and their masters, is
            too general and pervasive, however, to be reduced to a list of borrowings. It is
            possible to point to a number of phrases or images in Lyly’s works which recur or are
            echoed in Shakespeare’s play; for instance, I have noticed the following in Mother Bombie: beg him for a fool ([1.1.37; Err. 315]); the image of vine and elm ([1.3.124; 568]); of pulling a
            crow ([2.1.82; 744]); of the parrot crying rope ([3.4.57–8; 1326]);
              I had thought to have askt you ([4.1.36; 694]); there’s a time
              for al things ([5.3.15; 458–9]); sing til we catch cold on our
              feet ([5.3.88; 661]); but some of these are proverbial, and some are to be
            found in other authors of the period also. The number of such echoes has a cumulative
            weight, especially when, in addition, Shakespeare employs [xxxiv]
            formal devices he learned from Lyly, and in the mock dialectics of II.ii, and again in
            the catechism of III.ii, recalls similar passages in Midas.
            Lyly’s influence is felt finally in the tone of much of the comic dialogue, the
            cadences, the cheerful quibbling insolence of the servants, and the casual equality of
            speech between servant and master, who may nevertheless turn sharply on his
              villain at any minute.

        But Hunter (1962,
          pp. 300 ff.) thinks otherwise: The intrigue of The Comedy
              of Errors . . . shows an interest in patterning human behaviour, setting one
            level against another, which was an art in which Lyly was the obvious
          master.

        
          Whatever area of common ground Shakespeare shared with Lyly’s mode in
            comedy, there can be little doubt that the earliest Shakespearian plays show interests
            which are quite divergent from Lyly’s. . . . But the interest of the relationship is
            not . . . to be measured by a list of parallel passages. . . . I suppose that the
            point of comparing Lyly and the early Shakespeare is not to find out what Shakespeare
            took from Lyly. . . . What may be a more fruitful as well as a safer process is to seek
            a standpoint from which we can see the young Shakespeare differing from his models. . . . 
        

        The Comedy of Errors would seem to show
            Shakespeare’s natural tastes in comedy at a point where he had not absorbed [301] (or else absorbed and then rejected) the influence of Lyly.
            The play is . . . largely dependent on its [Plautine] sources . . . , and if we are to
            compare Lyly’s work with Shakespeare’s it would have to be in the additions and
            alterations to the originals. He lists the non-Plautine elements.

        (P. 302): Either Lyly’s influence has been so absorbed at the beginning of
            Shakespeare’s career that it does not show, or else it exercises little or no power. I
            take it that the latter is [more likely].

        Luciana brings a wholly non-Plautine atmosphere to the play, but not necessarily one
          founded on Lyly.

        
          I cannot find . . . that the scene where Antipholus woos
            Luciana marks a basic or pervasive break with tradition, or that Lyly is to be held
            responsible for its manner. It shows us the fairly obvious comedy of the innocent
            abroad, and of the man who protests too much—though in language of a new eloquence, I
            admit. What is new in the poetry is not its Lylian elegance . . . but rather the strong
            pathos of man’s loneliness, and this is something that runs counter to Lyly’s flippant
            and detached view of the man in love.
        

        [303] [Where Sh. is distinct from Plautus and
            Lyly] is the pathos with which Shakespeare indicates man to be the victim of error. . . . 

        [304] Shakespeare . . .  chose as his model the
            one Roman play in which no agents, jokers or intriguers are shown on the stage, in which
            the errors result from fate.

        Turner (1974, pp.
          204–5): John Lyly laid down the challenge to any playwright of the late 1580s and
            early 1590s who would display versatility with words. He set the pace by mock logic,
            riddles, and elaboration of fanciful metaphors which Shakespeare and some contemporaries
            took as models. . . . A comparison would show us that none of the University Wits came
            close to Shakespeare in adapting Lyly’s devices. For every verbal trick of Lyly’s we can
            find a counterpart in Shakespeare’s apprentice comedies. . . . [205] The ways in which Lyly exhibits verbal wit through the quick, unexpected
            but relevant response can be classified as pun, syntactic pattern, metaphor, proverb,
            and pseudo-logic, a classification that covers most of the devices which comic drama
            presented in witty dialogue. The simplest response displays the
            pun. For an example, see TLN 354–6.

        George Gascoigne’s Supposes (1566; pr. 1573),
          a source for Shr., has a commercial war like that between Ephesus
          and Syracuse. Marshall (in Irving, ed. 1888, 2:313) compares the two plays in his commentary on
            Shr., without a similar note for Err.:
            It seems as if in adapting or rewriting this play from the old Taming of A Shrew,
            Shakespeare had the Comedy of Errors sometimes in his mind. In Gascoigne’s Supposes, the
            penalty, which the Scenœse is supposed to encounter, by coming to
            Ferrara, was no more than confiscation of his goods.
          Mincoff (1973, p.
          556), arguing that Shr. is earlier than Err., lists the elements common to all three plays: An old man
            travelling to a foreign city is told that he has incurred the death penalty by entering
            enemy territory; the cause of the sudden hostilities in all three cases is quarrels over
            custom duties. Mincoff is wrong about the old man’s incurring the death penalty;
          Marshall is right.

        Bevington (1997,
          pp. 335 ff.) shows how thoroughly Err. mirrors the English
          theater of the late 1580s and early 1590s, not in using specific sources, but in shaping
          those sources to interests in romance (lost children, searching fathers),
            anglicizing moralization (p. 340), the suddenness and
            arbitrariness of falling into a complicated and sometimes guilty love
            relationship (p. 344), adapting rhetorical training at school into dialogue, and
          the like.

        The frame story of the shipwreck not only has its immediate source in Apollonius of Tyre but also reflects a more general influence of romantic tales
          that appealed to contemporary taste. Anders (1904, p. 107 and n.) suggests that Menaphon, the name
            (1855) of Solinus’s uncle, came from
          Greene’s romance Menaphon (1589), or possibly from Marlowe’s 1 Tamburlaine (printed
          1590); see n. 1855. Cuningham (ed. 1907,
          p. xxix) points out that a figure called Antiphilus . . . is one of the heroes in
            Sidney’s Arcadia. The word means mutual
            affection.
          Bullough (1957,
          1:9): In Sidney’s Arcadia Lib. 2 Antiphilus, beloved by
            Erona . . . , falls in love with someone else. When King he justifies polygamy and is
            slain by women. Perhaps Shakespeare was thinking ironically of this when he had to name
            his henpecked and not-very-faithful or affectionate Citizen.

        Starnes (1945, p.
          1022) thinks Apuleius’s Golden Ass lies behind the emphasis on
          witchcraft and sorcery in Err., elements that are not found in
            Menaechmi—though they do appear in Amphitruo, which Starnes does not deal with—and are behind Dromio’s fear that
          he has been transformed into an ass.

        Baldwin (1947,
          pp. 673–4): Shakspere could . . . hardly have been ignorant of either Marlowe’s or
            Greene’s Menaphon. And now appears a further significant fact. For in Greene’s Menaphon there is a shipwreck which parts the husband from the wife
            and infant son. Then pirates later steal the son from the wife. . . . [674] Here, I think, is certainly where Shakspere got his suggestion
            for parting the family bilaterally by shipwreck, and then later parting the mother from
            her son by marauders, and finally reuniting the family, in which Menaphon . . . is
            caused to play his part.

        Trenkner (1958,
          pp. 106–7) traces folk motifs in the Greek novella and subsequent literature. She
          discusses the prevalence of the lost twin brother story that is said to underlie Menaechmi and its sources: The chief adventure of the
            twin brothers, that is the mistake in identity made by the wife (and not the mistress as
            in the Menaechmi) is nearer to the folk-lore versions of the
            twins story in Shakespeare than it is in Plautus. Antipholus shrinks from her advances
            while Menaechmus has no scruples in responding to them.

        The doubling of the pair of twin brothers by the pair of twin servants is
            another innovation made by Shakespeare. This concept is usually said to have been lifted
            from the Amphitryo. . . . Yet the nature of the identical
            pairs and the ensuing complications are different in the two plots. She points
          out differences. (P. 107): But even if this scene [3.1] . . . is a
            reminiscence of the Amphitryo, the conception of two sets of
            twins cannot be derived from Plautus. Its obvious source is the folk-tale in which
            identical brothers are accompanied on their adventures by identical servants (dogs,
            horses, etc.). . . . 

        
          Shakespeare found the non-Plautine elements of the Comedy
              of Errors in current tales. By dovetailing these into Plautus’ plot, he
            returned to the primary source from which the Greek original of the Menaechmi is derived.
        

        Brooks (1961, pp. 64–5): Hence, when through his neo-Plautine
            warp Shakespeare ran a weft dyed in colours of romance, he was making no extreme change
            from the Latin genre as then frequently understood. Rather, he was overgoing Plautus,
            and Terence, on their supposed romantic side, as well as on that of comic intrigue. For
            this purpose, and for copiousness, he drew on additional sources. The
            leading interests of romance—as one might exemplify from Arthurian romances, from The Squire’s Tale, or, coming to the period of our play, from the
            romance aspects of Arcadia and The Faerie
              Queene—were adventure; marvel, especially enchantment; the high sentiment of
            love, and sens, the implications brought
            out in the matière, the meaning the
            reader takes away with him, as a result of the author’s treatment. Shakespeare develops
            into an adventure-story, that of Egeon, the successful quest for the long-lost child
            which in Menaechmi [65] is hardly more
            than a presupposition of the plot. For the initial peril demanded by a plot of this
            kind, he provides by translating from hoax into fact the situation of the Sienese
            merchant in Gascoigne’s Supposes where it was already part of a
            drama of mistaken identities; and by heightening it from a potential threat to goods
            into a provisional sentence of death. The shipwreck and intervention of piratical
            fishermen, whereby, Egeon narrates, the family was first divided, have a probable source
            in Greene’s Menaphon, and form a link with the source of the
            happy ending, the adventures of Apollonius of Tyre, related by Gower and Twine.
          He summarizes the relevant narrative in Apollonius.
          The interest of adventure is not confined to the dénouement and the opening scene; through the alien Antipholus
            it is carried into the main action. To him it seems that he has a series of adventures
            with the supernatural. His thoughts and feelings about them, like the providential
            coincidences that have brought all the members of the family to Ephesus, speak to our
            sense of marvel. His illusion of supernatural menace in these experiences is set against
            the real peril of Egeon, and against the truth of his love, even though his
            love-adventure, which brings the loftiest of love-sentiment into the comedy, seems to
            him supernatural and at least equivocally perilous too. In the idea of the town as a
            home of supernatural delusion, Shakespeare is again combining sources. The Epidamnum of
              Menaechmi (II.i) is notorious for cheats. The denizen’s house
            there is associated by Shakespeare with Amphitruo’s, a scene of supernatural
            shape-shifting. Epidamnum itself has changed to Ephesus, no doubt as the site of Diana’s
            Temple in the Apollonius story, which becomes his Abbey. Diana of the Ephesians
            inevitably recalls Acts XIX, whence Shakespeare would remember,
            besides the uproar on her account, the references to curious (that is, black) arts
            practised in Ephesus, and to the exorcists, with whom Dr. Pinch (founded on the Medicus
            in Menaechmi) has something in common. The Ephesians are warned
            against supernatural foes in St. Paul’s Epistle, which also exhorts them, Geoffrey
            Bullough reminds us, to domestic unity, dwelling on the right relationships of husbands
            and wives, parents and children, masters and servants. With the father’s rebuke to the
            wife in Menaechmi, and the long tradition of marital debate in
            mediaeval and Tudor literature, it thus contributed, no doubt, to the sens of the play.

        Smith (1966, p.
          21 n.) compares Adriana’s complaints about her husband’s neglect to Isabella’s in
          Marlowe’s Edward II. See n. 1643–6 for additional echoes of that play.

        For the possible influence of the Golden Legend on the Egeon
          story, see Salingar (1974) above.

        
        When Boswell (ed.
          1821) printed Malone’s extracts of the Revels accounts that Malone had perhaps intended
          to include in his History of the Stage, first published in ed.
          1790 and considerably expanded in ed. 1821, he offered to those commentators who want to
          find a lost source play (either because they doubt Sh.’s ability to read Latin or because
          they dislike the doggerel verse and other un-Shn. aspects of the play) a
          new bit of evidence. Malone (in Boswell, ed. 1821, 3:387) quotes the Revels accounts for the Christmas
          season of 1576–7: The Historie of Error, showen at Hampton court on New yeres daie
            at night; enacted by the children of Powles, and 4:151: It may be
            presumed that this ancient piece was in a good measure founded on the comedy of Plautus;
            and doubtless thus the fable was transmitted to Shakspeare. This play is
          lost.

        Malone also
          transcribes the following (3:406): A Historie of Ferrar, shewed before her Matie at Wyndesor, on Twelf daie at night, enacted by the Lord
            Chamberleyne’s servaunts, an entry for the 1582–3 season at court, more
          accurately printed by Albert Feuillerat, Documents Relating to the Office
            of Revels in the Time of Queen Elizabeth (Louvain, 1908, p. 350): A
            historie of fferrar shewed before her maiestie at wyndesor on
            Twelf daie at night Enacted by the Lord Chamberleynes servauntes
            furnished in this office with diverse new thinges As one Citty, one Battlement of canvas, iij Ells of sarcenet and .x. paire of
            gloves, and sondry other thinges in this office whereof some were
            translated for fitting of the persons &amp;c.

        This entry led to various guesses that this play, also lost, was a source for Err.
          Collier (1831,
          3:62–3): On new-year’s night 1576–7, the children of Paul’s acted The History of Error at Hampton Court. This fact is recorded by Malone, but
            he has not remarked also, that it was repeated on Twelfth-night, 1582–3; for although by
            mistake, in the account of the Revels at that date, it is called A
              History of Ferrar, the person who made out the list of
            plays, writing from the sound only [i.e., from dictation], meant probably the same piece
            as the History of Error. This play may have been the foundation
            of Shakespeare’s Comedy of Errors, and the circumstance, that
            he borrowed certain parts from the old History of Error, will
            explain all that the commentators have said regarding doggrel verses, and the apparent
            authorship of two different persons in the same play.

        A few years later, this hypothesis had hardened. Collier (ed. 1842, 2:109): The fact, no doubt,
            is that the clerk who prepared the account merely wrote the title by his ear. Thus we
            see that, shortly before Shakespeare is supposed to have come to London, a play was in
            course of performance upon which his own [Err.] might be
            founded. This astonishing fiction, based on a putative dictation, soon enters
          into the lore surrounding some antecedent version of Err., e.g.,
            Staunton (ed.
          1857, p. 111): The same [Revels] accounts contain an entry, under date of 1582–3,
            which may be assumed to refer to this play, although the title, through the ignorance or
            carelessness of the scribe, is misprinted, A Historie of Ferrar.

        Feuillerat (p. 469) objects to Collier’s inferences: He is somewhat bold in affirming that his
            own conjecture is not doubtful. The man who wrote the books [i.e., the Revels accounts],
            though he sometimes does make mistakes, was certainly not an unintelligent man (his
            spelling is consistent and not extravagant); and, from several errors already
            noticed . . . it is, on the contrary, most probable that he wrote by his copy and not
            by his ear. It is more simple and more natural to suppose that Ferrar may have been one of the principal dramatis personæ.

        One or both of these ur-Err.s is accepted
          as almost certainly some kind of textual half-way house between the drama of
            Plautus and that of Shakespeare (Wilson, ed. 1922, p. 74), by Ulrici (1839, tr. 1846, p. 260), Cuningham (ed. 1907,
          pp. xxiii f.), Erler (1913, pp. 18–19), and Robertson (1923, pp. 126–7). Chambers (1930, 1:308–9) seems to me
          correct: Nor can I attach much importance to the suggestion of an old text derived
            from the Paul’s court play of The historie of Error in 1577,
            perhaps through Sussex’s court play of A historie of fferrar in
            1583. We know nothing about these plays except their names. Obviously Paul’s might have
            adapted a Plautine play and called it Error. But there [309] are many kinds of error. They might also, for example, have
            produced a moral with Error as a character. A Paul’s play is not likely to have proved
            very suitable for Sussex’s men. . . . And Sussex’s fferrar looks to me
            very much like Ferrara. I see no reason to suppose that the Revels clerk
            made up his accounts from dictation. Certainly the scenery provided for the
          performance does not seem Plautine.
        

      





      
        Shakespeare’s MapSee map, 

        Egeon’s account of the shipwreck and its consequences, which separated him and S.
          Antipholus and S. Dromio from the others, returning the first group to Syracuse and
          fetching the other trio, now separated, up in Ephesus, offers geographical problems that
          cannot be straightened out. One can take Foakes’s (ed. 1962, p. xxx) position: There is no
            reason to demand geographical accuracy from a playwright who elsewhere gave Bohemia a
            sea-coast, and made a port of Milan. An audience is not likely to be troubled by
            inconsistencies of detail or inaccuracies in reference to distant and unfamiliar
            places. But Foakes goes on to summarize the issues, and so do I.

        Sh. changed the location of Err. from the Epidamnus of Plautus
          to Ephesus, and he decided to tell a shipwreck story to get everyone there. Furthermore,
          he particularizes the shipwreck by naming cities: Ephesus (20), Epidamium (45), Corinth (90), and Epidarus (96), all of which are real, not made-up names,
          locatable on one currently available map (Ortelius) and in Cooper’s (1565) Latin dictionary.
            (Epidamium is usually emended to Epidamnum, itself the
          accusative of Epidamnus, the form of the
          word on the map and in Cooper. Epidarus is Epidaurus.)

        The shipwreck is usually understood to have occurred in the Adriatic or rather the Ionian
          Sea east of Syracuse (a city on the southern coast of Sicily), somewhere close to the Gulf
          of Corinth. That locale presents the problem that Marshall (in Irving, ed. 1888, pp. 109–10) describes, commenting on
            96, Of Corinth
            that, of Epidarus this, referring to the two ships that
          tried to rescue the survivors clinging to the mast, soon to be split: This line
            seems to require a little geographical explanation. The Epidaurus . . . was . . . situate in Argolis on the Saronic Gulf [i.e., a little
            south of Corinth]. . . . Corinth had two ports, Lechæum on the Gulf of Corinth [i.e.,
            the western port] and Cenchreæ on the Saronic Gulf [the eastern port]. A ship, bound to
            or coming from the latter port, would come by the same course as one sailing to or from
            Epidaurus; and they would meet the floating mast . . . outside the Ionian Islands [on
            the western edge of the Gulf of Corinth]. . . . Ægeon tells us that the storm commenced
            when they were a league from Epidamium [65]; so that . . . the mast . . . must have travelled some
            considerable distance to have reached any spot near the entrance of that gulf.
          Epidamium (Epidamnus) is a city, now Durrës (also called Durazzo), in Albania, some 250
          miles north of the entrance to the gulf.

        To this long journey must be added the fact that there was another Epidaurus north of
          Epidamnus (now Dubrovnik in Croatia), so that one of the ships may have come from there,
          closing in from the north on the Corinthian ship coming up from the south.

        Sh. had available to him quite confusing information about this geography. Central to
            Baldwin’s
          studies of Sh.’s sources was his identification of Dionysius Lambinus’s 1577 edition of
          Plautus as the one Sh. used, along with Bishop Cooper’s Latin dictionary. If Sh. consulted both of
          these as Baldwin (ed. 1928, pp. 114–16; 1947, pp. 676–81) insists he did when he
          read the Menaechmi, he would have found the following
          information. Glossing Plautus’s Prologue, EPIDAMNVM DEVENIT,
          Lambinus says, Dyrrachium venit. Sed Steph. de
            vrbibus docet duas Epidamnos esse, vnã in Illyrico, alterã in sinu Ionio (He came to Dyrrachium [Durazzo]. But Stephanus in
            his On Cities teaches that there are two Epidamnuses, one in
            Illyria [Durazzo] and one on the Ionian gulf). But Cooper apparently describes
          only the latter Epidamnus as a towne in the southeweste parte of Greece on ye sea syde, called afterward Dyrrachiũ. The trouble is, there was no such Achaian Epidamnus. So Sh.
          learned that Epidamnus was either north in Illyria or southwest in Achaia.

        Of Epidaurus Cooper says, A citie in Greece in the coũtrey called Achaia, wherin
            was a famous tẽple dedicated vnto Aesculapius, to the which a great multitude of sicke
            people did resorte. And he says of Ephesus, A noble auncient citie in
            Asia the lesse. . . . In this citie was the famous temple of Diana, numbred among the
            .vii. wonders of the worlde. These entries in Cooper are on H3b–H3va of an appendix, Dictionarium
          Historicum, making browsing easy.

        After the separated families are picked up, Egeon and his lot return to Syracuse on the
          east coast of Sicily, and Æmilia and her lot, at first picked up by men of Epidamium (1841), then separated by rude Fishermen of Corinth (1843), made their way
          eventually to Ephesus; Æmilia was left with those of Epidamium (1845), i.e.,
          presumably Epidamnus, so how she got to Ephesus is hard to imagine if the shipwreck
          occurred in the Adriatic, or Ionian, Sea.

        This is the position originally taken by Baldwin (ed. 1928, pp. 118–19): Now the
            circumstances of the shipwreck are apparently impossible geographically. For these
            people, wrecked only three miles from Epidamnum [he is using the form Pope substituted for
            Epidamium], start drifting directly for Corinth, some four hundred miles away. Not only
            do they have a four-hundred-mile objective, but they have a physical impossibility,
            since their direct course would force them to float overland. This float
            [across the isthmus to Corinth] [119] would appear even more
            impossible in old maps than actually it was. Too, the scattering family is taken up by
            fishermen of Corinth and vessels from Epidaurus and Epidamnum. Evidently Shakespeare
            thinks of Epidamnum as being near Corinth and Epidaurus, seemingly near the western end
            of the Gulf of Corinth. This impossibility leads him to a fantasy of imagining a
          first version of Err. that would take place in Plautus’s
          Epidamnus, and a second that shifts events to Ephesus with Sh. not noticing the
          inconsistencies the shift occasioned. He withdrew the theory in On Act
            and Scene Division (1965, p. 149).

        Baldwin
          judges that Sh. had no map that would help him visualize Egeon’s tale; instead, Sh. relied
          on Lambinus, Cooper, and Acts 19:19, which helped him decide
          on Ephesus as the right setting for Err.
          Parks (1940)
          proposes just such a map, one showing Saint Paul’s journeys, in Abraham Ortelius’s Theatrum orbis terrarum (1570 and later; see Foakes, ed. 1962, Frontispiece; map,  of this edition, and n. 1841–7). Parks shows flaws in Baldwin’s no-map argument (p.
          94): These books are in fact insufficient. In the former [Lambinus], Epidamnus is
            of course identified, but no other names would naturally be suggested in connection with
            a play confined to that city. In the latter [Cooper], Epidamnus is also given, and
            Ephesus preceding it; but the Epidaurus given is the more famous one on the east coast
            of Greece, not the one Shakespeare had in mind. All that either book could have given
            would be the identification of Epidamnus. Neither would of itself have suggested the use
            of Ephesus. Parks barely hints that Sh. probably chose Ephesus for reasons that
          had nothing to do with maps or dictionaries.

        In Ortelius, Sh. would have found all four E-name cities listed in the (p. 95) Nomina . . . Antiqua: The Epidaurus is moreover the right one,
            in Illyria, and it is defined in such a fashion as to stick in the memory. That is, it
            is identified as the modern Ragusa [Dubrovnik], a city well known in England as a vassal
            state of the Turk and the home of the argosy or Ragusan ship. On the map all the
          cities necessary are prominently named save for the nearly invisible Ephesus, just to the
          right of the isle of Samos in the Aegean sea.

        Parks admits he
          cannot prove that Sh. consulted this map, but he argues that it was available and was (p.
          97) the leading atlas of its time.
          Baldwin (1947, p.
          689 n.) rejects Parks on the grounds that Sh. is not known to have seen Ortelius’s
          map.

        Baldwin (Genetics, 1965, pp. 147 ff.) thinks the wreck took place in the
          Aegean, and he invents a town in Asia Minor called Epidamium located somewhere close to
          Ephesus. This is a breathtaking solution once one gets past the boldness and the (usual)
          opacity and incompleteness of the explanation. It depends, though he never says so, on the
          phrase from Stephanus locating a second Epidaurus in sinu Ionio. This phrase, normally understood as
            on the Ionian gulf, Baldwin silently takes to mean, as it can, in
            the winding coast of Ionia,
          a dist[rict] in the W[est] coast of Asia Minor, extending from Phocæa to
            Miletus, an area that includes Ephesus (Sugden [1925, s.v. Ionia], quoting
            Ant. 1.2.107 [191], And to
            Ionia). It also depends on emphasizing the Asia Minor setting of the play,
          especially Fiue Sommers haue I spent in farthest Greece,
            Roming cleane through the bounds of Asia, And coasting homeward,
            came to Ephesus (135–7), where Sh. is following Plautus closely but
          misunderstanding Graeciamque exoticam, the Greek settlements
          in southern Italy (see n. 135–7).

        In this work, too, Baldwin gives Sh. a map, one attached to Acts in the Bishops’ Bible
          (1573) that labels the cities Paul visited on his missionary journeys. (P. 147):
            Now [referring to his chapter 9 where he explains the Asian setting] that we have
            located farthest Greece, the genetics of the
            geography of Errors becomes clear. Ephesus and Epidamium are
            close together in Ionia. Corinth and Syracuse occupy their actual positions, as does
            Ephesus. We have left only Epidaurus, which comes into Errors
            with Corinth. Neither Epidamnus nor Epidaurus is on the biblical map, since they are not
            mentioned in the Bible story.

        The only possible Epidaurus for Sh. is the one near Corinth, since (p. 148)
            this . . . is the only one known to Cooper, and the only one really known in
            Shakspere’s day. . . . [149] Shakspere’s Epidamium was not in
            Illyricum but alongside Ephesus in Ionia, farthest Greece,
            Greece of Asia. I have not omitted any part of his argument that
          Sh. invented this Epidamium—which after all is a made-up word somehow based on Epidamnum.
            This location makes plain sailing of Aegeon’s shipwreck
            and the sequent wanderings of the family. In Menaechmi, the
            merchant who stole the twin was of Epidamnus. Being alongside the commercial Ephesus in
            Ionia of Asia, Epidamium was thus a natural place for Aegeon (made a merchant as was the
            father of the twins in Menaechmi) to establish a foreign
            business. In a straight line with each other on the biblical map attached to Acts are
            Siracusa, the place of departure in Menaechmi and retained in
              Errors, Corīthus [he uses the orthography of the map], and
              Ephesus. . . . The map would indicate a straight route from
            Syracuse to Ephesus, with only a slight neck of land to negotiate at Corinth, and this
            map would be compulsorily available along with the story for grammar school boys of
            Shakspere’s day. . . . 

        The location of Epidamnus in sinu
              Ionio by Stephanus and Lambinus had placed for Shakspere Epidamium in
            Ionia . . . alongside Ephesus. Sailing from this nonexistent Epidamium . . . on the
            Aegean Sea was not [150] lightly to be undertaken. Here
          he recounts ancient warnings about the danger of sailing the Aegean. Most important,
          having the wreck north of Corinth on the Aegean makes sense of And floating
            straight, obedient to the streame, Was carried towards Corinth,
            as we thought (89–90; see n. 89 [straight] there, where the streame is identified as a
          well-known current falling out of the Black Sea southwest into the Aegean), whereas a
          wreck on the Adriatic causes the difficulties already noted. Baldwin must think that
            Epidamium was somewhat north of Ephesus, which on the maps of Ortelius
          and the Bishops’ Bible itself seems to be a bit north of Corinth across the Aegean, though
          in fact it is a bit south.

        The only notice Baldwin gives that he has completely changed his mind about in sinu Ionio is (p. 149): Since these locations are
            derived directly, it is not necessary to review the discussions of Epidamnus in
            Illyricum, to which, following the excellent lead of Irving and Marshall, I have
            contributed my share, a wry glance at his 1928 edition. No edition to date has
          incorporated Baldwin’s bold invention of this nonexistent Epidamium.

      

    







    
      Criticism




      
        General Comments and Assessments

        Gildon (1710,
          7:299): Allowing for the Puns which were the Vice of the Age he liv’d in, it is
            extremely diverting; the Incidents are wonderfully pleasant, and the Catastrophe very happy and strongly moving.

        Gentleman
          (ed. 1774, p. 81): The Comedy of Errors does not very
            obviously produce a moral, but we may deduce from it, that Providence can happily
            regulate the most perplexed and unpromising circumstances, and change a temporary
            apparent evil, into a real and lasting good. Patience and submission are herein justly
            and properly inculcated.

        Griffith (1775,
          p. 144) approvingly collects the highly moralistic passages, e.g.,
          remarking on 755–67:
            There is a sentiment of great propriety and delicacy argued upon; in the
            dissuading a person from the commission of an unseemly action, even though the thing
            itself might be sufficiently justified in one’s own breast. A respect to decency, and
            the opinion of the world, is an excellent bulwark to our virtues.

        Pütz (1970, p.
          171): In a letter to Goethe, 25 Apr. 1797, Schiller praises Err.
          as the best example of an exposition that is already part of the development of the
          play.

        Schlegel (1809–11, tr. 1815, 2:158): Once we grant the first twinning,
          the second is acceptable (we shall not perhaps be disposed to cavil at the
            second); because the senses must be appealed to, masks were surely used to make
          up for the lack of truth; I cannot acquiesce in the censure that the discovery is
            too long deferred; so long as novelty and interest are possessed by the perplexing
            incidents, there is no need to be in dread of wearisomeness; in such plots you
          cannot get away from some lowness, but Sh. has however endeavoured to ennoble it in
            every possible way. A couple of scenes, dedicated to jealousy and love, interrupt the
            course of perplexities which are solely occasioned by the illusion of the external
            senses; Egeon’s exposition expertly informs the spectators of what the
          characters do not know. In short, this is perhaps the best of all written or
            possible Menæchmi; and if the piece be inferior in worth to other pieces of Shakspeare,
            it is merely because nothing more could be made of the materials.

        Some early critics object to the premise of perfect twinness that Schlegel solves by the use of masks:
            Bräker (1780,
          tr. 1979, p. 51), Duport (1828, 1:266), Eckhardt (1928, p. 159). Guizot (1821, 3:215) agrees with
          Schlegel.

        Daniel (ed.
          1827, pp. 5–6): In . . . the Comedy of
              Errors, there is Shakspeare in every scene: not in all the plenitude of his
            ripened genius, but certainly giving promise of those wonderful powers that were to
            render his name celebrated to the end of time.

        Of Inchbald
          (below) (p.6): Mrs. Inchbald is never more at fault than when she remarks on the
            Writings of Shakspeare, which we firmly believe, like most of her predecessors, she
            never studied beyond the part assigned to her on the stage. If the drama is to be judged
            by the rules of probability, very many of it’s [sic] noblest productions shall not
            escape censure. . . . But the author’s intention was to excite mirth, which he has done
            in a very extraordinary degree.

        Sievers (1866)
          offers a positive critique of the power of the human spirit to overcome human impotence in
          the face of irresistible nature and defective perception.

        Naturally, there are those who do not like The Comedy of Errors.
            Gerstenberg
          (1766; 1937, pp. 66–7): In a mock dialogue with a Romantic enthusiast who exclaims
          excitedly about the overflowing abundance of Sh.’s genius that makes one fear one will be
          unable to grasp it all, the other speaker, lamenting that nature deprived him of such
          declamatory power, scorns the undisciplined, unclassical play.

        For Steevens’s
          (ed. 1793, p. 316) dislike of the play, see n. 1918.

        Inchbald (ed. 1808, pp. 3–4) agrees with Steevens that Sh. touched only a little
          of someone else’s play: Of all improbable stories, this is the most so. . . . [4] Its fable verges on impossibility, but the incidents which arise
            from it could never have occurred. She grants that Sh. wrote Ægeon’s narrative
          in 1.1 and the Abbess’s speeches in 5, though not even in these parts are there any
            very powerful marks of his genius.

        Hazlitt (1817; 1930, 4:351–2): Shakespear appears to have
            bestowed no great pains on it [Err.], and there are but a few
            passages which bear the decided stamp of his genius. He seems to have relied on his
            author [Plautus], and on the interest arising out of the intricacy of the plot. The
            curiosity excited is certainly very considerable, though not of the most pleasing
            kind. . . . In reading the play, from the sameness of the names of the two Antipholises
            and the two Dromios, as well from their being constantly taken for each other by those
            who see them, it is difficult, without a painful effort of attention, to keep the
            characters distinct in the mind. And again, on the stage, either the complete similarity
            of their persons and dress must produce the same perplexity whenever they first enter,
            or the identity of appearance which the story supposes, will be destroyed. We still,
            however, having a clue to the difficulty, can tell which is which, merely from the
            practical contradictions which arise, as soon as the different parties begin to speak;
            and we are indemnified for the perplexity and blunders into which we are thrown by
            seeing others thrown into greater and almost inextricable ones.—This play . . . leads
            us not to feel much regret that Shakespear was not what is called a classical scholar.
            We do not think his forte would ever have lain in imitating or
            improving on what others invented, so much as in inventing for himself. . . . [352]—The only passage of a very Shakespearian cast . . . is the
            one in which the Abbess, with admirable characteristic artifice, makes Adriana confess
            her own misconduct in driving her husband mad. [Quotes 1511–59.]

        Kenny (1864, p.
          168) dismisses Err. as too slight, too farcical for the
            exercise of the finer qualities of his genius.

        
        Van Doren (1939,
          pp. 44–5): In comedies of situation, Sh. confines his interest, or almost confines
            it, to physical predicament—to things that happen to certain persons not because of who
            they are but because of what they are. . . . [The four twins] exist for no other
            purpose than to be mutually mistaken. They may groan and seem to go mad in their
            perplexity, but we only laugh the louder; for it is the figure that gestures, not the
            man, and our expectation indeed is that the playwright will strain his ingenuity still
            further in the invention of new tortures, provided new ones are possible. . . . If
            Shakespeare’s spirit reposed in comedy it was not in this kind of comedy. He could write
            it very well and be hugely funny; but the heart of his interest was elsewhere, and the
            poet had abdicated.

        This being the case, he says, the poet . . . puffs with unnatural effort
          in 1792–6, the rhymes (p.45) rattle like bleached bones, the long verse
          speeches are stiff and prim and explicit, the beginning of 2.2 is
            among the dullest things of its kind in Shakespeare. Some decent lines
          and characterizations look ahead to better work.
        

        Sen Gupta (1950,
          p. 105): The source material is not congenial to Sh.’s genius; his greatness
            consists primarily in fathoming the depths of the human mind and only secondarily in
            enriching his plot with multiplicity of incidents.

        Cazamian (1952,
          p. 194) finds the mistaken identity theme worn out, the laughs cheaply got.
            But . . . the convention here is handled in a humorous way because it does not
            appeal wholeheartedly to our acceptance. It is quite willing that no one should take it
            very seriously. We can almost see the playwright’s tongue in his cheek. One intimation
            of this confessed unreality . . . is that the characters are more or less aware of it.
            Their reactions when faced with the painful or ridiculous consequences to themselves of
            an absurd imbroglio are not quite those of flesh-and-blood people under the shrewd or
            humiliating blows of fortune; they grow most amusing when most persecuted by
            fate. . . . But it is plain . . . that everybody is out to make the huge joke a
            success. We are the more inclined to think so, as the playwright, who after all pulls
            the wires, displays such genuine knowledge of human nature, moves his puppets with so
            much unfeigned liveliness, keeping the interplay of temperaments and the animation of
            dialogue at such high pitch. How superior he is to his own subject! . . . A pleasant,
            though not deep, comedy of character is thus founded on a basis which our instinct knows
            to be unsafe, but which no one minds as the author does not really try to pass it off
            upon us under false pretenses.
          Tetzeli von
            Rosador (ed. 1982, pp. 26–9) surveys criticism of Err. from Coleridge through the mid-1970s, concluding that there is at best a
          partial consensus, and at worst, no consensus about sources, genre, and themes—a state of
          affairs that is unusual in Sh. studies.

        Genre





        
          Farce

          The question of the extent to which Err. is simply farce
            without the additional enrichment of character that produces comedy gets its most
            articulate beginnings with Coleridge (1836, 2:114–15): The myriad-minded man, our, and all
              men’s, Shakspeare, has in this piece presented us with a legitimate farce in exactest
              consonance with the philosophical principles and character of farce, as distinguished
              from comedy and from entertainments. A proper farce is mainly distinguished from
              comedy by the license allowed, and even required, in the fable, in order to produce
              strange and laughable situations. The story need not be probable, it is enough that it
              is possible. A comedy would scarcely allow even the two Antipholises; because,
              although there have been instances of [115] almost
              indistinguishable likeness in two persons, yet these are mere individual accidents,
                casus ludentis naturæ [accidents of
              playful nature], and the verum [truth]
              will not excuse the inverisimile
              [improbability]. But farce dares add the two Dromios, and is justified in so doing by
              the laws of its end and constitution. In a word, farces commence in a postulate, which
              must be granted.

          Dowden (1877;
            1882, pp. 65–7) slightly modifies but does not dispute Coleridge’s view: The Comedy of Errors is Shakspere’s one farcical play. Its sources
              of laughter lie almost wholly in the situations and incidents, hardly at all in the
                charac­[66]ters. The spectator of the play is called on
              to accept much that is improbable . . . for the sake of mere fun and
              laughter-stirring surprises. So cleverly, however, are the incidents and persons
              entangled and disentangled, so rapidly does surprise follow surprise, that we are
              given no time to raise difficulties and offer objections. . . . [67] To Shakspere belongs wholly the serious background, from which the
              farcical incidents stand out in relief. . . . There is a fine passage, full of
              pathos, and almost in Shakspere’s later dramatic manner, where the old man, a prisoner
              before the duke, finds that his son does not recognise his face, nor remember his
              voice [1775–1803];
              but such passages, in which character or human passion rather than incident chiefly
              interests us, are rare.

          Coleridge’s
            distinction will not do for Quiller-Couch (in Wilson, ed. 1922, pp. xxi f.): With all respect to
              Coleridge [above] we say that this has the air of special pleading; and we distrust it
              the more because of its categorizing farce apart from comedy and giving it laws
                of its end and constitution. As a matter of history, and even of
              nomenclature, farce and comedy never have been and never can be divided into
              compartments with separate literary laws. . . . Who ever made these categories or
              gave them laws? . . . There is no line of demarcation—all such lines,
              or attempts at them, are a professional humbug of criticism. In literature it is all a
              question of tact. The author persuades us into the right mood. . . . We see no point
              at all in praising the Errors above the Menaechmi as the high water mark of elaborate farce in its highest
                signification. It might (though we doubt it) have come near to deserve such
              praise had Shakespeare not set his artificial farce between the romantic-realism of
              the distressed merchant . . . and of the long-lost wife reclaimed. . . . We should
              prefer to say that in this early play Shakespeare already discloses his propensity for
              infusing [xxii] romance into each or every form
              of drama; that unique propensity which in his later work makes him so magical and hard
              to define. But, as yet, farce and romance were not one form but two
              separate stools; and between them in The Comedy of Errors he
              fell to the ground. We should add, however, that we have never seen it on the boards,
              for it is seldom staged. There is some evidence that it acts
              well—which, after all, is the test—and even that it provokes uproarious
              mirth.

          Chambers (1926,
            pp. 25–30) takes a middle ground. It is true that there is some interest in the
              ethical problems which hinge upon jealousy and that it is comedy in the
              true sense of a criticism of life, which is at heart profoundly serious, and employs
              all the machinery of wit or humour, with the deliberate intention of reaching through
              the laughter to the ultimate end of a [26] purged outlook upon
              things. Let an audience shake its sides at the plight into which a scold is brought by
              the railings of her tongue, and it is odds that they will go away with the conviction
              that the wiser course is not to rail. . . . From one point of view, then, The Comedy of Errors is to be classed as a comedy. But if
            you strip the play of its ornaments of the romance plot and the ethics of
            jealousy, the interest declares itself as almost entirely one of plot. He
            then distinguishes two senses of farce, one merely a variety of comedy which, despite
            its roughness, still is interested in character, the second being one in which (p. 28)
              the interest of character is wholly replaced by an interest of plot. The
              conception of farce in this sense may be defined as the deduction of a logical
              conclusion from absurd premises. The playwright starts with some impossible
              assumption, which you must take for granted; however unconvincing, however grotesque,
              it is beyond your criticism. From this he proceeds, without any further breach of the
              probabilities, to show what follows, and to work out a resulting tissue of
              absurdities, all inherent in the initial situation.
            Shr. and Wiv. belong to the first
            kind, Err. to the second, though there is a (p. 29)
              qualification, namely that although the Ephesian twins do not know they
            have identical looking brothers, the Syracusan twins must have been told by Egeon of the
            fact, hence it is almost incredible that, when they found themselves being
              obviously and constantly mistaken at Ephesus for persons not themselves, the solution
              of the puzzle should have failed to suggest itself to them. Likewise Egeon
            should have figured out why he was repudiated by someone looking like his Syracusan son.
              There are therefore . . . two assumptions, not one, made in the play; an
              assumption of physical [30] resemblance so close as to be
              mistaken for identity, and an assumption also of a very singular kind of oblivion in
              at least two of the personages. Against the second assumption we are
              entitled to protest.

          Brooks (1961,
            p. 70): Dynamic progress is strongly felt in the mounting violence, from the
              first mere thwack to the drawing of swords, thrashing with a rope’s end, overpowering
              of madmen, and elaborate (narrated) vengeance upon Pinch; in the
              spreading of error beyond the family to courtesan, goldsmith, and merchant, until the
              whole town, at least in Adriana’s fevered fancy, seems involved; and in the darkening
              conviction of the imaginative Antipholus that his supernatural experiences are from
              the devil. With this explanation, natural to his melancholy temperament, he has
              positively encased himself in error, for it is as coherent as it is fallacious. In
              like fashion his choleric brother comes to attribute all his sufferings to a
              conspiracy instigated by his wife: both the Antipholi reach the verge of
              persecution-mania. Since Adriana also is given her point of view, which alters before
              the end, one can say of the three main persons that although they do not develop in
              the sense of being felt to change in character as a result of the action, their
              attitudes of mind develop, so that each is felt to have an inner self. That is, they
              are not wholly flat characters, such as might be fitting protagonists of pure farce.
              They are simple, but have just enough depth for the play, which Shakespeare, as we
              have seen, has deepened considerably beyond the expected limitations of neo-classical
              comedy.

          Levin (1964, p.
            43): We are at the roulette table, not the chessboard, here. There is no plotting
              or counter-plotting in a Machiavellian sense. The sole plotter is the playwright, and
              whatever that ingenious trickster hatches is fobbed off on us as a trick of fate, a
              practical joke on the part of providence. For here the mistaken identity is not
              deliberately cultivated through impersonation or disguise . . . ; it is a freak of
              nature, lusus naturae, which Coleridge
              advises us to accept as a postulate. And Coleridge philosophizes . . . about farce,
              distinguishing between it and proper comedy as the basis for a distinction between the
              possible and the probable. A set of identical twins, leading different lives,
              constitutes an improbable possibility. The distinction is sometimes drawn in terms of
              character and plot: farce tends to subordinate the former to the latter.

          Sh.’s doubling of the twins presses the limits of possibility. If that was a
              reduction to absurdity, absurdity is man’s lot as the Existentialists have redefined
              it, and what should a farce be if not wholly absurd?

          Berry (1972, p.
            25): It [Err.] is in fact two plays, a farce and a
              comedy, most expertly synthesized. Farce, essentially mechanistic, requires that we
              look on all of the dramatis personae from outside. . . . But Shakespeare presents
              characters from the inside, that is to say he depicts people who have stumbled into
              the world of farce and do not understand its laws. The farce play here is merely the
              record of the mechanical errors based on mistaken identity. The comedy is the study of
              the reactions of the characters to the farce in which they find
              themselves. . . . There are . . . two major objections to terming The Comedy of Errors a farce; the frame to the action, pregnant with
              tragedy, and the fact that the characters consistently refuse to be
              mechanized.

          Turner (1974,
            pp. 166–7, 177): Recent critics . . . make much of Antipholus’s
              declaration of love and connect it with Egeon’s sentence of death, the addition of
              Emilia, Antipholus of Syracuse’s soliloquies on identity, and the family reunion to
              show how Shakespeare deepened his source play. Implicit in their
              argument is an understanding of farce as some lesser form in a hierarchy of genres,
              inappropriate to Shakespeare’s genius; so they set out to show how even his first
              comedy goes beyond the limitations of farce by adding such topics as
                death,
              love, or identity that have special value in
              themselves. . . . If indeed themes can have value apart from the way they are
              dramatized, one might respond that in this play the experiences of love and marriage
              serve to develop the theme of what constitutes identity. Had Shakespeare intended to
              develop such an ideal relationship between man and woman, he missed his chance in Act
              V, where Luciana and Antipholus of Syracuse could have expressed their sentiments. Yet
              they remain completely silent. . . . [167] I question whether
              the farce is to be praised because of its serious issues. Surely the
              problem for analysis is to show how Shakespeare puts such topics to comic
              uses. . . . Isn’t it the very power of farce to transmute potential threats and
                serious themes to matters for laughter and joy? Shakespeare appears
              to be testing the power of his story by the very lengths to which he adds what would
              otherwise be serious. Rather than separate the comic
                intrigue and comic rhetoric from the themes, we should ask
              how it is that themes, quite serious in other contexts, become the stuff of
              farce.

          
            The neo-classical principles of sixteenth-century humanists cannot
              satisfy all our questions about the dynamics of comic attitudes, but they can prevent
              us from overemphasis on sentiments of love or sympathy for a condemned father, a
              misunderstood wife, or a beaten servant. . . . Farce affords its distinctive
              pleasures that arise from its very limitations. It has the power to make us laugh at
              cuckolds, shrews, beaten servants, unpaid goldsmiths, unjust laws, even potential
              incest. Shakespeare did indeed change and add to his source play, but to make it more
              the kind of drama that it is, not to romanticize or soften it. . . . 
          

          [177] Much of the low comic behavior arising
              from the improprieties of master and servant is slapstick. The brothers Antipholi are
              harsh masters, irritable to the point of beating their servants. . . . The
              Dromios . . . as best they can, carry out the offices of servant, and strangely it is
              because they are unjustly punished that we laugh. . . . We laugh not because we
              experience a surprise but because we are forced to acknowledge an unpleasant fact that
              we would rather ignore, that some human beings are victimized regardless of their good
              nature.

          Gurewitch
            (1975, pp. 84 ff.) says that comedy usually searches for truth: It is surely
              noble to argue that comedy is a mode of combating the tendency of the human mind to
              harbor faulty knowledge. Nevertheless, the comedy of truth is not all the truth about
              comedy. Undeniably, the ends of comedy are often served by a quest for clarification
              and wisdom; and this quest may reasonably be considered the analogue of a series of
              laboratory experiments. But a razor-edged awareness of the illogical stresses and
              strains in human thought and conduct is not the whole preoccupation of comic energy.
              Whereas satiric comedy . . . delights in the laughing murder of untenable ideas,
              ironic comedy treats ideas only as colorful or [85] intriguing
              toys. Farcical comedy is more devastating: it promotes a subversion of mind itself by
              seeking out the powerful pleasures of irrationality. And humorous comedy not only
              tolerates man’s proneness to make mistakes, but even cherishes his fallible biases and
              pieties.

          (P. 89): Sh. does not forsake the privileges of nonsense bequeathed to
              him by Plautus. . . . The two irrationalities (lunatic misidentification and romantic
              passion) harmonize in The Comedy of Errors largely because
              disparate aggressors against reason tend to become partners willy-nilly, [90] one incredibility helping to beget
            another. . . . 

          
            The extraordinary family reunion . . . when father, mother, twin sons,
              and twin servants are all recovered, is a soothing fantasticality but also a weak one
              (getting rid of the elations of incoherence at the end of a comedy of errors is always
              a letdown).
          

          He offers a critique of Levin above. (P. 91): But Levin is tempted to
              transform the whirligig of chance into more drastic and more modern comic mischief;
              and in his analysis of The Comedy of Errors he finally
              embraces both the metaphysics (not just the presence) of contingency and the madness
              of farce. Paying homage to Shakespeare’s daring in presenting the absurdity of two
              sets of twins, Levin suggests that there is really nothing astounding here:
                Absurdity is man’s lot as the Existentialists have redefined it, and what
                should a farce be if not wholly absurd? . . . 

          
            But . . . a wholly absurd farce would contain impieties
              and outrages that are nonexistent in The Comedy of Errors.
              Shakespeare’s farce is a delightfully tricky dislocation of logic and sense, but in
              other respects it is a small solvent for psychic repression. Levin’s metaphor of the
              roulette table suggests well enough that the nonsense in Shakespeare’s comedy has its
              boundaries: it leaps about within a patterned chanciness and a comparatively polite
              ambience. It [92] is no step toward nihilism and no summons to
              festive riot. Thus The Comedy of Errors does not exemplify
              Levin’s assertion that the carnival spirit is the first
                condition of comedy, comedy itself being a release from the rules, a
                dispensation from the routine duties of existence. . . . The Comedy of Errors may break the rules of inference, but it does not open
              the floodgates of carnival. . . . 
          

          
            In Shakespeare’s comedy of ignorance, error arises chiefly from optical
              illusion, not from ethical delusion.
          

          Hunter (1986,
            pp. 28 ff.) defines farce, comedy, and romance in quasi-Aristotelian terms, describing
              certain recurrent formal elements . . . using only the standard vocabulary of
              formal play description such as even the playwrights of the sixteenth century could
              have recognized, namely ethos to mean set of
              beliefs or value system, and muthos to mean plot
            (p. 30).

          The coexistence of ethos and muthos can provide a formal matrix not only for
              that kind of play in which the valued man sets himself against society but also for
              that in which the valued society succeeds in taming or expelling the irritant or
              objectionable individual.
            Hamlet illustrates the first, comedy the second.

          (P. 31): In the mode of farce the individual cannot
              exercise ethical choice [i.e., the ability to choose a set of beliefs
              or value system] but must intrigue continuously just to
              survive. . . . 

          [33] The effect of such farcical structures on
              Shakespearian comedy is not hard to discover. In the Shakespeare comedies that are
              closest to the farce mode—The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, The Merry Wives of
                Windsor—we see marked structural similarities linking one play with
              another. . . . All three plays show their central characters—the Antipholi, Kate,
              Falstaff—hounded by plots that, moving fast and furious, force them to run just as
              fast. The worlds they are found in demand that they accept an ethos that they barely
              understand and that they would rather exploit than accept. Their careers are marked by
              a series of attempts to impose themselves on an environment that can only regard them
              as aberrant. And being aberrant they are too weak to succeed in their impositions. One
              is a puzzled foreigner. . . . Energy, willfulness, determination to keep on moving,
              may allow the protagonist to win the occasional battle, but he or she is bound to lose
              the war, for all the eventual advantages lie with the social body. . . . [34] In The Comedy of Errors each
              discovery by an Antipholus that the world is alien is complemented by an assurance
              that it is familiar and welcoming. . . . The unceasing and manic energy of farce in
              these plays comes from the central characters’ unrelenting determination to reject
              complicity with the world around them. But we can see well enough that complicity is
              the only fate available. The unity of the play’s world demands that the opponents
              finally admit that they belong to one another. Antipholus of Ephesus rejects with a
              torrent of vituperation the kindly-meant diagnosis of Doctor Pinch, wife, and
              neighbors; but the community is not put off by his rejection. They think of his
                madness as simply the deprivation of their normality,
              their efforts being bent entirely toward what they see (properly enough) as his
              recovery of full status as a healthy and accepting member of society.

          
            The plots of these plays are generated out of the opposition between
              individual self-assertion and the ethos of a coherent social group. . . . In The Comedy of Errors the opposition between the mercantile world
              of Ephesus and the merchants from Syracusa turns out to be only an error.
          

          McDonald (1988,
            pp. 77–8, 81) asserts that farce is a worthy genre, and critics ought not to try to make
            serious what is funny: For many years the earliest comedies were treated
              unapologetically as farces and Shakespeare was praised, if mildly, for his skill at
              contriving such brilliant and pleasing trifles.

          But in the last three or four decades he has been rehabilitated. McDonald proposes to (p. 78)
              argue that Shakespeare’s taste was not invariably elevated. He does so
            in the interest of canonicity, to avoid deforming Err. to make
            it conform to a more elevated state, and by embracing farce he thus adds to Sh.’s
            range.

          He surveys the evasions that critics have devised for treating Shakespeare’s
              efforts in farce, with concentration on the dodges applied to Errors. This he does usefully, granting in footnotes that such
            criticism often has broadened our understanding of the play.

          His own straightforward study of the play’s theatrical action proposes to
              identify the playwright’s strategies for the production of meaning in farce.
            His analysis does not look very different from others that show artful complexity at
            work, except that he usually emphasizes that all the artfulness is designed to produce
            laughs, not some deeper and therefore more acceptable emotions.

          (P. 81): To a great extent, the comedy of Errors arises
              from the number of barriers Shakespeare has erected to thwart the normal
            movement in comedy to reconciliation. The greatest obstacles arise in the
              principal characters’ relations with their servants, in the arena of commerce, and in
              the realm of speech itself. Shakespeare generates amusing conflict by exaggerating the
              forces that separate people and by weakening the media that connect them.

          Mackenzie
            (1924, p. 26), Crump (1925, pp. 27–8), Hubler (1964, p. 60), Swinden (1973, pp. 25–6), Charney (1978),
              Heilman (1979,
            1982), and Scott
            (1982, p. 2) also deal with farce.

        





        
          Comedy

          Wilson (1953,
            pp. 119–20): Already in his youth Shakespeare moved in a world in which Marlowe
              was not at home and showed no signs of ever wishing to be at home. The comedy is
              middle-class and Plautine and farcical, and so uncharacteristic of Shakespeare: for
              the earliest play that really shows us the shape of Shakespearian comedy to come is
                The Two Gentlemen. But already in The
                Comedy of Errors there is the sense of fun without reference to the
              correction of manners, the fun of a man who in certain moods finds the vagaries of
              human nature and human life a theme for amused and sympathetic comment. In the grief
              of the jealous wife Adriana, which breaks the bonds of the Plautine convention, there
              is more than a hint that to this dramatist comedy is to be not merely comedy of
              humours or manners, but profound comedy, and that women are to play as [120] prominent a part in it as men. We shall not expect to find,
              in this middle-class setting, in this whirl of mistaken identity, examples of the
              conversation of men and women of good breeding, of the exquisite social tact which by
              nature or nurture was at [his] command; . . . yet am I being merely fanciful in
              seeing anticipations of this gracious world of courtesy and civility in such a chance
              phrase as: Sir, I commend you to your own content [195]. In all this Marlowe had no share.

          Nicoll (1962,
            pp. 134–5) opposes a too-narrow definition of comedy, stressing that the invention of
            Egeon is more important than that of Luciana: The timelessness and
              placelessness of the Shakespearian comedy find their appropriate background in the
              arousing of an atmosphere which continually hovers between life’s phenomena and the
              phantasmagoria of the dream—the one inextricably mingled with the other. [135] Throughout the plays, from the earliest to the latest, we
              can trace this. We start with the queries in The Comedy of
                Errors: What, was I married to her in my dream? Or sleep I
                now? [577–8] and If this be not a dream I see and hear [1864]. . . . 

          
            Inevitably, all of this means that the characters in Shakespearian
              comedy assume a form utterly different from those in the other types of comedy. Even
              although the persons are ordinary and appear before us in a crowd, the play of humour,
              associated with the other elements dependent upon it, offers us the illusion of a
              living quality in its very strangeness.
          

          Bryant (1965,
            p. 7) calls Err. among other early comedies a
              rational play (comedies are rational, tragedies
              non-rational, but each is mixed with the other). Sh. places more
            emphasis on women than Plautus would allow, fostering the nonrational knowledge,
              a kind of knowledge one acquires by processes we call experiential or intuitive
              rather than ratiocinative; hence it is a kind of knowledge which a Western author can
              allow to women as well as to men—and even more readily to his women, since women
              according to Western tradition have fewer rational powers to get in the way of
              whatever intuitive powers they may happen to possess.

          Moritz-Siebeck &amp;
                Schultz (1968, p. 42): Unlike the present theater of
            the absurd the feelings of estrangement and loss grip only the stage characters, not the
            audience, which knows that there must be an ending to all the confusions. The audience
            can simply enjoy what they see without anxiety (Ger.).

          Thompson (1971,
            p. 56): In order to exploit to the utmost the comic situation of lovers
              wooing at cross purposes, love at first sight, that is, instantaneous conversion to
              the religion of love, commits Antipholus of Syracuse . . . to a lifelong, ennobling
              devotion to his lady. Unfortunately, his lady is Luciana, who believes him to be her
              own brother-in-law and thinks his pledges of love the utterings of a mind vilely
              deranged. Emboldened by the fervor that the religion of love inspires, however,
              Antipholus protests his regeneration by the power of love [quotes 826–7].

          This admixture of the religion of love and classic farce with the
              resultant transformation of love farce into the romance of marriage exemplifies the
              English habit of freely transferring conventions from one decorum to another,
            a practice condemned by Continental theorists but enjoyed by English practitioners.

          Leggatt (1974,
            pp. 3–4, 8, 18–19): The market-place atmosphere of Plautus is still
              present, but it no longer monopolizes the play; it is varied by suggestions of fantasy
              and mystery, and the result is a mixture of styles that goes much deeper than changes
              from verse to prose, or the varying of metres. It is a mixture of different ways of
              viewing the world, of which different dramatic styles are ultimately a reflection. Nor
              is the decision to mix idioms in this way artificially imposed; it springs from
              Shakespeare’s own fresh and imaginative meditation on the central idea of Plautus, the
              idea of confusion. . . . And in exploiting the situations arising from [confusion],
              Shakespeare demonstrates that confusion, the gap of understanding between one mind and
              another, can exist at a deeper level than who’s-got-the-chain or which-twin-is-it-this-time. . . . The characters seem at times to inhabit
              different worlds, different orders of experience.

          Some of this effect is created by the mingling—and, at times, the
              collision—of dramatic styles. In II.ii Adriana, meeting the man she thinks is her
              husband, attacks him passionately for straying [4] from
              her. . . . Taken out of context, the speech is passionate and earnest. . . . But the
              context is all-important. Adriana’s speech follows immediately—with no transition
              whatsoever—a racy comic turn between Dromio and Antipholus on time, falling hair and
              syphilis; she breaks in on two characters who are operating in quite a different
              dramatic world. And any chance we might have of making the transition from one mode to
              the other and taking Adriana’s speech seriously is killed by the fact that all her
              high talk about the closeness of the marriage bond is directed at the wrong
              Antipholus. On 1224–33, Here, the attitude of each character is comically
              dislocated. The courtesan is simply living her casual, material life, while Antipholus
              is struggling between heaven and hell. . . . The contrast is driven home, once again,
              by the different styles of speech—the casual chatter of the courtesan, the explosive
              horror of Antipholus, and on the side, Dromio’s more familiar recognition of the
              powers of evil. . . . 

          [8] In the commercial and domestic spheres he
              [E. Antipholus] inhabits, disruption may be fun for the audience, but it is unsettling
              and unpleasant for the victim. . . . 

          [18] The play presents a story starting from a
              fantastic premise and moving to an almost equally fantastic conclusion. But at the
              same time, for all its artificiality, it deals with the most normal and intimate
              relations of life—wives and husbands, parents and children. In comparing the different
              worlds the Antipholus brothers inhabit, we saw an intersection of the special and
              fantastic with the normal and everyday—Ephesus as a town of sorcerers, and as a town
              of merchants. The same intersection of the fantastic and the normal becomes part of
              the audience’s own experience as it watches the play—a strange and stylized fable
              built out of the most familiar relationships of life. The result of this interweaving
              of the fantastic and the everyday is to make us see each kind of experience from the
              perspective of the other—just as Antipholus of Syracuse is brought to see the ordinary
              tradesmen as Lapland sorcerers [1194], or the Abbess sees the coincidental rejoining of a long-sundered
              family as an event as natural as childbirth. The comic strategy of the play is one of
              dislocation, forcing us to see [19] experiences from a fresh
              perspective, reminding us that no one understanding of life is final. The mixed
              dramatic mode gives shading and variety to what could have been a one-note, mechanical
              farce; but it also embodies a comic vision of the instability of life
            itself.

          Miola (1974,
            pp. 23–4): In an age which equates realism with truth, we are quite naturally
              puzzled by the shameless artificiality of early Shakespearean comedy. . . . We can
              discern in these plays only the faintest resemblance to that complex, sometimes
              painful run of events and personalities which we encounter in daily life.

          How then are we to take pleasure in these plays (LLL, MND, Err.)? By seeing them as controlled by
            the notion of play, as in Huizinga, Homo Ludens.

          (P. 24): Art need not refer to any external reality any more than a chess game
              need imitate an actual battle in order to afford us pleasure. Hence, many of
            the incidents in Err. please us because they are playful.

          Salingar (1974)
            surveys classical and Renaissance Italian comedies to show how Sh. adopted and
            transformed the traditions available to him. Err. is dealt with
            passim, topic by topic, such as use of deceit, use of the trickster, double plots, wars
            in the background, and the like.

          Altman (1978,
            pp. 165–6, 173): The Comedy of Errors differs
              from the Latinate plays we have been considering in that it contains no motivating
              intrigue. . . . An important object of his play [Gascoigne’s Supposes] was to imitate the intellectual affirmations with which human
              beings construct a reasonable world for themselves. The Comedy of
                Errors examines this phenomenon in a form so concentrated as to be virtually
              a symbolic distillation of the theme. For here, with no attempt at
                deception, the plot is a congeries of supposes based on
              appearances that pass for realities. . . . 

          
            Shakespeare, therefore, has created a play that has no other object of
              imitation than the conjectures and affirmations upon which people act. [166] Why? It was his common practice, even in early work, to
              examine the serious implications of his sources. . . . [Perhaps] the original Donatan
              concept of comedy arising from a basic error, supplemented by Lambinus’s enumeration
              of errors in the Menaechmi, and perhaps Gascoigne’s notes
              [i.e., marginal An other suppose], stimulated him to think about the
              moral significance of error. . . . 
          

          [173] It is not surprising that the cognitio takes place only after Antipholus
              gives up his attempt to decipher the puzzle on his own, throwing himself instead upon
              the mercies of a divine agency. We have had intimations of this gesture before,
              although it has never been so fully dramatized. It acknowledges the final inability of
              human wit to extricate itself from the condition of mystery in which it is implicated,
              and its need for some transcendent power to reveal the truth. . . . 

          
            And this, it would appear, is the larger reason for the presence of
              Aegeon and Aemilia in the city.
          

          Bergeron (1980,
            p. 113), on the romance tradition and how it affects the plot of Err.: To generalize, I suggest that The
                Comedy of Errors represents the night world of romance whereas Twelfth Night contains the idyllic world. Indeed, The Comedy of Errors may seem anti-romantic, thanks, I
              believe, to its reliance on Plautine comedy as a model. . . . 

          
            Egeon sounds the gloomy tone of the [first] scene. . . . The language
              pulsates throughout with words of hopelessness. . . . 
          

          
            What Egeon rehearses at length is the expository narrative of the
              family’s separation and seeming destruction, those problems in the romantic night
              world engendered by storm and shipwreck—hell and high water. . . . Often in The Comedy of Errors it seems that this story has little to do
              with the rest of the play, and I think that part of Shakespeare’s difficulty in the
              play is in fact to reconcile this dark romantic story with the rest of the
              plot. . . . 
          

          
            He literally frames the play . . . with romance, while much of the
              internal action seems antiromantic with its lack of love quest, its preoccupation with
              time and material objects, and perhaps even its frenetic pace. In one line, however,
              the Abbess sounds the idyllic note to counter the night world of romance: [quotes 1896]. It is both a definition of romance and
              of much Shakespearean comedy.
          

          
          Garber (1980,
            pp. 121–3) places the happy ending of Shn. comedies including Err. into an anthropological context: Shakespearean comedy is
              about the initial avoidance or displacement of the idea of death, the cognition and
              recognition of one’s own mortality—and then, crucially, the acceptance, even the
              affirmation, of that mortality. In a sense . . . what we are speaking of is a process
              of neutralization, in anthropological terms a removing of the experience of death from
              a sacred to a neutral zone—a desacralization, a normalization, a refusal to privilege
              death. . . . 

          One significant hallmark of Shakespeare’s comedies [122] is that no character ever brought to life in them will suffer death by
              the play’s close. Egeon is an example.

          In each of the comedies there is at least one memento mori, one character or speech that throws a dark
              shadow across the play, one reminder that all holiday is bounded by
              everyday. . . . The bound Egeon is such a figure, framing the comedy with a visual
              emblem of mortality. The mechanics of farce . . . is given a somber tinge by the
              ironic juxtaposition of the play’s first two scenes. S. Antipholus does not
            inquire about the threatened Syracusan merchant. Such self-[123]absorption, the play suggests, may lead to death—one’s own or
              another’s. . . . Marriage, comedy’s traditional close, [is] the alternative to
              death.
          

          French (1981,
            p. 77) sees the play as contrasting the outlaw feminine principle with the inlaw
            masculine principle that seeks order. The essay comprises assertions, unsupported by
            quotation, about many kinds of such principles as the following:

          
            The surface life of Ephesus . . . is firmly in the control of the
              masculine principle. The political background is a power struggle between two cities
              which has resulted in a law which is inhumane but legitimate, and is thus an example
              of that principle in an oppressive form. Aegeon’s lack of money (power) traps him in
              the law, and as a result, his life is forfeit. The Duke, who represents this set of
              values, is moved by Aegeon’s story, but insists he may not disannul
                ([147]) the law. Nevertheless, at the
              end . . . he does precisely that: there is no mention of the fine at the end. This
              change cannot be attributed to a psychological shift in the Duke; it is a result of
              the moral revision of the entire society that develops from the events of the
              comedy.
          

          
            The two gender principles appear at their worst at the opening of the
              play. The feminine is outlaw, connected with sorcery and rebelliousness; the masculine
              is oppressive, inhumane. And the world depicted is an unhappy one: a husband and wife
              quarrel with each other; a husband is unfaithful; a wife is jealous and rebellious;
              servants are brutalized; greed and competitiveness imbue male relationships. The bonds
              linking this society are codified into law, but law does not keep E. Antipholus from
              frequenting a courtesan, Adriana from feeling resentment, masters from beating their
              servants.
          

          Crewe (1982, p.
            203): I . . . consider the playwright implied in the
              play rather than the William Shakespeare whom we believe on good authority to have
              written The Comedy of Errors. This playwright
              is not the real-life author but the idealized figure whose nature and activity the
              play itself implies. The rationality of this playwright is
              not . . . to be taken for granted—on the familiar if radically untenable assumption,
              for example, that Shakespeare always knows what he is doing—but is
              itself at stake in the play. The achievement of a rationale for The Comedy of Errors, and thus of
              a rational identity for the playwright, requires both that the arbitrariness of the
              play’s inherited conventions and the farcical character of the comedy of mistaken
              identity in some measure be redeemed. I will suggest that in the process of
                redeeming the play, and thus himself, the playwright assumes no fixed
              identity, but rather hesitates between two identities, that of God and that of the
              Good Physician.

          
            The implied playwright . . . manifests himself either as a benevolent
              deity, omniscient and omnipotent, whose good will anticipates the entire course of the
              play, or as a good physician, working through comic conventions to
              purge melancholy, impart self-knowledge, and exorcise psychic demons.
          

          Hunter (1997,
            pp. 118–20): The gap between the Inns of Court production of Supposes and that of The Comedy of
              Errors . . . measures [119] the whole story of the
              establishment of Elizabethan commercial drama. By the time of Shakespeare’s play there
              was a well-founded professional theatre in London with a considerable repertory and a
              sophisticated technique to express the nuance of individual experience. And
              Shakespeare draws directly on this inheritance in handling his story of old Aegeon,
              the despairing father of a disintegrated family who is brought into The Comedy of Errors to confront the hard-headed world of Plautine
              farce. . . . In The Comedy of Errors . . . we begin not
              with the society [of the Menaechmi] but with the intruder and
              victim, old Aegeon, and in the light of his experience we see the traveller less in
              terms of his adaptability than his disorientation, his loneliness, his despair of ever
              finding his family. . . . 

          The clear opposition . . . between fact and fiction [in Menaechmi], sense and sensibility, seems to be one that
              Shakespeare is not anxious to preserve. Messenio perceives [120] that the emotional story of the lost twin brother is too like romantic
              fiction to be tolerable as a guide to action. But Shakespeare apparently is happy to
              suggest that the factual details of our experience cannot be extricated from the
              explanatory matrix of our romantic fictions. The Comedy of
                Errors derives the true story of old Aegeon . . . from the
                mouldy tale of Gower’s Apollonius of Tyre.

          Smith (1997)
            offers an anthropological study that integrates Err. into the
            events that make up Gesta Grayorum, which he sees as a ceremony
            designed to initiate the young men of Gray’s Inn into their male identities (p. 121):
              The enterprise of manhood in The Comedy of Errors and
                Gesta Grayorum finds and proclaims a male identity that
              satisfied, for early modern England, the same three needs that the codes of manhood
              continue to fulfill in cultures all over the world. With respect to the material
              environment, it establishes an imperial project that expands the emerging capitalist
              economy at the same time that it satisfies the particular economic needs of unlanded
              gentlemen. With respect to controlling ideology, it articulates that material project
              in terms appropriated from the traditional code of chivalry. With respect to
              individual psychology, it gives men a cautiously negotiated distinction from women and
              a group identity as brothers in arms.

          Hanna (1998)
            contrasts Sh.’s Roman works with his Greek ones, the Roman plays marked by the
            centrality of Rome itself, with its disciplined sternness, and the Greek plays, marked
            by voyaging. She reviews contemporary attitudes toward Greek culture (its democracy was
            bad; it loved adventure at the expense of maintaining a disciplined polity; its morals
            were slack), and believes Sh. imbibed these characterizations. Her focus is on the sea
            (p. 121): The temptation of the sea toward fantasy . . . does not always produce
              delusion and disaster. The willingness to venture forth on the seas even at great risk
              to oneself . . . Shakespeare has made the heroic impulse of his first comedy with a
              Greek setting, expressed in the Sicilian Antipholus’s gentle lament: [quotes 199–204]. Equally
              heroic, if perhaps less fanciful, Egeon has sailed to farthest Greece, /
                Roaming clean through the the bounds of Asia ([135–6]) in search of his son.
              Moreover, in the Greek comedies, unrestrained fantasy gives rise to delightful
              confusions of identity and amusing suggestions of downward metamorphoses in
              atmospheres of geographical wonders. In The Comedy of Errors
              with its exotic place names [sic] (Centaur, Phoenix, Porpentine), fantasies about
              sorcery, witchcraft, and demonic possession threaten to veer out of
            control.

        





        
          Mixed Tones

          Jacobi (1937,
            p. 56): The tone is one of grotesque comedy dependent on situations and not at all on
            character (Ger.).

          
          Elliott
            (1939–40, pp. 98–102, 106): Aegeon’s opening sorrow is immense, not the result of
            circumstance but is constitutional. On the whole, his story takes hold of us. His
              emotion helps to float the strange episode of the mast that served as a helpful
                ship (line [106]) to save the
              lives of six, and then to divide them nicely into the two triads required by the plot.
              But the author fails to bring out unmistakably the sole aspect of the tale that could
              render it fully plausible, namely its weirdness or uncanniness. Certainly this note is
              present, but not explicitly enough. . . . Relatively too much stress is placed on the
              pathos of the romance, and too little on its weirdness. This error is not made in the
              final scene of the play. There the pathetic joy of the recognition and
              reunion . . . is skilfully intermixed with the characteristic comedy of this
              drama.

          The second scene is artfully attached to the first. (P. 99): The fine
              point . . . is that his [S. Antipholus’s] very air [of gravity] is felt to be fathered by Aegeon’s, though quite different. The old man’s
              voluble gloom gives place to the son’s sober sadness. And this humour
              (mood) is susceptible of lightening . . . [quotes 182–4]. Thus the mood . . . is
              modulated in the direction of mirth. . . . Note the comic irony of his I will
                go lose myself (line [193]),
              repeated . . . just as Dromio of Ephesus enters to take him for his brother. Superb
              is the sudden but carefully prepared plunge, here, into the comedy of
              errors. . . . The closing speech of the scene and act is notable. Antipholus
              soliloquizes: [quotes 261–8]. [100] This sounds the note of weirdness;
              which, however, is not fully brought out till the close of the second act.

          Meanwhile (II, i) high comedy [i.e., comedy of character], centred in
              Adriana, comes upon the scene. From now on, it gleams through the pattern of the play
              like a thin gold thread, appearing and disappearing. Adriana is comically
            impatient. That [louring (362)] look
              goes along with conduct, potentially at least, violent. And certainly the
              heroine . . . has her full share in its mad doings. Yet louring impatience is merely
              on the surface of her; deep beneath is a devoted, yearning love for her
              husband.

          The pathos of Adriana is subordinated; we are amused by her exaggerations, especially
            her great blaze of jealousy at 363–91 when she hears about Antipholus’s behavior.

          Her confrontation with the wrong Antipholus, 505–39, is especially fine. (P. 101):
              How direct and powerful is the style here over against the neat, conventional
              rhetoric of the preceding quotation. . . . Here the pathos, by itself, would be too
              keen for comedy. But it is checked for us, even as Adriana speaks, by the amazed looks
              of her two Syracusan listeners, wondering what it is all about; and it is submerged by
              the mirth, madder than ever, that ensues.

          Other points that he makes: Dromio’s report of the spherical Nell (p. 102) is a
              superb burlesque of the wooing of Luciana by S. Antipholus.

          S. Dromio and his master are overcome by a dreamlike sense of transformation
              [quotes 583–7],
              romantic in the master, grotesque [quotes 597] in the man.

          Sh. refrains from bringing Nell onto the stage in person. The
              temptation to do so must have been great; the scene would have rejoiced the hearts of
              ninety per cent of his audience. . . . 

          [106] Upon the close of this episode [1599–1760] Aegeon is allowed the
              centre of the stage for fifty lines. The pathos of his appeal to him whom he takes to
              be my only son is very moving, but, of course, it is checked by his
              mistaking Antipholus of Ephesus for him of Syracuse. Thus Aegeon is drawn into the
              atmosphere of illusion; so is even the stiff-backed Duke a little later (line [1850]). The tearful joys of the reunion of
              the old man’s family are finely interwoven with enchanting mistakes (lines [1816–1905]), and
              parodied at the close by the conference of the two Dromios. When Dromio of Syracuse
              declares to his new-found brother (italics mine), There is a fat
                  friend at your master’s house That kitchened me for
                you today at dinner: She shall now be my sister, not my
                  wife . . . [1906–8]  the speaker’s sense of relief is as vast as the girth of
              Nell. This speech brings us back towards everyday reality. Yet it reminds us, surely,
              of this Dromio’s dread of Nell as a diviner and a witch
                ([929, 933]). Thus at the close there is a faint, last flicker of
              the ray of weird light, romantic and comic, that plays upon The
              Comedy of Errors.
          

          Sider (1973, p.
            1): Tone is the only reason why . . . the threat of Aegeon’s execution can hang
              over the whole play without disturbing us much. Chance, which always plays some part
              in life, usurps the place of human planning, which we like to regard as the crucial
              factor. A chance meeting of mast and rock, and a chance disposition of fast and slow
              sails, separated the family. Chance . . . finally reunites everyone. None of the
              crucial events is effected by anyone’s conscious purpose, except the pardoning of
              Aegeon. . . . Aegeon is present not to evoke emotion but to serve the ends of comedy;
              he acts as expositor in the beginning, and his uncertain fate sustains curiosity when
              our interest might flag because the unraveling of a plot based on mistaken identity is
              so singularly predictable.

        

      






      
        Themes and Significance




        
          General Comments

          Two essays cover the themes in a compendious way. Studies that follow these two often
            elaborate what they sometimes merely mention.

          Brooks (1961,
            pp. 66–9): However they [the themes] are deepened and interconnected by
              Shakespeare’s treatment, they are not recondite: for the audience, they are the
              general ideas arising most naturally from the motives and development of the plot, and
              the response of the characters. The play begins and ends with relationship: a family
              torn asunder and reunited. Relationship is the motive that has brought Egeon, and the
              alien Antipholus and Dromio, to the hazards of Ephesus; relationship is threatened by
              the tensions in the marriage of Antipholus the denizen. The chief entanglements spring
              from mistaken identity and mistiming: I see we still did meet each
                other’s man, And I was ta’en for him, and he for me, And thereupon these
                  errors are arose. [1875–7] The twins appear the same, but in
              reality are different; those who meet them are led by appearance into illusion.
              Repeatedly one of the persons assumes that he shared an experience with another, when
              in reality he shared it with a different one. In consequence, the persons cease to be
              able to follow each other’s assumptions, and become isolated in more or less private
              worlds. Mistakes of identity all but destroy relationship, and loss of relationship
              calls true identity yet more in question; the chief persons suspect themselves or are
              suspected of insanity, or of being possessed, surrounded, or assailed by supernatural
              powers—madness or demoniac possession would be the eclipse of the true self, and
              sorcery might overwhelm it. The alien Antipholus and Dromio fear Circean
              metamorphosis; Egeon, that he has been deformed out of recognition by time. Yet the
              hazard of metamorphosis and of the loss of present identity is also the way to fresh
              or restored relationship. Antipholus the bachelor desires that Luciana will transform
              him and create him new; and Adriana’s belief that in marriage the former identities
              coalesce and emerge identified with each other, is true if rightly interpreted. How
              the possessive interpretation, not relinquished by Adriana till almost the end, is at
              odds with the free giving and hazarding in which the wealth and debts of love differ
              from those of commerce, is another central theme, well traced by J. R. Brown.
              Adriana’s envy of a husband’s status contravenes principles of order that for
              Shakespeare and orthodox Elizabethans extended through the whole cosmos. The status of
              husband, and of wife, Kate’s lines in The Shrew imply, are
              related to their places in this hierarchical order: Such duty as
                the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband. [2713–14]

          [67] Adriana comes to style her husband lord,
              and they each lay their case, as each has come to see it, before the Duke, reminding
              themselves and him that the match was first made by his authority. By this point,
              disorder from the various disruptions of relationship has gone so far in the
              community, that only the appeals for justice addressed to the Abbess and to him, God’s
              viceroys spiritual and temporal, are capable, the time now being ripe, of leading to a
              solution.

          
            Not only are the themes organically developed in the action; they are
              organically connected in themselves. At the centre is relationship: relationship
              between human beings, depending on their right relationship to truth and universal
              law: to the cosmic reality behind appearance, and the cosmic order. Trust in mere
              appearance results in illusion and mistakes of identity, thus dislocating
              relationship, and so disrupting order: blind conflict and disorder are inevitable when
              men misconceive true identity and become isolated in private worlds. Besides illusion,
              there are other factors of disorder: revolt against a wife’s place in the cosmic
              hierarchy is the original source of discord in Adriana’s marriage: order is broken,
              too, by everything untimely. As Ovid’s Tempus edax rerum,
              time opposes mutability to the creative cosmic order. By that mutability, identity
              itself may be threatened: Nec species sua
                  cuique manet . . . —the link of time-theme and appearance-theme
              is present in Ovid, and particularly clear in the apostrophe to Time wrung from Egeon
              when he finds himself unrecognized. Here, and in the dread of Circean transformation
              into beasts, metamorphosis is seen in its hostile aspect; but, as we have observed, it
              can also transform for the better: time, too, when it is ripe, brings a new order.
              Till then, patience would mitigate disorder, which cannot be ended till the claims for
              justice, distorted by the claimants’ assumption that their private worlds are real,
              are laid before those who in the hierarchy of order are founts of justice upon earth.
              More than justice is needed: without mercy, the godly prince is not himself; and amid
              the demonstrations of love’s wealth, lacking which there would be little of the genial
              warmth that glows in the conclusion, Solinus is inspired to what he had declared
              impossible, and freely remits the debt Egeon owes the law. In this organic structure,
              of the two themes which next to relationship are the most inclusive, the first, cosmic
              order, presides in Shakespeare’s early Histories; its importance in his drama is well
              recognized, and the importance of the second, appearance and reality, is becoming so.
              The first is a familiar part of the Elizabethan world-picture; the
              second, presumably, has affiliations with Renaissance neo-Platonism.
          

          [68] The themes are given prominence in several
              ways. They are voiced by the speakers, who often relate one theme to another: the
              examples in our analysis of I. ii are characteristic. The dominant imagery, of man as
              beast, reflects the ideas of illusory appearance and malign metamorphosis; above all,
              it mirrors the threats to identity and to status in the cosmic order. Appropriately,
              it stops on the brink of the dénouement
              with the Duke’s explicit formulation: I think you all have drunk
                of Circe’s cup. [1747]

          
            Thematic, likewise, are the two images of the water-drop, its identity
              lost for relationship’s sake. The whole harmonic structure, of which the
              correspondence of images forms part, is a vehicle of the themes. How generosity and
              two degrees of possessiveness in love are defined by juxtaposition of scènes in III. ii, with reference back to
              Adriana’s attitude in Act II, has been shown by J. R. Brown. The supreme instance is
              the parallel between the gossips’ feast to which everyone is going at
              the end, and the dinner from which the husband and his guests were shut out. The
              gossips’ or baptismal feast affirms relationship and identity: the kin are united, the
              Duke is patron, all are friends and godparents; witnesses to the identities now truly
              established and christened into the family and the community; long travail is
              rewarded, and increase (the progressive aspect of cosmic order) which, despite the
              double birth of twins, was mocked by the intervention of mutable fortune, is now truly
              realized. It is not only as a sensational error of identity that the exclusion from
              dinner contrasts with this: balked or broken feasts (G. Wilson Knight has made us
              aware) are recurrent symbols in Shakespeare of the breakdown of human fellowship and
              its pieties. Both this motif, and the extravagant comedy of the barring-out, are
              worked up by the burlesque Lylyan or Erasmian colloquy on whether good cheer or
              welcome makes the feast. The burlesque turns for the clowns belong to
              the harmonic structure in much the same way.
          

          Foakes (ed.
            1962, pp. xliv ff.): The serious force of the presentation of the Antipholus
              twins is paralleled by a more comic treatment of their servants. Each is puzzled at
              being mistaken for the other, and each comes to feel that he is being transformed—but
              into an ass, rather than another person. So Dromio of Ephesus suffers like an ass from
              the blows of his master ([637]), and,
              finding that another has assumed his office and identity as a servant in Adriana’s
              household, and that for his service he is rewarded with still more blows as his master
              grows angrier, he resigns himself to his topsy-turvy world with a humorous acceptance
              of it: [quotes 1308–13]. S. Dromio likewise speaks of transformation: (p. xlv)
              [Quotes 590–7]. . . . Each Dromio applies the term ass in relation to
              the beatings he is made to suffer . . . but the idea of being made a beast operates
              more generally in the play, reflecting the process of passion overcoming reason, as an
              animal rage, fear, or spite seizes on each of the main characters.

          
            For the sense of loss or change of identity in these figures goes
              together with a disruption of family, personal, and social relationships. Antipholus
              of Syracuse loses himself in the search for his mother and brother, but is hailed by
              all in Ephesus as if they knew him well; even as he thinks that he is subject to
                imaginary wiles ([1193]),
              he is, unwittingly, causing a rift in the marriage of Adriana and his brother, and
              stirring discord between Antipholus of Ephesus and, on the one hand Angelo . . . , on
              the other hand the Courtesan, over the matter of the chain. In the confusion which
              follows upon his dining with Adriana, the new self he had found in his passion for
              Luciana is frustrated; confirmed in his belief that he wanders in illusions ([1225]), he comes on at the end of Act IV,
              sword in hand, to drive her and Adriana off as witches. At the same
              time, Antipholus of Ephesus, denied entry to his own house, comes to believe that he
              is the victim of a plot, and that his wife is a strumpet ([1416]). . . . The normal intercourse of the
              city in its friendly, commercial relationships is also disturbed, to the extent that
              the Second Merchant, believing himself wronged, [xlvi] puts
              both Angelo and Antipholus under arrest, and the long-standing trust between these two
              is destroyed. The confusions of identity, involving for Antipholus of Syracuse and the
              two Dromios a sense especially of loss or transformation, and for Antipholus of
              Syracuse a need defiantly to assert his identity in a world that seems to go mad, thus
              lead to a breakdown of the social order through the frustration of personal
              relationships. Quarrels and arrests follow. . . . 
          

          The growth of this disorder is reflected in two other strands in
              language and action which reinforce the serious undertones of the comedy. One is the
              establishment of Ephesus as a place associated with witchcraft. Antipholus of Syracuse
              arrives there with a prejudice about the city: [quotes 263–8]. Foakes lists the
            witchcraft passages, 832, 834; 946; 1249, 1250. The prejudice which he has on reaching Ephesus provides a
              ready explanation for all the strange things that happen to him, and becomes a settled
              conviction; he is more and more dis­[xlvii]abled from
              distinguishing between what is real and what is not, until the whole city seems to him
              to be in the grip of an evil power: [quotes 1224–6].

          Antipholus of Ephesus, by contrast, regards himself as alone sane in a
              world gone mad. He is given some force of character, and a tendency to violence, so
              that when he is shut out of his own house, he is driven to bewilderment and to
              passionate exclamation; though calmed for a moment by Balthasar, he thinks of
              punishing his wife by going at once to the Courtesan’s, and by bestowing a
                rope’s end ([998]), i.e.
              a whipping, upon Adriana and her confederates. He invents an
              explanation of her treatment of him with this word; he decides he is the victim of a
              conspiracy confirmed by the incidents that befall him thereafter.

          
            The confusions of identity and consequent disruptions of normal relationships
              force the characters to judge events according to their own private ordering of
              experience, as Adriana, too, is ready, at the suggestion of the Courtesan, to think
              her husband mad, and treat him as a dangerous lunatic. Out of the clashes of these
              private worlds of experience emerges another strand in language and action which is of
              some importance, a sense of evil at work in Ephesus. Dromio of Syracuse jests about
              the Officer who arrests Antipholus of Ephesus, calling him a devil, One that,
                before the judgment, carries poor souls to hell ([1149]); he is quibbling on the last judgment, and on a
              common term for prison, but his jest, as is characteristic of the word-play of the
              Dromios, quickly becomes earnest when he meets his own master in the next scene [fn.
              comparing jokes on mistiming—205 ff., 450 ff.—which turn out to have a
                bearing on the disorder later in the play—450–503 and 1025–67—and the way in which
                Dromio of Syracuse both parodies and reinforces his master’s prejudices in his
                account of the kitchen-wench, Nell—933]. For Antipholus of Syracuse really thinks of the Courtesan as a
                fiend, and uses to her Christ’s words, Satan, [xlviii] avoid, spoken in rejection of the devil’s
              temptation in the wilderness; and if the Officer was a devil in an everlasting
                garment to Dromio, the Courtesan now becomes the devil’s dam.
              A little later, Adriana puts her husband, as a man possessed by the
                fiend, into the hands of an exorcist, who chants, [quotes 1338–9]. These hints of
              the devil at work mark a stage in the play when the appearance of normal order breaks
              down, and the action erupts into violence, as one Antipholus is bound, and the other
              rushes in to attack a group he believes are witches—a group that
              includes the Officer of the law.
          

          In Act 5, Egeon, bound, comes on with the Duke, the representative of justice, who is
            appealed to by Adriana and then E. Antipholus for justice. Each clamours for an
              idea of justice based on a private ordering of experience, and the conflicting
              evidence of witnesses and supporters sets a problem too difficult for the law to
              solve; the Duke cries, [quotes 1747–8]. His words nicely suggest the kind and degree of
              transformation that has taken place in the citizens of Ephesus; they are behaving
              madly, and there is no order or coherence in what they allege against one
              another.

          To make matters worse, Egeon seizes the opportunity to appeal [xlix] for help to the son he sees before him, but Antipholus of Ephesus does
              not know him. The law cannot deal with this situation, and it is time for the Abbess
              to reappear, with the second Antipholus. The mistakes are explained. It
              is as if, through her intervention, the harsh justice embodied in the Duke is tempered
              by a Christian grace and mercy. . . . Here the characters recover or discover their
              real identity, order is restored, and the two pairs of twins follow the others off
              stage. . . . Violence is replaced by mildness and love, and the sense of witchcraft,
              evil, and Circean transformation is dispelled.

          He quotes Wylie Sypher, Comedy (1956, p. 22) and Northrop
            Frye, The Argument of Comedy,
            English Institute Essays (1948, p. 61) on how comedy is a
            triumph over mortality and the means by which an individual is freed from unwanted
            social bonds, saying that these formulations, while too grand for Err. in total, have some relevance. (P. xlix): The terms of the first description are too large . . . , but clearly they
              have some relevance; there is the hint of a sacrifice in Egeon, the hero-victim
              brought to the point of death, and the comic action leads in its vitality to a kind of
              resurrection, a rebirth, the baptismal feast at the end. The second description [l] too applies in some degree; in this view, the moral
                norm is not morality, but deliverance, so that comedy is seen to be both
              radical and conservative. It may make the outsider, the man who does not fit into our
              society or its conventions, into a victim, exposing him or driving him out, like Dr.
              Pinch; and it may also expose the hollowness of a society’s pretensions by setting
              them against the exuberance of a figure like Dromio of Syracuse. . . . 

          
            These general considerations may help to illustrate the particular
              quality of The Comedy of Errors. The play has farcical
              comedy, and it has fantasy, but it does more than merely provoke laughter, or release
              us temporarily from inhibitions and custom into a world as free as a child’s,
              affording delight and freshening us up. It also invites compassion, a measure of
              sympathy, and a deeper response to the disruption of social and family relationships
              which the action brings about. Our concern for the Antipholus twins, for Adriana and
              Luciana, and our sense of disorder are deepened in the context of suffering provided
              by the enveloping action. The comedy proves, after all, to be more than a temporary
              and hilarious abrogation of normality; it is, at the same time, a process in which the
              main characters are in some sense purged, before harmony and the responsibility of
              normal relationships are restored at the end. Adriana learns to overcome her jealousy,
              and accepts the reproof of the Abbess; her husband is punished for his anger and
              potential brutality by Doctor Pinch’s drastic treatment; and Antipholus of Syracuse is
              cured of his prejudices about Ephesus. Behind them stands Egeon, a prototype of the
              noble sufferer or victim in later plays [Antonio in MV,
              Pericles].
          

        





        
          Identity

          Loss of identity, a particularly 20th-c. anxiety, becomes an increasingly fertile
            topic; its psychoanalytic approaches are dealt with separately below, but the separation
            is difficult to keep clean.

          Elliott
            (1939–40, p. 95): I think the underlying reason for [the play’s] success is the
              fact that Shakespeare was thoroughly penetrated by the comic horror, so to call it,
              implicit in the subject. Real horror attaches to the notion of the complete identity of two human beings; as in Poe’s ghastly tale of a girl who
              turned out to be the re-embodiment of the mother who died in giving birth to her; and
              as in certain ancient legends of various lands, notably China. All normal persons (and
              especially Shakespeare) set so much store by human individuality that they shrink from
              the thought of its being submerged. And since the amusing, when intense, is nigh to
              the serious, there is something shuddery in the close resemblance of persons just when
              this appears to us intensely entertaining. I recall a school-teacher many years ago
              who found in her class at the beginning of the term two little girls who were
              remarkably, even weirdly, identical twins. . . . At the end of the
              first week the teacher exclaimed to us all with comic horror: These two are the
                same—how can I tell them apart? After a moment of dead silence a small boy
              (not I) piped out, Mary’s temper’s better’n Martha’s. The general
              laughter which ensued had in it a note of relief that was not exclusively comic. And
                The Comedy of Errors has a note of real weirdness just when
              its mirth is keenest.

          Brooks (1961,
            pp. 58–60): The idea of his [S.Antipholus’s] losing himself [204] is taken up in a profound sense, and
              couched in a fine image commensurate with its thematic importance. The theme of
              identity is here linked with those of relationship (dislocated or re-established), and
              of risk. To seek reunion with the lost members of the family, Antipholus is risking
              his identity; yet he must do so, for only if the full relationship is restored can he
              find content. And then, hints the image of one water-drop seeking another, the present
              individual identity will be lost, or transformed, in another way. It is to claim a
              sinking of identity in the marriage-relation, with the emergence of a new identity,
              where each is also the other, that Adriana uses the closely similar image in II.ii. In
              the play’s harmonic structure, while this soliloquy is thus recalled at that point, in
              its own place it recalls the situation of Egeon, who on virtually the same quest as
              Antipholus, has so risked his mortal identity that it is forfeit to the [59] executioner. Antipholus’ fear that he is losing himself is
              full of comic irony. No sooner has he expressed it, than, with the entry of his
              brother’s Dromio, he begins to be the victim of the successive mistakes of identity to
              which his words are designed by Shakespeare as a prelude, and in the course of which
              he will come to wonder whether he is beside himself, and has lost himself
              indeed. Brooks lists the mistakes based on confused identity, then It
              is by mistaking appearance for reality that Antipholus and his brother’s Dromio
              misidentify one another. The threat to the very self involved in the confusion of
              appearance and reality is the thought most [60] vividly
              conveyed in Antipholus’ second soliloquy [261–71]. . . . The lines [265–6] seize the imagination of the
              audience at the deep level where the ancient dread of losing the self or soul is very
              much alive. They are highly characteristic of the imaginative Antipholus, develop the
              idea in his first soliloquy that his self is at hazard, and set the pattern for his
              interpretations of the strange experiences that befall him henceforward.

          Foakes (ed.
            1962, pp. xliii ff.) works over the identity theme, beginning with the drop of
              water (199–204) speech, the fear of transformation on the part of S. Antipholus, the
            stronger, angrier response of E. Antipholus to his wife’s behavior, and his imprisonment
            in the dark cellar.

          Hunter (1962,
            p. 303): It is the threat of the loss of identity that draws forth the most
              powerful poetry in the play: [quotes 1788–99].

          Jorgensen (ed.
            1964, pp. 22–3): Mistaken identity is in itself an additional blow to
              the individual ego. One is seldom pleased to find that he is constantly being taken
              for someone else—usually, of course, someone much less impressive. There are, however,
              several kinds of mistaken identity. This play employs the lowest. The two higher
              forms . . . are mistaking the true nature of another person and mistaking one’s own
              nature. Both lead to a re-examination of life and involve character growth. Exteriors
              are important only in so far as they lead to a realization of one’s true nature. Of
              these two higher forms there are only hints in The Comedy of
                Errors. Antipholus of Syracuse asks a question that might have been
              all-important in a later comedy: [quotes 608–10]. [23] This is a remote
              approach to the agonizing and central question which Angelo in Measure for Measure asks himself: What dost thou? or what art thou,
                Angelo? [936]—a question
              preparing him for a totally new understanding of his own nature. On a still higher
              level—and showing that mistaken identity is fundamental to Shakespearean tragedy as
              well—is Lear’s question: Who is it that can tell me who I am? [743].

          
            There is no probing of personality in The Comedy of
                Errors. No one learns more about himself or his neighbor as a result of the
              errors. Confusion leads to near-madness but does not bring about the breakdown of an
              ego prior to self-knowledge; it leads rather to drawn swords and head-blows. The
              resolution of the play is not the serene elevation of vision which we find in the
              later comedies; it is simply a recognition of who, physically, is who.
          

          Williams (1964,
            pp. 70–1): The Comedy of Errors is an early
              study in the nature of personal identity. How soon does one’s conception of oneself,
              the belief in one’s own identity, break down before lack of recognition on the part of
              others? How far do we need others in order to have an identity at all? Is one’s
              identity entirely dependent on the personal and social links and bonds, the ties of
              family, love, friendship and civic duty? In order that these questions might be
              tackled without in this case leading to madness and violent death, as they do in
                King Lear, Shakespeare added the twin
              servants. . . . 

          [71] What seems to have happened in
              Shakespeare’s handling of the story is this. He found the predicament of Antipholus of
              Syracuse far from farcical, but rather an opportunity to probe into the nature of
              personal identity. To provide another view of the problem he added . . . the ordeal
              of Egeon and his denial by Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus, who of course do not know
              him. . . . 

          
            The Comedy of Errors was kept by Shakespeare on
              a comic level only by the introduction of the two Dromios.
          

          Levin (ed. 1965,
            pp. xxxvii f.): E. Antipholus takes for granted the stable comforts of
              his Ephesian citizenship.

          
            What greater shock for him, then, than to bring a party of fellow
              citizens home to his well-established household for lunch and to discover that
              household preempted by roistering strangers, to be shut out in the street, to have
              one’s own door slammed in one’s own face? Or is it one’s own? The sense of alienation,
              that Verfremdungseffekt so
              characteristic of Brecht and of the twentieth-century theater, is all the greater when
              our image of ourselves depends for its corroboration upon a settled context, and when
              we come to realize—what tragedy teaches us—that it is our destiny to be
              displaced. . . . [Quotes 199–200.] Antipholus of Syracuse . . . realiz[es] that he is less likely to
              find a mother and a brother than to be irretrievably lost himself. Later, Adriana,
              addressing him as if he were Antipholus of Ephesus, likens their imperiled love to a
              drop of water into the sea; and he has a similar exchange with Luciana. The Syracusan
              twin is conscious that he must lose his identity in order to find it; the Ephesian
              twin is not; but he must, and he does. And Dromio too—both Dromios, whichever is
              which—must undergo their crises of identity: Am I Dromio? Am I your man? Am I
                myself? [864–5].
          

          
            Modern psychological fiction is haunted by doubles, sometimes as overtly
              as in the tales of Hoffmann, Poe, and Dostoevsky, or in The Jolly Corner of Henry James, where the Black Stranger is recognized as
              the self that might have been. . . . [xxxviii] That alter ego
              may be demon or devil, good angel or evil genius. It may be the retribution of
              conscience—Philip Drunk reprehended by Philip Sober—or, at the other extreme, the
              vicarious pleasure the artist enjoys through the playboy, the envy of Shem for Shaun.
              All this may well be a far cry from Plautine or even Shakespearean farce, to which we
              should be glad that we can escape from our more introspective dilemmas. . . . Having
              been restored once more to our familiar world, we laugh away the shudder of
              estrangement.
          

          Cutts (1968,
            pp. 15–20): S. Antipholus’s coming to Ephesus in one sense reflects his
              growing concern with the discontent which is himself, and in another his escape from
              self—his decision to wander up and down [194] to weary his identity with restless motion and
                in this mist at all adventures go ([612]). Not until his self is symbolically returned to him
              in the glass ([1909]) of
              his image at the very end of the play is the dream texture of his existence shattered
              into something like reality, and he is in amity with his identity, but ironically he
              hardly knows how to accept it as reality since his happiness of discovery is concerned
              with Luciana, who would never have [16] appeared to him if
              error had not driven his eyes and ears amiss [579]. . . . 

          [17] Antipholus of Ephesus is escaping from his
              identity too. This is the pointed irony of his being faced with his own rude
              mechanical servant self, Ephesian Dromio, who charges that he did deny
                &lt;his&gt; wife and house ([627]). The humor of the error of Ephesian Dromio mistaking Syracusian
              Antipholus for his master obviously carries the moment in the comedy of errors, but
              the underlying reflection may be much more important. [18]
              Ephesian Antipholus’s own handwriting would tell ([632]) on the parchment of his own skin ([631]) what his servant sense would tell him if he knew how
              to recognize it. The metaphorical beating he gives this servant sense is a vain
              attempt to ignore its lesson. 

          
            The very first introduction of Antipholus of Ephesus . . . shows him
              trying to create the image of a displaced Antipholus, shut out from his house and from
              his marital bed by a shrewish wife. The jeweled necklace . . . is ironically to
              afford him both an excuse for not having been at home—Say that I linger’d with
                you at your shop ([621]), and
              much more significantly a decoy of a fair presence [799]—vice appareled like virtue’s harbinger
                ([798]), but its most serious
              significance lies in the fact that it is the symbol of the marriage chain he is trying
              to run away from and of the unlawful love ([1518]) that he is running to link himself
              with. . . . 
          

          There is no doubt that Antipholus of Ephesus is attempting to escape
              from the chain of marriage. This is the force of his remark to Angelo for not having
              brought him the [19] jeweled chain—Belike you thought
                our love would last too long / If it were chain’d together . . .  ([1008–9]).
            Cutts appears to
            think that E. Antipholus is talking about his wife, but surely he is talking about the
            Courtesan (see 775–80).

          (P. 20): The characters . . . are fundamentally incapable of seeing beyond the
              outward appearances which serve to complicate and confuse the management of their
              affairs. Although dimly aware of a need for identity and a need to face their problems
              on a deeper level than the one of mere external manifestation, they lack the power to
              pursue this need, for they are, after all, little more than [21] puppets at the mercy of a master manipulator. The real dramatic significance
              of their presentation, however, lies in the fact that each is presented with the
              adumbrations of a solution to his problem in the existence of his alter ego, and his
              inability to profit thereby is the result of powers as yet unrecognized, which blind
              him to the importance of the image in the glass.

          Berry (1972,
            pp. 29–30): The problem of identity is connected with that of
              names. . . . Antipholus of Syracuse takes names as a proof of identity; How
                can she thus then call us by our names? / Unless it be by inspiration ([560–1]). It is a test
              of reality, an echo of Egeon’s statement that the twins could not be
                distinguished but by names ([56]). Antipholus needs these assurances, for his sense of identity—never very
              strong—is rapidly weakened by the assured behavior of the Ephesians: [quotes 575–8]. He yields
              readily to the notion that he is in a dream, that his identity
              is lost: [quotes 591]. . . . [30] For Antipholus of Syracuse, identity is to be confirmed by
              something other than a correction of error. We do not know what he makes of his
              long-sought brother at the end, for he does not tell us; by then it is clear that his
              most important relationship is with Luciana, his sexual complement. It is Luciana that
              satisfies his drive toward identity: [quotes 850–1]. He needs a brother and a wife; with them, and
              parents restored, his quest for identity is at an end.

          
            His brother . . . suffers a totally different loss of
              identity. . . . In the play’s design he is the temperamental complement of his
              brother; his explanation of a disordered world is that the others are mad or leagued
              in conspiracy against him.
          

          Salgādo (1972,
            pp. 81–2) notes Elliott’s essay about the play’s weirdness, with its emphasis on loss
            of individuality: But what is individuality,
              or . . . how do I sense my identity, which is a necessary concomitant of my
              individuality? Is it not in my consciousness of inhabiting an ordered temporal
              dimension, in which, by exercising the functions of retrospect, observation and
              anticipation, I infer from the steady flow of future through present into past, the
              existence of the entity through which this flow passes? . . . Part of the uneasiness
              which underlies our laughter in The Comedy of Errors is
              related to the tricks it plays, in form, language and action, with what we take to be
              a normal temporal sequence.

          
            The duplication of identity in relation to time has two aspects relevant
              to the play. In a general sense, and from the standpoint of the audience, it is a way
              of distorting and distending time. As such it is for us a fulfilment of one of the
              functions of comedy, to transcend in some [82] fashion the
              devouring power of human time, whose movement is always towards decay and
              death. . . . 
          

          
            For the experiencing agents . . . duplication of identity which they
              themselves are unaware of is felt as a dislocation of the ordinary world and of the
              steady single direction of time as the medium of experience. . . . If either of these
              were disrupted, our sense of time would be deranged, as happens in a very mild way
              whenever we watch a film sequence run backwards. . . . A good deal of the
              action . . . can be fairly described as disruption of the sequence of causality and
              of the process of storing up information, from the point of view of those involved in
              it. I send a man off to find out what time the ship sails, and he brings me back a bag
              of gold. I ask him whether he has put my money away safely and he tells me the dinner
              is burning. . . . No information, however recently acquired, can be trusted.
          

          Wells (ed. 1972,
            p. 31): The concept of the absolute external identity of one person with another
              is easily productive of comedy; but it is also frightening. It is a concept that
              Shakespeare, as the father of twins, had special reason to ponder.

          Van Laan (1978,
            pp. 21–6, 43–4, 179–80) devotes a chapter, Identity and Role,
            using Err. to show what it reveals about Shakespeare’s
              sense of dramatic character and of the relation between a character’s identity and
              role-playing. Identity is of course an important dramatic issue throughout
              Shakespeare, yet it is nowhere more explicitly so than in this play. Oddly enough, the
              play offers not one but two definitions of identity, the first perceivable through
              focusing upon action, the second through focusing on character.

          (1) Action. The most recurrent . . . action . . . is the attribution of
              identity to someone who does not correspond to it. Early on the misattributed identity
              is simply that of a second character with whom the first has been confused, but before
              long the process grows more complicated, and thus throughout most of the play the
              falsely attributed identity is a fiction even within the world of the play, a new
              creation, a bizarre composite of the actual identity of one character, cer­[22]tain statements and actions of another, and the wild
              imaginings of a third. Whatever the combination of this basic pattern may be,
              the spectators are continually presented with a discrepancy between
              the projected identity and the character to whom it is attributed.

          What complicates this basic pattern is that, although the discrepancy
              is always obvious to the spectators and usually apparent to the mistaken character, it
              often carries no real weight in the action. Time and time again, it is the attributed
              rather than the actual identity that determines the experience of the character,
              whether he notes the discrepancy or not. When S. Antipholus beats E. Dromio in
            2.1, the mistake is irrelevant as far as poor Dromio is concerned: the beating
              has been administered; in existence if not in essence, Dromio of Ephesus has become
              his Syracusan twin. Another example: E. Antipholus knows he is not the
            imposter in 3.1, but remains locked out. This complication, in which the mistaken
              character is made to undergo experiences appropriate to the identity imposed on him,
              combines well with the fictitiousness of most of the imposed identities. Identity
                per se begins to look like a kind of
              role that one might play as if one were an actor portraying the part of some fictional
              character.

          (2) Identity as a role, e.g., Dromio in 3.1 playing at being the porter at the gate
              (607, 613) where Master, shall I be porter at the
              gate? (613) (p. 23) suggests that in this world there is no real difference between being
              something and playing something. . . . [S.] Antipholus . . . responds in a similar
              fashion. He is bewildered by the presumptuous behaviour of these strange women and
              especially by their commands to himself and Dromio, but he decides to say as
                they say, and persever so ([611]). He too, therefore, agrees to play a role, to take direction from others
              and speak the lines they expect from him; and, like Dromio, he is successful in
              playing his assigned part. He refuses to treat Adriana as a wife, for he instead
              vigorously woos Luciana, but this behaviour, rather than exposing the imposture, is
              interpreted by Adriana as merely the latest and the most outrageous example of her
              husband’s philandering.

          Oddly enough, the characters’ attitudes towards their own identities
              further help to establish this notion of identity as role. When Dromio of Syracuse
              finds an alien identity imposed on him by Adriana and Luciana, he does not, even when
              he gets the chance, insist on the authenticity of his own; instead, he fears he has
              been transformed ([590]). Antipholus thinks he has been transformed. He (p. 24)
              sees his identity, that which should be his most intrinsic possession, as
              perhaps no more an essential part of himself than a dramatic role is of an actor who
              performs it, commenting on 824–9.

          (P. 25): It is . . . in the final scene . . . that Shakespeare most
              clearly establishes the overwhelming importance of external relationships in the
              composition of identity. Here all the characters are properly identified, but only in
              terms of their links with one another, that is, as husbands, wives, fathers, sons,
              mothers, masters, servants, and—most important of all—brothers. The celebration called
              for by Aemilia is properly a nativity feast because the central characters are truly
              reborn. . . . 

          [26] For Pinch and the Duke, identity is
              equivalent to a single role. For most of the others, however, it is a more complicated
              matter because in each case several roles are involved. Yet not even for these others
              is identity some kind of unified personality (character in the
              psychological sense) but rather the nexus of various social roles that they are given
              to play.

          
            Any attempt to penetrate beneath this nexus in search of the
                essential man is doomed to failure. Antipholus of Syracuse mentions
              at one point his soul’s pure truth ([824]), but it is an empty, undramatized cliché without any
              validity. Antipholus has no inner substance; apart from his ability to perform
              properly whichever of his roles the immediate situation seems to call for, or his
              capacity to express bewilderment in response to bewildering events, he is devoid of
                personality. The reason is obvious. Antipholus of Syracuse must lack
              inner substance because the play requires that he be interchangeable with his Ephesian
              twin.
          

          Role-playing is not thematic in Err, but becomes so from
              Shr. on (positing that Err. is first
            in the comic, if not the entire, canon). (P. 43): One reason for the lack of
              explicitness in The Comedy of Errors is that its role-playing
              is primarily an unconscious activity. The characters cannot actually perceive the
              ubiquity of role-playing in themselves . . . because they engage in it only as a
              function of their familial and social ties or as a result of others having imposed
              alien identities on them. None of them indulges in a deliberate attempt to pass
              himself off as something [44] he is not.

          The meaning of the loss of identity, how characters respond to the threat, is the stuff
            of the great tragedies. The loss is managed by having a familiar external reality change
            under one’s feet. (P. 179): This linking of identity loss with the sense of
              dislocated reality and madness indicates that Shakespeare already [in Err.] conceives of the nexus of roles which form a character’s identity as
              the source of his bearings, the means by which he locates himself within and orders
              himself in relation to the wilderness of the universe. Characters must
              respond to the loss or threatened loss [of identity] in some decisive and appropriate
              way—again judging from both The Comedy of Errors and the
              great tragedies, by going mad, resort­[180]ing to violence,
              finding new roles to play, or, perhaps, by some combination of all these
              expediencies.

          French (1981,
            p. 81): At this point in his life [the very beginning of his writing career],
              Shakespeare believed that one’s identity is largely a matter of one’s place in the
              world. This is in contrast to his later belief, given utterance in King Lear, that one’s identity is defined by one’s place on earth, which is
              mere lonely vulnerable mortality. . . . [Err.] insists that
              no matter how we protest, we are what we are socially perceived to be, that outer
              structures determine inner ones, to a greater degree than people raised to worship
              individuality and transcendence may be willing to admit.

          Scott (1982,
            pp. 2–4): Egeon in the first scene is a pathetic old man, isolated in an alien
              land divorced from wife and children through the dictates of wealth and Fortune:
              [quotes 40–7]. [3] This incident was eventually to isolate Egeon from his wife
              and children so that now in Ephesus he has no will to live, his only wish being to
              know whether his family are still alive: [quotes 140–2, 160–1]. The procrastination of his death
              implies that Egeon has spent the last five years, at least, of his life in the despair
              of isolation, searching for his family, his roots which are his identity. It is this
              loss of self-identity not only for Egeon, but for all his relations which is to form
              the kernel of the play; a simple idea at first only proposed by the old man’s pathetic
              tale but soon stated explicitly as a theme, by Antipholus of Syracuse: [quotes 199–204]. It is
              misleading to see this statement as an insight to Antipholus’s characterization. We
              are not watching a comedy dealing in such terms but rather a farce which negates
              characterization in favour of simple archetype. Antipholus’s speech therefore
              naturally becomes a clarification of Egeon’s opening [4]
              statement. . . . Thus Egeon’s exposition is simply clarified by Antipholus before we
              are presented with the complexities of the variations, which in this case we call the
                errors on the theme of the loss of identity. We soon find therefore
              that the three principal characters, Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus,
              and Adriana are comically portrayed as separated from any relationship with another
              person. All are searching, striving, enquiring and yet getting nowhere since there
              seem to be no answers. Such depiction of separation and utter
              loneliness has found expression in the farcical theatre of the absurd.

          Weller (1982,
            p. 346) thinks that the gathering together of the family at the end intimates the
              priority of corporate identities over the single and limited life of the individual
              consciousness. Sh. found this emphasis in Saint Paul’s imagery of Christians
            being members of Christ’s body in Eph.

          Carroll (1985,
            pp. 77 ff.) on the Antipholuses: The crucial difference between them,
              the key to deciphering them, lies in their language; only that finally marks them
              apart. If the Antipholi had lost the power of speech . . . then they would have been,
              for all intents, completely identical. Here is an anomalous case where the retention
              of speech becomes ironic cause for further transformation. And yet names, and all
              language, have been revealed as generically susceptible to metamorphosis. To say
                I, sir, am Dromio [1821],
              is to announce and to undermine one’s identity at the same time, because our names
              uniquely mark us and yet do not mark us. . . . 

          [79] The Dromii end the play by going off
                hand in hand, not one before the other, E. Dromio explaining that
                We came into the world like brother and brother ([1917]). But of course they came into the world not side by
              side, but one after the other, not only the same but also different. Chronology
              therefore becomes an issue: [quotes 1911–15]. E. Dromio then rejects this motion of
              difference, bidding them instead to go out together. It seems a quixotic effort. A
              great deal of the play has gone to show that even minimal difference and boundary
              become crucial to human identity. At the moment of metamorphosis, when S. Dromio
              becomes E. Dromio or vice versa, one or both will temporarily cease to exist.
              Shakespeare has put such a case quite flamboyantly here, with two sets of twins. And
              though the re-naming of the christening feast will go far toward sorting out the
                sympathized one day’s error [1887], we will still recall that the sheerest linguistic thread maintained
              the margin of difference. Two almost became one, or one none.

          Paster (1985)
            makes the city a participant in the comedy (p. 178): The city
              experiences a crisis of its own being which grows out of and is parallel to the
              experience of its characters. The comic crisis that the characters must resolve
              interlocks with the crisis of an entire social order. . . . 

          [186] Only by attending to the nature of the
              urban environment in The Comedy of Errors can the play’s deep
              concern with the ambiguities of personal and civic identity become fully
              realized. . . . Thus, in seeing two Egeons [one with a deeply sad personal story, the
              other a political enemy from Syracuse] where [187] only one
              exists, Ephesus betrays its profound dualism, a communal dualism given literal,
              individual embodiment when the wandering twins step onstage.

          The wandering Antipholus’s first moments onstage also suggest the
              potential doubleness of Ephesus, for even as he is told of its dangerousness for him,
              he accepts a bag of gold [it is, after all, his—see 170]—the gesture emblematic of the commercial exchanges at
              the heart of urban life. More importantly, by characterizing Ephesus as alternately
              welcoming and hostile, as home and alien city, Shakespeare associates the city with
              the closely related archetypal motifs of the pursuing double and of fraternal
              rivalry. . . . The relevance of such archetypes [e.g., Otto Rank, The Double]—particularly the fraternal rivalry that we have already come to
              connect with the idea of the city—allows us to see how Shakespeare uses the farcical
              action of the doubled twins not only as a paradigm of personal self-fulfillment in
              family reunion, but also as a paradigm of the radical connectedness of social
              experience, an ideal relation of self and city which gets tested in the two later
              plays [i.e., MV, MM]. Hence,
            nearly every incident includes the city as player.

          Bruster (1992,
            pp. 74–5): Identity in Shakespeare’s play is connected with gold: more
              specifically, with a chain and a sack of coins . . . [quotes 261–71]. Of special interest here is
              the way Antipholus structures his complaint, framing his trepidation over magicians
                that change the mind and deform the body between the
              first two and the last lines of the passage, where he expresses his fear of monetary
              loss. Indeed, thinking of his money appears to lead him to suspect witchcraft’s power
              over his mind, and from witchcraft he returns to his coins. To this Antipholus, money
              is connected with transformation, inextricably linking identity with
              property. . . . One could see the loss and finding of Antipholus’s money [it was
              never lost] . . . like a dramatic game of [75] fort-da, the money here symbolizing his own identity. . . . It
              is my argument that . . . mental union is carried out first on the material level of
              society.

          
            Adriana . . . has been promised a golden chain . . . which to her
              represents not individual identity, but the binding love within the marital bond of
              which she so often speaks.
          

          Lanier’s (1994)
            context is of Renaissance self-fashioning, in which hierarchical discipline is
            maintained by public marks of character such as were governed by sumptuary laws. As this
            discipline eroded—upstarts might adopt the outward marks of their superiors—protectors
            of authority and privilege began to emphasize, in addition to outward display, (p. 88)
              interiorization of nobility and value. . . . 

          [90] The Comedy of
                Errors . . . takes as its focus the discontinuities between identities and
              the external marks that display, support, and confirm them. . . . That is, Errors stresses the marks and rituals—faces, clothing, beatings,
              warts and moles, meals, rings and gold chains—that make characters recognizable, and
              it demonstrates . . . how reliance upon this material evidence leads to unpredictable
              identity-effects. . . . Near its center is an emblem of the play’s thoroughgoing
              focus on corporeality: the grotesquely fat kitchen wench Nell, whose sweating, greasy,
              swarthy body parts Dromio of Syracuse lavishly details. . . . 

          [91] The two Antipholi and Dromios pose a kind
              of limit case: how might identity be disrupted when the public marks of that identity
              are not merely counterfeited but exactly duplicated and possessed by
                someone else? . . . Once Antipholus and Dromio’s faces can point to identities
              not their own, the play breaks the seemingly necessary correspondence between outer
              and inner character; a certain self may not necessarily take a certain shape and form.
              For a culture that places such weight on stable characterological display, the danger
              to selfhood registers in a threat both spiritual and physical.

          Why do the characters not guess that the confusions are caused by the presence of
            twins? Their blindness . . . [92] makes palpable an
              ideological blind spot within a particular kind of logic that
              governs the construction of Elizabethan identity: these characters don’t come up with
              the solution twins because, as Emilia notes, they all make the same
                sympathised one day’s error ([1887]). They assume that distinct identities are manifest in distinct marks.
              Crucial to this local logic is the role of the viewer, who recognizes
              those marks and upon whose recognition the character’s sense of identity depends.
              Shakespeare signals the importance of this confirming gaze as early as Egeon’s tragic
              tale of the shipwreck . . . [quotes 81–8].

          Sebek (1998,
            pp. 176–7), quoting 45–7: Overseas trade, in short, confounds identity, and that confusion
              takes the form of mistaken exchanges, as Antipholus of Syracuse remarks: [quotes 1184–94]. [177] The passage equates being acknowledged as oneself—being
              called by one’s name, or hailed in a social gesture, the salute—with participating in
              exchanges of various sorts: buying and selling, giving and receiving money,
              prof[f]ering and accepting invitations or expressions of gratitude for
                kindnesses previously rendered. Even the validation of physical
              existence—the measure of my body [1192]—is part of an ongoing transaction. . . . Only sorcery intruding from
              the outer (or upper) reaches . . . can account for the perplexing social exchanges
              our twin experiences. Antipholus of Syracuse and the dramatic structure of The Comedy of Errors demand that we understand commerce as a means
              of both constructing and expressing—enacting and symbolizing—identity.

          Others who discuss identity are Burelbach (1968, pp. 71–3); Uhlig (1968, pp. 450–5—see ); Soellner (1972, p. 70): But it is no accident that in
                The Comedy of Errors the identity question [864–5] is asked in its
              most impressive form by a servant, whom, according to comic convention, we cannot take
              altogether seriously. We never cease to laugh even when we feel his plight;
              Haines (1978,
            p. 113), who believes that money rather than identity is the serious matter in the play;
              Driscoll
            (1983, p. 90), a Jungian study: Shakespeare first explicitly states the theme of
              lost social identity in The Comedy of Errors when, in an
              uncharacteristically reflective moment, Antipholus of Syracuse declares: [quotes 199–200].

          Associated with anxiety about the loss of identity is the fear of transformation. Babula (1972, pp.
            26, 33): A single element that ties all of these characters is their fear of
              destructive change. He lists them, nearly all having to do with the fear of
            metamorphosis.

          (P. 33): Shakespeare has unified his play through a combination of
              change-threatening experiences at every level and the highly imaginative responses to
              those simultaneously real and illusory threats made by Aegeon and alien Antipholus on
              the highest perceptive plane. For both have felt, as the comedy made them feel, that
              to move through life is to grope through a misty dream. The Ephesians, he
            says, have rational explanations for what befalls them.

          Wyrick (1982,
            pp. 438, 443): Under his [the ass’s] shaggy skin lurks a remarkable
              ability to shift symbolic significance. The licentious ass, the
                foolish ass, and the admirable ass inhabit one
              hide. . . . 

          [443] In The Comedy of
                Errors, the ass motif has performed a variety of services. By its sheer
              iteration, it unifies the play; by its primary appeal to laughter, it helps establish
              the comic perspective at crucial points in the action; by its varying connotations, it
              aids in character delineation; by its metaphorical operation, it acts as a paradigm of
              the metamorphosis. In a broad sense, all characters are asses; in their unrelenting
              unawareness of each other’s presence in Ephesus, they form an iconographic parade of
              ignorance assembled from the pages of Ripa and Valeriano. Ultimately, however, the
              same complex of associations that informs the asinus portans mysteria emblem is at work in The Comedy
                of Errors. The ass may be foolish and licentious, his mis-takings making him
              a target of laughter, but he has been chosen to carry the reconciling promise of
              wisdom.

          Carroll (1985,
            pp. 65, 67, 72–3): The rhetoric and terminology of metamorphosis are
              everywhere overt in The Comedy of Errors, but the physical
              process itself has been carefully sidestepped: the dramatist employs instead doubling
              and an ingenious manipulation of what might be termed situational point
              of view to achieve the same effects. . . . 

          [67] Applying the language of physical change to
              interior changes becomes a modus
                operandi in The Comedy of Errors. Shakespeare
              incarnates metamorphosis within his characters in such a way that both its mysterious
              powers and skepticism about its existence are felt simultaneously. . . . [S.
              Antipholus] is . . . the stranger in a strange land. He notes the water-drop
            speech, 199–202, and its raising the question of identity. Metamorphosis
              is the quintessential loss of self, and doubling . . . offers an ironic and
              unsatisfying way of finding that lost self. The physical reunion of the separated
              twins will thus constitute only one part of a complex re-forming of the
            self.

          
            The kind of experience Antipholus of Syracuse undergoes serves as a
              model of transformation by doubling. . . . 
          

          [72] The Plautine convention rarely leads as
              deeply as Shakespeare is about to take us. He seems . . . to have rejected the basic
              assumption that identical twins are identical. For [73]
              dramatic purposes, the most important fact about identical twins is that they are and
              must be finally different. If they were completely identical,
              there would be no play. Their overwhelming similarity allows the playwright to
              construct a complex transformational situation, but only their difference allows it to
              come to dramatic life. . . . Metamorphosis appears as both change and stasis, then; it manifests itself simultaneously as being (remaining the
              same) and not-being (the metamorphosed other). . . . Like any metamorphosis, which is
              and is not, absolute identity is only asymptotically approached, and difference, the
                is not, is preserved.

          Others who treat transformation are Leggatt (1974, p. 11): S. Antipholus transformed by love,
            and Scott (1977,
            p. 115): The power of love to transform a person is the basis of an impressive
              moment in The Comedy of Errors when Antipholus of Syracuse
              met Luciana.

          The rise of interest in issues of the creation of identity and ensuing crises of
            identity in Err. has led to a branch of criticism markedly
            psychoanalytic in approach, sometimes more loosely psychological. One
            subbranch deals with the incest involved had S. Antipholus had sex with his brother’s
            wife, a taboo no longer much recognized; at the end of this section I note its biblical
            history. That these are characters in a play who have no psyches to analyze does not
            bother the practitioners.

          Feldman (1955, p. 116): The dramatist’s compassion for the
              melancholy [E.] Antipholus bears witness for our conviction that Shakespeare
              identified himself with the outraged husband. He had broken away from his own wife and
              felt a strong impulse to justify the act on the stage. It could not be shown
              straightforwardly, of course. In the first place the poet was too blind with tears of
              self-pity to see the naked truth. Moreover he sensed that his wife did not hold a
              monopoly of the guilt in their disgrace. He had the intelligence and the courage to
              admit that he had contributed wrongs and miseries to the marriage; but his courage
              took the peculiar path of confessing his sins under the mask of comedy.
            Feldman sees the play as the product of Sh.’s guilty incestuous desires for his
            mother.

          Grivelet (1969,
            pp. 15 ff.), on Molière’s Amphitryon and Err., sees Err. as based in the Oedipus complex; he
            is one of few commentators to dwell on the skirted incest in the play. The riddle of
            twins is widespread; the fact of two people indistinguishable by looks may cause
            anxiety, because of the ease with which the wrong twin might have sex with an unwitting
            wife, as Jupiter does with Alcmena in Amphitruo and as Adriana, dutiful wife though she is, narrowly escapes going to bed with the
              wrong Antipholus. And thus the case reveals itself as one . . . of potential
              incest. . . . It is easy enough to see moreover that in [16]
              the triangular relationship the real Amphitryon plays the part of a staid husband,
              already past his best, while all the illicit intoxication, the daring, the youth of
              love is on the side of Jupiter. Thus the suggestion of incest which attaches to the
              triangle points to its great archetype. As Charles Mauron says, the magic resemblance
              between two brothers modulates into the magic resemblance between father and son. You
              have . . . the inevitable Oedipus situation.

          
            The subject . . . is then a highly serious subject, rooted in the
              deepest anxieties of the human mind. And yet, in spite of its seriousness—or perhaps
              because of it—it has long proved to be particularly fit for comic
              treatment. . . . 
          

          [17] [Amphitryon and
                Err.] are remarkable instances of the ambiguity of comedy.
              They turn the deepest causes of man’s bewilderment into a joke, but it is a perilous
              balance which keeps them on the side of laughter. This uncertainty has philosophical
              implications and, moreover, they deal so explicitly with its cause that it may not be
              entirely misleading to treat them as comedies of ambiguity. . . . By ambiguity I
              simply mean man’s doubtfulness about being one or two, identical with himself or
              not. . . . 

          In The Comedy of Errors, the fun arises mostly
              from the fact that the pieces of the family puzzle, the elements of the solution, are
              all there, ready for use, in the same city of Ephesus. Only the most perverse of
              chances would bring about a fatal mistaking of identities. Our real fear is lest the
              two [sets of twins] should happen to meet and thus, by inevitable recognition, spoil
              the game. The greatest hilarity surrounds the excluding of E. Antipholus from
            his own house, bringing on the near-miss of incest between Adriana and her
            brother-in-law. (P. 18): Whether we fear more that this should happen
              than that it should not is a debatable question and, perhaps, a matter of taste. In
              any case, our comic pleasure owes much to the extreme precision and the extreme
              precariousness, to what we may call with Antipholus the sure
                uncertainty [580] of the
              equilibrium. This, I suggest, is the distinctive Shakespearian
              ambiguity. . . . 

          
            The irony is that Antipholus seems thus to be speaking the language of
              incestuous passion [to Luciana] while he is expressing his soul’s pure
                truth [824], just as Adriana is
              unwittingly wanton when she urges the same Antipholus to be true to her as a husband
              should. Virtuous words in equivocal situation. . . . The enchantment comes from
              everybody’s many-hued uncertainty about himself. . . . 
          

          
            Shakespearian comedy thrives on ambiguity ultimately
              overcome. . . . 
          

          [25] The play ends on the idea of new birth [26] mixing, not without strangeness, with that of marriage. In
              the mystic experience of love . . . man newly made overcomes his
              contradictions. . . . 

          
            But the real purpose of Shakespeare’s . . . comedy is not to offer a
              way out of ambiguity. It is much rather to face it. The escapes which they propose may
              well have mostly to do with their own obsessions. There is indeed in these escapes
              something curiously reminiscent of the terror inspired by the two tragic errors linked
              together in the Oedipus story: killing the father and marrying the mother. Which of
              the two sacrilegious deeds each dramatist found most unthinkable may be reflected in
              his attempt to turn the other alternative into a comic issue. But Shakespeare and
              Molière are at their comic best in the spirit which prompts them to laugh and make us
              laugh at our anxious fear of the great tragic doom.
          

          MacCary (1978,
            pp. 528–34): If we were to formulate a kind of comedy which would fulfill the
              demands associated with the pre-oedipal period [the child before he has learned to
              channel all his libidinal energy into the pursuit of a woman who will take the place
              of his mother], it would have many of the aspects which critics find annoying in
                The Comedy of Errors. The family would be more important
              than anyone outside the family, and the mother would be the most important member of
              the family. Security and happiness would be sought not in sexual intercourse with a
              person of the opposite sex but in reunion with or creation of a person like the person
              the protagonist would like to become, i.e., his alter ego, or, more correctly, his
              ideal ego. There would be an ambivalent attitude toward women in the play, because the
              young child (male) depends upon his mother for sustenance but fears being
              reincorporated by the mother. Such fears of the overwhelming mother might be expressed
              in terms of locked doors and bondage, but the positive nurturing mother would occasion
              concern with feasting and drinking. There might even be ambivalent situations, such as
              banquets arranged by threatening women, and ambivalent symbols, such as gold rings or
              chains, which suggest both attraction and restriction.

          If our notions of happiness are formed in childhood, then a play that has universal
            appeal will draw upon childhood experiences.

          Comedy (p. 529) should cause us to recapture, in our adult,
              intellectualized state, the sensual bliss of warmth and satiety. . . . 

          
            Clearly the comic pattern involving mistaken identity appeals to us
              because it leads from confusion about identity—our own . . . as well as the
              protagonist’s—to security.
          

          MacCary
            explores the water-drop image, 197–204. (P. 530): The water here, as
              ocean, is the overwhelming aspect of the mother, the mother from whom the child cannot
              differentiate himself. She projects to us the image of what we shall become; but it is
              a fragile image, and if we lose it we risk reintegration with her, reabsorption, a
              reversal of the process of individuation which we suffer from the sixth to the
              eighteenth month. . . . 

          As Shakespeare expands the cast and develops themes only implicit in
              the Menaechmi, he provides a complete view of the relation
              between man and wife and clearly indicates the preparation for this relation in the
              male child’s attitude toward the mother. We see the women almost entirely
            through S. Antipholus’s eyes. (P. 531): They are the dark woman (Adriana,
                atro) and the fair maid (Luciana,
                luce) we meet with so frequently in
              literature, comprising the split image of the mother, the one threatening and
              restrictive, the other yielding and benevolent.

          On the two water-drop speeches, above and 514–24 (p. 532): Most critics would
              acknowledge the central position of these two passages in the argument of the play,
              but they do not account for their effectiveness. The impact of the repetition is due
              to the reversal of the protagonist’s expectations. He came seeking his mirror image,
              like Narcissus, his ideal ego, his mother’s image of himself, and finds instead a
              woman who claims to be part of himself: and she threatens him with that absorption and
              lack of identity which he had so feared: she is the overwhelming mother. . . . In his
              speech he was the drop of water; in her speech the drop of water is let fall as an
              analogy, but he becomes again that drop of water and flees from the woman who would
              quite literally engulf him.

          
            He flees . . . to the arms of the benign Luciana. . . . This
              unthreatening, undemanding woman attracts [him], and he makes love to her in terms
              which recall the two drop of water speeches: [quotes 840–50].
          

          When Aemilia appears she scolds Adriana, telling her that she must not treat her
            husband in the threatening way she is accused of. S. Antipholus (p. 533) has finally been able to conquer his fear of losing his identity in his mother’s too
              close embrace because she herself tells him that this is no way for a woman to treat
              him: [534] [quotes 1538–51; he is hiding in the priory unable to hear
              her]. . . . [S. Antipholus] finds simultaneously the two sexual objects Freud tells
              us we all originally have: his own benevolent and protective mother and the image of
              himself in his brother he has narcissistically pursued.

          
            Psychologically it is the most satisfying ending possible, and those
              [critics] who ask for marriage here, or some guarantee that the existing marriage
              between Antipholus of Ephesus and Adriana will be revived, simply have not responded
              to the pattern of action Shakespeare has presented.
          

          MacCary is
            followed, with differences in emphasis, by Kahn (1980) and Adelman (1985), whose endnote 7 (p.
            97), explains those differences.

          Barber (1980,
            pp. 190 ff.) discusses Sh.’s intense use of the family to work out, as it were, his
            psychological relationships within his own family. He doesn’t attempt tragedy regularly
            until he has outdone his father. Shakespeare’s earlier work is shaped by a very
              strong identification with the cherishing role of the parents of early
              infancy. . . . Active male-to-male rivalry and violence is typically between
              brothers. . . . The chief source of menace, however, is in women. For behind the
              identification with maternal, cherishing attitudes, motivating it at deep levels, is
              the danger of being abandoned or overpowered. So a central preoccupation of the early
              work is with overpowering women—either being overpowered by them or overpowering
              them.

          Barber notes
            different ways of coping with the incest taboo (p. 191), which is necessarily an
              urgent problem in such family-centered art and the temperament that produced
              it. His illustrations are from Tit. but could be
            drawn from Err. as his many references to narrowly averted
            incest show.

          He has only two sentences on Err. (P. 193): He
              transforms Plautus’ libertine male comedy into a thoroughly domestic affair, ending
              with a moving family reunion presided over by a holy abbess who proves to be the
              mother. We also have the taming of a shrew, with the abbess’ assistance.

          Freedman
              (Errors, 1980, pp. 233 ff.) wants to relieve farce of its
            definition (OED) as a dramatic work (usually
              short) which has for its sole object to excite laughter. . . . 

          [237] What is of chief importance in
              understanding farce, then, is the recognition that the plot’s aggression is punitive,
              and meaningfully so—a recognition in turn dependent upon the reconstruction of the
              characters’ [238] disguised, denied transgressions.

          Turning to Err., Freedman begins an analysis that depends on three
            assertions that are either wrong or unproven. First, There has been no successful
              attempt to uncover a method to the mad confusion of the twins’ identities in the main
              plot or a reason for its envelopment by a frame plot containing their father’s woes.
              The cause of this critical standstill is a plot rife with contradictions, omissions,
              discontinuities, and disclaimers. The section on structure, , details many successful
              attempt[s] to deal with the play on other than psychoanalytic terms. Second,
            Egeon’s thousand mark ransom or fine is everywhere described as a debt
            (p. 239): Egeon’s doom is also the result of an inability to pay a debt
            (see also Freedman, Egeon’s Debt, 1980); her whole
            analysis depends on this notion. But a debt is anything . . . which one person
              is under an obligation to pay or render to another (OED, 1) and an obligation is an agreement . . . whereby a
              person . . . become[s] bound to the payment of a sum of money (OED, 2 Law); to call Egeon’s
            fine or ransom anything like an agreement, without at least arguing for
            the definition, torments the language too much, even though we speak, probably too
            loosely, of a criminal’s paying a debt to society. Third (p. 240),
              The highlight of Egeon’s story is equally a failure to return home [equal to E.
              Antipholus’s], which, while it is melodramatically presented to us as the result of
                cruel fate [there is no such phrase in the play, but see 143–4], is not the
              first such incident in his biography. It is, however, the one instance in which
              Egeon’s separation from his spouse is attributed to external forces, earlier
              separations being attributed once to business ([45–6]), and once, most significantly, to personal
              preference ([62–4]). Freedman must misread My wife, not meanely prowd of two
              such boyes, Made daily motions for our home returne: Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too
              soone we came aboord, where there is no separation in our home
              returne and no personal preference save not wanting to set sail as a family in
              Vnwilling I agreed; her citation seems not to include
              alas . . . aboord.

          Less problematic is her use of debt to describe marital
            relations; the uncited origin of the metaphor is 1 Cor. 7:3,
            which thereafter becomes almost universally employed by writers on Christian marriage;
            but the source might be acknowledged since it is central to her thesis. With these
            objections in mind, we may follow her essay.

          (P. 239): Presented with a knockabout farce obsessed with the anguish and
              punishment of unpaid debts, yet notably devoid of any significant and valid debt, we
              are led to consider the hypothesis that the play is censoring or dislocating the
              debt’s significance and validity; further, that it is this censoring activity which
              enables the play of otherwise unacceptable aggressive content associated with the
              debt. More simply, the hypothesis is that the play’s harsh confrontation and
              punishment of unpaid debts is only made acceptable, indeed humorous, by disguising and
              dislocating its content and validity. Our strategy would then be to seek possible
              points of dislocation or displacement in the pattern of debts that might lead to the
              recovery of meaning.

          On the basis of the centrality of Egeon’s debt, the play works out patterns of (p. 238)
              crime-punishment-forgiveness and
              debt-payment-redemption. . . . 

          [240] Somehow, the twins’ confrontation of
              mistaken debts, as well as their mistaken fulfillment of debts, is a means of paying a
              real debt, of working out Egeon’s redemption. The denial of the significance of the
              twins’ confrontation of debts is thus invalidated. Furthermore, were the twins not
              confronting Egeon’s actual debt, this advance from his bondage to his freedom would be
              unwarranted. We are thus left with the thesis that the validity of the twins’ debt is
              to be found in Egeon’s situation; perhaps the meaningful content of Egeon’s debt and
              the transgression associated with it may be found in the twins’ situation.

          Egeon’s real transgression was his desire to be separated from his wife—his own
              guilty wish for independence—which accounts for his eighteen-year delay in
            setting out to find her and his (p. 241) passive acceptance of a
              decidedly obscure punishment. . . . 

          
            Finally, the fact that Egeon’s initial situation couples indebtedness
              with separation from others, whereas his release from debt results in his reunion with
              his wife, also suggests that his debt is indeed marital rather than monetary. Thus
              there is a sense in which the marital debt is both significant and valid and provides
              a meaningful link between the frame plot and the main plot. Since the monetary debts
              contracted do not fulfill this condition, it seems justified to consider that they are
              a disguised expression of the marital debt and that the meaningful content of Egeon’s
              debt is disclosed in the marital debts that his sons confront.
          

          The twins are symbolic functions of two sides of Egeon. (P. 242): Antipholus of Ephesus is quite literally the part of Egeon that has remained lost
              with his wife since the storm finally separated the couple; Antipholus of Syracuse is
              that part of Egeon that has remained with him. Antipholus of Ephesus is married to a
              demanding wife, as his father was long ago, while Antipholus of Syracuse is a
              bachelor, as Egeon is now. . . . 

          
            The play, then, is not simply about the payment of debts or the physical
              division and reunion of a family, but about the psychic division and integration of a
              personality, the reintegration of a long-denied part of oneself through psychological
              payment as well. That the path to the integration of Egeon’s personality should
              involve the mistaken identification of single and married twins with
              each other may seem immediately less problematic. That the miraculous
              recovery of Egeon’s past marital [243] identity depends upon
              the mistaken confrontation of marital debts may also seem more logical.
              The farcical misunderstandings of identity, the absurd series of debts directed at the
                wrong man, are not as nonsensical as they first appear. The two
              actions are one; the errors no errors at all.
          

          Freedman
              (Egeon’s Debt, 1980) repeats much of the preceding essay. One
            problem in this essay is the paucity of quotation, which leads to the reader’s not
            always recognizing the context (p. 371): Antipholus of Syracuse no sooner enters
              Ephesus than he is led by the device of mistaken identities to believe he has lost all
              his money. Having just learned of the precarious state of Syracusans in Ephesus,
              Antipholus of Syracuse fears that he will incur the debt which, unknown to him, his
              father has contracted. His financial situation is no sooner clarified than he is
              mistakenly accused of marital neglect by his sister-in-law, Adriana, who claims of him
              the obligations of husband to wife. The substitution of marital for monetary
              indebtedness is significant; it leads to the first possibility of redemption in the
              play. Antipholus of Syracuse follows Adriana to his brother’s home, where he is
              promised a full dinner and Adriana’s forgiveness. This is a plausible account
            of parts of 1.2 and 2.2, but one looks in vain for S. Antipholus’s fear that he will
            likewise incur the debt that has been assessed Egeon (indeed, his failure
            to wonder about the Syracusian Marchant at 165 is odd) or for Adriana’s promise of
              forgiveness, though it is implied in shrive you (604). This essay emphasizes various levels of
            redemption and reconciliation, especially citing Eph. 2:14–3:1
            as one more significant passage linking the Epistle and the play.

          Less purely psychoanalytic is Nevo (1980), who is the first to use Lacan’s mirror stage,
            which is later elaborated by Adelman (1985) and others; on 1909–10 (p. 34): The whole little episode is a
              deliciously comic forerunner of a Lacanian stade
                du miroir.

          Novy (1981, p.
            321): In the comedies, the conflicts between emotional distance and control do
              not require death for their resolution. Thus the distance between parent and child is
              often presented largely as geographic distance and physical disguise. . . . In The Comedy of Errors, [S.] Antipholus speaks movingly of his
              separation from his parents [sic: his mother and brother], caused by the romance plot
              conventions of tempest and shipwreck. Here, and in the romances as well, such
              externally enforced family separation could dramatize the frequent separation of
              Elizabethan families by death and standard child-rearing practices. Feeling separation
              as rejection probably alternated with feeling it as beyond human control like tempest
              and shipwreck. The reticence that the Antipholus brothers keep in their reunion—they
              never speak directly to each other—may show that the ideal of emotional control
              continues its claims even at the happy ending. At the corresponding point, the
              Menaechmi twins . . . speak to each other with feeling, and we might expect even more
              eloquence at the father-son reunion not found in the source, but we do not get it.
              This inarticulacy allows the actors to fill in with gestures, of course, and the
              audience with imagination; nevertheless it is interesting that it is the mother who
              has almost all the words of joy at the resolution, and that her imagery turns on
              childbirth [quotes 1890–2].

          Adelman (1985,
            pp. 73–6, 93–5) is concerned with a male identity that locates itself
              via bonding with another man and recognizes in women a disturbance to the bond and to
              the identity so constituted. . . . 

          
            We ordinarily think of Shakespearean comedy as characterized by its
              ending in a marriage, or at least in the promise of a marriage, that will resolve the
              tensions of the plot as it marks the passing of the hero and heroine from childlike
              dependence on their old family unit to the establishment of new adult identities in
              the formation of a new family unit. . . . 
          

          [74] In The Comedy of
                Errors, marriage is so incidental to the prime business of the play that the
              normally talkative Luciana is allowed no response to Antipholus of Syracuse’s rather
              off-hand marriage proposal at the play’s end; its part in the joyful resolution is
              insignificant in comparison with the reunion of the broken family. Furthermore, the
              play’s rather meager promise of a happy marriage for one twin is more than balanced by
              its full demonstration of the unharmonious marriage of the other
            twin. . . . 

          [75] The love plot of The
                Comedy of Errors cannot be sorted out until Antipholus of Syracuse finds out
              in the most literal way who he isn’t. . . . 

          
            For despite the implicit assertion of the comic pattern that sees
              conflict in generational terms, we do not move directly from family bonds to marriage
              without an intervening period in which our friendships with same-sex friends help us
              to establish our independent identities; and marriage is notoriously disruptive of
              these friendships and sometimes of the identities based on them. This double movement
              is perfectly embodied in The Comedy of Errors and The Two Gentle­[76]men of Verona: taken together, they begin to suggest
              the full complexity of the pattern in which male identity is achieved by merger with a
              mirror self and then threatened by women.
          

          
            The Comedy of Errors explores the first part of
              this pattern almost diagrammatically. Antipholus of Syracuse tells us that he loses
              himself in his quest to find his mother and brother ([204]); but the action of the play argues that he can find
              himself only by so losing himself. In the course of the play, he is robbed of those
              external assurances by which identity is normally confirmed and begins to doubt even
              the self-identification of his own memory; his identity is assured only at the
              unravelling that occurs when he and his twin are finally face to face. His identity at
              this moment is contingent upon himself in a mirroring other, a process that Dromio of
              Ephesus makes clear when he says to his own twin, [quotes 1909–10]. Identity here develops
              precisely out of the tension between self and other, only in the presence of the
              mirroring twin who is both self and other. 
          

          
            But such an identity borders perilously on fusion. . . . The comedy
              depends throughout on just such a tension [quotes 199–200] between separation and
              fusion, so that we are always struggling to see which twin is which as we unravel the
              plot. In fact the end of the play emphasizes the process by which identity is created
              out of a state of undifferentiated fusion. Everyone on stage assumes for a dizzying
              moment that the two Antipholuses are in fact one—which is the natural man, /
                And which the spirit ([1818–19])—and the remaining action discovers who is who
              only by a sometimes tedious insistence on the separateness of events, in effect
              separating out the identities from the fused mirror-images by detailing what has
              happened to whom. This insistence is unnecessary for the audience, who already knows
              the plot, but apparently necessary for the fantasy about identity embedded here: for
              the recounting of events already familiar to the audience seems to ward off the danger
              that the twins, who discover themselves in the mirror relationship, will simply fuse.
              If Comedy is thus about the tenuousness of identity, it
              leaves us with a radical image of the frail arena of the self: for the twins must be
              separated out from one another to know who they are; and yet they can know who they
              are only by seeing themselves mirrored in one another. . . . 
          

          [93] In The Comedy of
                Errors . . . the recovery of male bonds is suggestively associated with the
              return of the mother, as though the two are necessarily simultaneous, or at bottom
              one. The simultaneity of this recovery is I think behind Shakespeare’s rather odd
              impulse to join the Menaechmi with the story of Apollonius of
              Tyre. . . . At the start, Antipholus of Syracuse claims to be searching for both
              brother and mother, and although the search for the mother is forgotten . . . her
              return in the surprise ending perfectly satisfies the longings suggested by
              Antipholus’s initial description of the hopelessness of his search [199–204]. . . . From the point of
              view of a drop of water, it presumably does not much matter whether one fuses with
              another drop or with an ocean: either failing to find or finding entails loss of
              self. . . . Antipholus’s logic works to suggest that finding the drop should
              forestall the larger fusion; but the metaphor itself belies this logic. . . . For the
              search to find oneself in brother and mother is also a search for fusion in which the
              self will be lost.

          
            We may begin to understand the force of this fusion both feared and [94] desired if we locate Antipholus’s metaphoric speech in its
              imagined point of literal embodiment in the play. The initial description of the
              splitting of each pair of twins, and of the parents, during their sea voyage gives us
              a cataclysmic image of oceanic divorce ([107]) that seems clearly the emotional foundation for
              Antipholus’s metaphor of the self confounded in the ocean. But at the same time, this
              cataclysmic image allows us to understand the desire for fusion inherent in
              Antipholus’s watery metaphor. For the sea-splitting is in part a re-imagining of the
              divorce of birth itself, a fearful birth felt not as individuation but as
              incompletion. . . . Antipholus’s desire to find his twin—his desire for the fusion of
              one drop with another—is the desire to undo the violent sea-splittings that initiate
              the wanderings, the errors, of the play. In that sense, the starting point for the
              play’s insistence on the search for the split-off mirror self is the radical sense of
              separation from the mother. . . . Hence the power of Antipholus’s desire for fusion
              and the plot-magic by which the recovery of the twin-self dissolves into the recovery
              of the mother. Hence too the utter appropriateness with which the Abbess redefines
              birth itself by associating the recovery of her children, with their birth, with the
              long-awaited parturition: [quotes 1890–2]. . . . 
          

          
            The condensation in The Comedy of Errors of the
              search for the mirroring self and the search for the mother may allow us to
              understand . . . the force of male bonding in Shakespeare’s works. . . . For the
              mirror relationship is . . . transitional: it allows for a new sense of self based on
              separateness from the mother while maintaining the fluidity of the boundaries between
              self and other characteristic of that first relationship. In that sense it offers
              protection against engulfment by the mother while allowing for the comforts of the
              union. Both the desire for fusion and the protection offered by the mirror
              relationship are perfectly captured by the illogic of Antipholus’s metaphor of the
              drops and the ocean: in his imagination, fusion with the other identical drop will
              somehow prevent fusion with the mother-ocean. For the male bond protects against total
              fusion with the mother by replicating the early mother-child relationship with a
              difference—replicating it not in its choice of object but [95]
              in its choice of mode: not by choosing a woman who can then be imaginatively linked
              with the mother, as in Troilus and Cressida or Othello, but by choosing a twin-self with whom one can be
              fused.
          

          Kahn (1980, pp.
            217–25): Shakespeare rarely portrays masculine selfhood without
              suggesting a filial context for it. . . . It goes without saying that Shakespeare
              depicts all his women characters as sisters, daughters, wives, or mothers. . . . Yet,
              at the same time, an intense ambivalence toward the family runs through Shakespeare’s
              works, taking the familiar shape of conflicts between inheritance and individuality
              and between autonomy and relatedness. . . . Characters must break out of their
              families in order to grow up, and when they have founded families of their own, they
              must learn both to accept and then to let go of their children. . . . 

          
            I will set the Shakespearean quest for masculine selfhood in the context
              of the family and the life cycle. From the beginning of his career to the end,
              Shakespeare sought a dramatic and psychological strategy for dealing not only with our
              common ambivalence toward our families but specifically with the male passage from
              being a son to being a father. He found it through the romance, in one of its [218] typical patterns of action that I shall call the
                providential tempest. [Err., TN, Per., WT, Tmp.] all . . . depict the separation of family members in a
              literal or metaphorical tempest; the resulting sorrow and confusion; and the ultimate
              reunion of the family, with a renewed sense of identity or rebirth for its members.
              This pattern is that of a journey, and it suggests a passage through time as well as
              through space—the individual’s passage from emotional residence within the family to
              independence and adulthood. As depicted . . . the tempest and shipwreck initiating
              the main action represent the violence, confusion, and even terror of passing from one
              stage of life to the next, the feeling of being estranged from a familiar world and
              sense of self without another to hang onto. . . . 
          

          Reading these five plays as a group, we watch a process of identity
              formation highlighted in two significantly related crises: that of the youth emerging
              from the family, more than a child but still not a man, and that of the father who has
              not yet fully accepted his fatherhood.
            Kahn cites Erik
            Erikson on identity formation, when in adolescence the instinctual and social
              pressures for intimacy with the opposite sex and pressures to form a stable
            line of work and way of life produce a crisis, forcing the individual back into the
            family, into the identifications of the early, preoedipal stage of ego building.
              In effect, the adolescent reexperiences separation and individuation, but not solely
              through his mother.

          She also refers to Peter Blos, who says that adolescence is characterized by mourning
            for the loss of the (p. 219) strongest love [the adolescent] has known thus far,
              his love for his parents. In his mourning, he identifies with them, or
              one of them. But he does this indirectly, by merging narcissistically with persons who
              can mirror him as that parent once did. In effect, he recapitulates the symbiotic
              merger with the mother preceding individuation, leading in stages to
              the search for a heterosexual object [characterized] by an overwhelming hunger
              for a love object of the same sex, in which the real identity of the object, the
              parent of the same sex, is denied. Whether it is positive or negative, identification
              with this same-sex object is necessary, as part of the mourning process, before
              heterosexual love can exist. It is this process of mourning the loss of the parent by
              identification, and finding a new object of love after working through the
              identification, that The Comedy of Errors and Twelfth Night depict.

          Further points she makes: Psychoanalytic discussions of doubling are indebted to Freud
            and Rank. For Freud the double is (p. 220) uncanny, a
              mental representation of something familiar and homelike but [also] secret, strange,
              and sinful—a representation . . . of our earliest sexual feeling and wishes with
              regard to our parents, which we later perceive as guilty, repress, and
              hide. . . . 

          [221] Freud and Rank also stress the double’s
              power to bind the hero to his oedipal past in another way. The double . . . is a
              potential death bringer, a projection of the castrating oedipal father, while at the
              same time it represents the hero’s beloved, narcissistically overestimated self. The
              double makes the hero’s life a torment, but the hero’s life also depends on the
              double’s existence.

          In Err. the twin preserves a link with the past but also helps
            the other twin find a mate and so make a break. S. Antipholus seeks his brother,
            grieving for the loss, but through the mistaken identity finds Luciana.

          
            But in their searching and grieving, Antipholus S. and Viola are both regressing
              to the earliest stage of identity formation: identification with one perceived as
              being the same as oneself.
          

          Sh. changes names from Menaechmus (she neglects Sosicles) (p. 222) to
              Antipholus, from the Greek anti
              + philos: love against or
              opposed to, citing Foakes (ed. 1962, p. 2: Antipholus appears to stem from the
              Greek Antiphilos, listed as a proper name for a lover in H. Estienne
              [Stephanus], Thesaurus Græcae Linguae [1572], but we do not
              know where Shakespeare found it.) As each character is introduced, we
              see that he feels uprooted and alienated from himself because he has lost the
                other closest to him. (This uprooting, it may be objected, is
            not true of anyone but S. Antipholus.) Luciana (p. 223) would drown him, but she
              will rescue him, save him. Metaphorically, she will save him from that obliteration of
              self, that inauthentic metamorphosis into another person, which her sister promised:
                [224] [quotes 832–6]. Likewise with S. Dromio’s parody,
            861–936: Dromio’s fears of being lost in Luce prove contagious; by the end of Act
              III, Antipholus S. regards Luciana as a mermaid luring him to death by
              drowning.

          Possession by spirits is the third metaphor for the loss of ego identity. Dr. Pinch’s
            exorcisms are in vain. The real deliverance from the bonds of error is by angelic
              power. Pauline word play runs through the scenes focusing on Antipholus E.’s arrest;
              mistakenly and to no avail, he seeks deliverance from the sargeant’s bonds with the
              coins—angels—which will pay his debt [she refers to Acts 12].
              These echoes of Paul’s miraculous deliverance from prison prepare us for the
              denouement at the abbey, wherein the evil powers of Lapland sorcerers and Circe’s cup
              show themselves to be providence in disguise.

          Emphasis on time shows the development of identity as process rather than a
              fixed state. . . . [225] Emilia’s final lines firmly link this
              sense of time with a sense of identity as growth in time—the serious and realistic
              theme underlying the farce: [quotes 1890–2].

          Berry’s (1985,
            pp. 34–43) is a Jungian reading: [Err.] is
              rooted in the collective subconscious, and archetypes of enduring power are presented.
              The plot itself is a playful rendering of the hostile brother motif. . . . Here, [35] the brothers are unwitting not hostile; it is only through
              ignorance that Antipholus of Syracuse intrudes upon his brother’s domain. The
              Syracusan appears, archetypally, to be the younger brother; he is
              defensive, apprehensive, easily daunted (but luckier, for all that). . . . The
                elder brother is passionate, overbearing, a fighter. This mutuality
              of temperament is a part of the psychic integration of the play. Then again, Luciana
              provides perhaps the clearest statement in Shakespeare of the anima archetype. [Quotes
                850–3.] She, for
              Antipholus, is the embodiment of this omnipresent and ageless image &lt;of
                woman&gt; which corresponds to the deepest reality in man [quoting Jung,
                Aion]. The final transformation of the anima is the Abbess,
              who also combines the functions of Great Mother and Wise Old Man. . . . 

          [37] The Comedy of
                Errors is organized along two lines of psychic advance. One is that of
              erotic promise, unbelievable good fortune, discovered identity, the fulfilment of all
              one’s desires. The other is that of loss, shattered identity, pain. The first line is
              stronger, and its triumph never really in doubt. The second is always present, often
              uppermost, at all times shadowing the experience of cast and audience. Threat and
              promise make up the fantasies of this play, and we ought to catch at their blurred
              shapes.

          These include S. Antipholus’s fear of foreigners in 263–8, 575–81. (P. 38): The archetypal
              challenge to self comes from strangers and the echoes of a fairy world (584–5, 608–9, 611–12): There is the house,
              there is the fair witch, offering whatever inducement of gingerbread or blandishment
              that can tempt the hero—or victim.

          Amphitruo dramatizes (p. 39) a primal fear in
            the locking out of the rightful husband while his double makes love to Alcmena; some of
            Shakespeare’s audience would get that allusion. But everyone would receive the
              impression of sexual congress behind locked doors. . . . Adriana is clearly in a mood
              to charm her husband, and is insistent that they are not to be
              disturbed: [quotes 602–7]. The audience is now to be teased with a sexual fantasy,
            confirmed by the bawdry of Are you there, wife? You might have come
              before ([710–11]), Your cake here is warm within ([725]), It would make a man mad as a buck to be so
              bought and sold [727–8]. See n. 727 on whether
            this is certainly bawdry. The audience, he says, believes that the sex has occurred,
            despite his quoting of Adriana’s parting Come sister, Dromio play the Porter well [which might add exhibitionism and
            voyeurism to the proceedings]. E. Antipholus likewise supposes that he has been
            cuckolded, hence makes plans for (p. 40) a sexual revenge with the
            Courtesan, depending on Ile knocke else-where, to see if they’ll
              disdaine me (782): Knocking is standard slang for sexual entry. But above all, the
              double-entendres and bawdry of the text stem from the stage symbolism itself: the
              house, perceived from earliest times as the coding for woman, and the knocking at the
              gates, the male attempts at entry. The symbolism is the more charged if the nature of
              the inner action is considered. What is held before the audience as a theatrical possibility is incest. . . . Here in III.i, at the
              midpoint of The Comedy of Errors, incest is the compelling
              fantasy which is held before the audience as a likely reality. It is the dark centre
              of a play shot with fitful visions. Has it happened?

          No, it has not, since in the next scene Luciana upbraids S.
            Antipholus for not performing (p. 41) a husband’s office (788). Berry is one of the few critics who notice the
            church’s prohibition of sexual intercourse with one’s sister-in-law. In any event, the
            audience is quickly comforted out of its brief anxiety. The real message, which
              is one of reassurance, has come earlier through numerous channels.

          Other elements of comfort are the insistence on money and gold in its specifically
            English terminology of (p. 42) angel and sixpence, part of
            the idea of the foreign at home which is basic to
              this play. . . . 

          
            England signifies reassurance. . . . Typically
              of The Comedy of Errors, its playing with primal anxieties is
              accompanied by signals of primal comfort.
          

          Even so, the later phases . . . handle archetypes of serious and
              compelling authority, including language involving purgatory, hell,
            deliverance (p. 43) (the bark Expedition [1220] that S. Antipholus cannot get to and the devil’s
              dam [1234], the Courtesan).
              Hell, however comically rendered, is the motif of Act IV. It is a nightmare, a
              bondage from which the captive actors struggle to be free.

          Freedman (1991,
            pp. 80 ff.) abandons her two earlier attempts to find unity in the play’s
              patterns of crime-punishment-forgiveness and debt-payment-redemption [that]
              assert narrative logic, making Err. a play unified by
            an allegorical structure: Since we have been unable to find a means of uniting
              these plots—and yet we sense their connection—our own readings display this sense of
              uncanny connections anticipated and yet denied. . . . The project of reading The Comedy of Errors reveals how the identity of the literary
              work, like the identity of the subject, is uncanny precisely because
                of its awareness of its failure to capture awareness. . . . A full
              articulation of the play’s levels of self-awareness is impossible—and this may well be
              the point.

          She enrolls herself among those who have performed (p. 83) elaborate New
              Critical studies of complex themes and patterns of imagery to find unity where
            there is none to be found.

          (P. 84): To read The Comedy of Errors in this way is to
              acknowledge the sway of the uncanny in our lives. It is to acknowledge that, insofar
              as we cannot avoid the principle of errors the play articulates, we can never hope to
              read the play correctly.

          She reads the play in various ways—New Critical, deconstructionist, and so on—to show
            how for every explanation there is a counterexplanation that exposes the inadequacy of
            the reader as well as the uncertainty of the play. Her denial that anyone has been able
            to find a way to unify the play (how can the Egeon plot and the mistakes plot be
            harmonized, as they must be if the play is to be honored as more than a farce?) means
            only that she is not satisfied by earlier successes. And her lack of quotation in favor
            of summary, noted above, continues (p. 86): We no sooner consider ourselves
              superior in awareness to the twin Antipholi than we recall that these
                masters imagine themselves superior to their wives, who in turn enjoy
              superiority over their servants, who in turn feel superior to their
              women. That the play does not have these plural relationships undercuts the
            force of her argument.

          Enterline
            (1995, pp. 191, 195, 200–1, 204–6, 209, 224–5): In Err.
            Shakespeare vacillates between presenting the self as an acquired and as
              an inherent property. This ambiguous self . . . is caught up in specifically
              linguistic dilemmas that require an enormous amount of social vigilance to keep in
              order. . . . 

          [195] The Comedy of
                Errors suggests that from the first Shakespeare confronts the
                self as a transpersonal and social, rather than an individual,
              construction. . . . Strictly speaking, Antipholus of Syracuse achieves a stable sense
              of self, and a name proper to it, as a consequence of finding his mirroring fellow: his identity, such
              as it is, is an effect of doubling rather than given before such
              reduplication. . . . 

          [200] In The Comedy of
                Errors, the self is a self-reflexive entity that knows itself only through
              absence, loss, and a differential relationship with an other
              fellow from its inception. This [water-drop] soliloquy alerts the
              audience to expect that Antipholus’s accumulating sense of self-loss in relation to
              others will be the error that Act V will correct when he finds a
                mother and a [201] brother. The comedy solves
              the errors of identity by providing him with a place next to his twin, in front of the
              community, so that everyone can give back to him an identity he accepts as his
              own. . . . 

          [204] The language of dispersion in Antipholus’s
              first soliloquy about being an unseen
              drop of water in the ocean and the [205]
              resonances of wandering in the error of the
              title indicate, as does Lacan, that when the subject identifies with its mirrored
              other, the act of identification provides a visual structure, a framework for the
              inchoate body’s spatial coordination.

          The agent for discovering identity is the mother Aemilia who verifies as other the
            child’s recognition of himself in the mirror. (P. 206): What matters is less what
              she says [mighty Duke, behold a man much wronged
                (1813–14)]—since
              no one subject in the play knows the answer until such knowledge is
              produced by the moment of the twins’ pairing—than the mere fact of
                her presence. Her act of bringing the Syracusan twin on stage with his
              mirroring brother . . . begins to set the morning story right ([1832]).

          Reestablishing an ordered identity for both sets of twins requires an (p. 209)
              imposition of hierarchical subordination in S. Antipholus’s I am
              your master, Dromio (1903). But
            the Dromios subvert that resolution. The other brothers do not joyfully speak to each
            other as lost fellows as their servants do. They avoid the mirrored relationship
              between fellows, and thus the dialectical fictions producing the identity that
              Antipholus of Syracuse once sought in order to find himself. This evasion, I propose,
              occurs because the Dromios reveal that the mirroring exchange is a never-ending
              process rather than a closed book.

          She observes that Adriana is deprived of female subjectivity by being rebuked for her
            assertiveness by both Luciana and Aemilia. (P. 224): The subtexts . . . combine
              the play’s dual interest in the chaste mother of the nuclear family and the
              controlling framework of male narcissism—a shaping projection of the self based on the
              model of the male body that organizes its own version of loving sameness as the
              generous sharing of him selfe. The play’s ordering of marital relations
              revolves around subtexts that insist on female chastity [Aemilia’s becoming a nun] and
              on a wife’s meriting esteem as part of one flesh only if she is
              obedient to her husband’s self and body. It is in the context of this
              symmetrical, shaping masculine self-love that I [225] would
              situate the language of the final scene: such a self requires a
              mother-turned-nun who inhabits and is herself a special place, a
                sanctuary where errant identity stops wandering or running
              about. . . . But she can become this guarantor or sanctuary for a speaking male
              identity only by being purged of any taint of sexuality.

          Modern readers may be puzzled as to why the question of incest appears at all, since
            sleeping with one’s brother’s wife has long since lost its taboo, though not its status
            as adultery. The OED definition, The crime of sexual
              intercourse or cohabitation within the degrees within which marriage is
              prohibited, has as its last citation one dated 1868, and the phrase
              within the degrees blurs the old canon law statements of degrees of
            consanguinity and of affinity (relation by marriage). Canon law in Sh.’s day, and for
            long thereafter, prohibited a man’s marrying his deceased (or
            divorced) brother’s wife; thus by definition S. Antipholus commits incest if he has
            intercourse with Adriana. This prohibition is based on Lev. 18,
            which forbids intercourse outside of marriage in this relationship. A Table of
            Prohibited Degrees was published in 1563 by Archbishop Parker and became Canon 99 in
            1603, which specifically says that such marriages are incestuous. See n.
              651–745.

        





        
          Family and Marriage

          Gervinus
            (1849–50; 1863, 1:187–9): To avoid the improbabilities found in the
              sources from which he drew, is everywhere else an effort, which characterizes most
              strictly Shakespeare’s knowledge of human nature; here, in the plot of the play, there
              is hardly a trace of this effort to be found. . . . 

          
            But what is missing of skilful management in respect to this plot,
              scarcely weighs in the balance, when we see, how the poet has given to the whole
              extravagant matter of these mistakes and intricacies, an inner relation to the
              character of the family in which he placed them. These comic [188] parts appear upon a thoroughly tragic background, which indeed interferes
              not at all with the extravagant scenes in the fore-ground, perhaps only makes them the
              more conspicuous, but yet every moment appears with sufficient importance to keep
              under the superficial and weak impression of a mere farce, of which the kernel as well
              as the shell consisted in the mistakes of these similar twins. . . . We look upon a
              double family, and its earlier and present destinies, in which the most peculiar
              errors take place, not merely of an external, but of an internal character. In this
              family lie together the strange contrasts of domestic love and a roving spirit; these
              produce alternate happiness and misfortune, and occasion troubles and quarrels, in
              spite of inner congeniality of soul and family attachment, and estrangement and
              perplexity in spite of outward similarity. . . . [189] The
              inducement for this journey [Æmilia’s joining Egeon], the poet has left as a matter of
              conjecture; only so far has he indicated, that if a loving, it was also a wilful
              step. . . . Was it the result of suspicion and jealousy . . . ? We should think so;
              for this Æmelia can subsequently preach to her daughter-in-law with such forcible
              warning against this passion. . . . A lively impulse works in them [Egeon and S.
              Antipholus], as in the mother before, to unite the family, and this very impulse
              separates them ever more, and threatens at length to separate them forcibly and for
              ever.
          

          Holzknecht
            (1950, p. 252): Heartache in comedy only makes more great the joy of its removal.
              Ægeon’s hard luck . . . may have either of two ends; we have little doubt as to which
              it will be as we watch the play. But the misfortunes of Ægeon’s family and the
              death-sentence which hangs over him form a dark framework for the bright, variegated
              colors of the farcical misfortunes in the mix-ups of the twins.

          Scott (1982, p.
            4): Shakespeare in this farce is not greatly concerned with what we now might see
              as the absurdists’ metaphysical ethic, but his dramatic score . . . does employ
              similar vacuous activities in order to illustrate the loneliness of man devoid of
              roots whether they be in the context of father, mother, brother or wife. The
              individual’s separation from the family is his absurdity and it is this which finds
              central expression in the play’s portrayal of the Antipholus of Ephesus–Adriana
              relationship.

          Slights (1993,
            pp. 4–5, 13–15, 22–3): My object is to explore how the ten comedies from
                The Comedy of Errors through Twelfth
                Night represent the problems and satisfactions of people living together in
              an ordered commonwealth. . . . 

          
            The emphasis on the individual psyche in criticism since the nineteenth
              century is unsurprising given the predominance in Western thought of the notion of the
              autonomous individual existing apart from any social role or function. From this
              perspective, the Renaissance was a crucial period in the transition from a medieval,
              static view of people as defined by their social roles to a [5]
              new view of people able to fulfill themselves, unhampered by historical limitations.
              But we should not impose on the Renaissance a modern idea of individual autonomy that
              assumes a personal identity apart from and prior to all social roles.
          

          She keys her study to Donne’s sermon on Eph. 5:25–7 (in Sermons, ed. Potter Simpson, 1962, 5:113–29, preached at an undated
            christening) (P. 13): Preaching on Ephesians 5 . . . Donne offers an analysis of the essential nature of all
              human societies since the birth of Eve’s first son: from that beginning to the
                end of the world, these three relations, of Master and Servant, Man and Wife, Father and Children,
                have been, and ever shall be the materialls, and the elements of all society, of
                families, and of Cities, and of Kingdomes. Whether or not all societies of
              all times consist of these three relationships, as Donne alleges, The
                Comedy of Errors does. . . . 

          [14] The play as a whole treats human [15] society not as divinely ordained but as practically
              necessary. The misadventures of Shakespeare’s hapless twins occur in a world where
              human society is a necessary protection against the harsh conditions of physical
              existence. Egeon’s family is dispersed by natural violence.

          Although Egeon protests that the world of physical nature is unjust and
              merciless, he does not perceive it as random or chaotic. He registers no surprise or
              awe at the ocean storm that began his misfortune, recalling matter-of-factly: [quotes
                66–8]. As the
              waves obeyed the wind, so the people in their makeshift boat were obedient to
                the stream ([89]) until the more
              powerful sun dispersed the storm and calmed the seas. Egeon assumes that the physical
              world follows its own laws by which the inferior is obedient to the superior.
            Everyone survived, establishing stable lives. In an orderly society people can
              protect themselves and establish control over nature. Thus when Egeon’s search for his
              family brings him to Ephesus, he defers without protest to Ephesian authority.
            Solinus sentences him, not from tyrannical power, but by application of the law.

          The comic mistakings are located in this social world, as are the losses of identity
            when the individual is separated from society, as in S. Antipholus’s drop of water
            speech (199–202). (P.
            22): A complex picture of the strength and fragility of the human
              relationships that constitute society emerges from these confusions. The complications
              of plot pit the individual characters’ sense of themselves as unique and irreplaceable
              against their dependence on other people for their sense of who they are and against
              the fact that to other people they are indistinguishable from each
              other. . . . 

          [23] The Comedy of
                Errors presents the tension between the characters’ sense of uniqueness and
              their dependence on precarious social identities as both terrifying and
              absurd.

          The debate between the sisters on the wife’s equality with her husband leads to
            extended comment. Dusinberre (1975, pp. 78–80, 82–3, 102–3) sees the debate as part of
            the Reformation’s argument that the old doctrine of a wife’s subservience accorded ill
            with the obligations of matrimony: When the Puritans set themselves to
              change the old idea of male authority over women, they carried with them the
              dramatists, already nourished on a Renaissance fascination with the whole question of
              authority and the individual.

          
            It is not surprising that Luciana answered her sister with a
              philosophical rather than a theological argument. The theological basis for women’s
              subjection had been persistently queried and discredited throughout the sixteenth
                century. . . . [79] The household was the microcosm of the
              State, and women’s subjection a happy paradigm of civil order.
          

          But the official position of obedience is found in the Homily Concerning Good Order and
            Obedience to Rulers and Magistrates, where wives are part of a comprehensive list of
            those who must show obedience, lest chaos return again. (P. 80): Luciana
              describes to Adriana what the queen wished every subject to know, that subjection to
              authority is part of the divinely appointed order of Nature: [quotes 289–99]. . . . 

          [82] Adriana retorts to her sister that she is
              not married—nor, with sisterly acid, likely to be. . . . Adriana knew that her
              question [see 284] about liberty was worth
              a better answer. If women were spiritually equal to men the questions about their
              subjection would have . . . to be rephrased, and this is exactly what the Puritans
              set themselves to do in their sermons and domestic conduct books. . . . 

          [83] The Puritans reached the conclusion that
              marriage worked best if a wife offered her husband voluntary submission out of, and in
              return for, love; but on the way there they opened a Pandora’s box of suggestion. A
              husband could not expect the gift of submission regardless of his own
              behaviour. . . . 

          [102] Unity, in Puritan eyes, conferred on man
              and wife an equal division of labour. Both are responsible as individuals for their
              joint identity as a couple. Adriana attacks her husband for a way of life he would not
              tolerate in her. He has divided the sacred union between them: [quotes 514–18, 525–33, 535–41]. [103] Her ideology is the one which determined the Puritan attack
              on the double standard.

          McKewin (1980,
            pp. 117 ff.) sees intimate conversations between women as an activity where women
              can consider the relationship between the feminine decorum espoused by their society
              and their own impulses to break free. . . . The sheer theatrical pleasures of these
              exchanges, from Adriana and Luciana’s argument about wifely virtue to the
            conference about sex between Anne Bullen and the old woman in H8, attest to Shakespeare’s enduring mimetic skill in creating the
              sound of women’s voices placing themselves in a man’s world.

          Most of these scenes (p. 121) explore the possibilities and limits of women’s
              action, often leading indirectly to it. . . . In other plays, the dialectic between
              the is and the ought of a woman’s experience is resolved
              less peacefully than in TGV
              2.7.64. In The Comedy of Errors, Adriana punches
              holes in her maiden sister Luciana’s theory of the patient wife. Having suffered
              through the practice of a wandering husband, Adriana mocks the woman who knows only
              the clichés of the code ([284–315]). Here conversation becomes an acceptable form of protest that
              ultimately socializes the two women: Adriana releases much of her anger within the
              boundaries of the counter-universe; Luciana learns a lesson that prepares her for a
              future role.

          
          Jardine (1983,
            pp. 44 ff.) incorrectly describes the midday lock-out scene (see n. 651–745) and continues, [E.
              Antipholus] promptly retires to a house of ill-repute, bestows a costly present
              intended for his wife on his whore, and ultimately threatens to horsewhip Adriana. The
              audience’s reactions to Adriana’s pro­[45]testation at her
              ill-treatment can only . . . be hilarity; it is all so appalling, so much like a
              travesty of ordinary domestic relations that the speeches become set pieces for a male
              audience’s amusement: [quotes 505–23]. Adriana’s husband is in fact estranged from
              her; does, in fact, look more kindly on his mistress than on her; does tear himself
              from her. But the man to whom this speech is addressed is not in fact her husband. And
              what follows underscores the heavy irony that, because Adriana so dutifully pursues
              matrimonial accord in the face of all her husband’s negative efforts,
              she finds herself currently, unbeknownst to herself but to the amusement of the
              audience, hotly pursuing an adulterous relationship.

          Of Luciana’s counseling clandestine adultery (787–801) (p. 46): Antipholus is here being
              upright in the face of immense provocation (Adriana would have had him seduce her
                qua husband in the previous scene).
              And now Luciana upbraids him in terms of matrimonial apologetics: deceive your wife if
              you must, but do it decently, covertly. Antipholus’s open courting of her is in fact
              honesty; his refusal of aggressive sexual advance on the part of Adriana positively
              heroic.

          
            The only redress the wife has against entirely customary behaviour on
              her husband’s part is to resort to the customary appeals for decorum. Any action she takes results in (comic) indecorousness on her own
              part. And this . . . captures fairly accurately the actual (and actually far from
              comic) helplessness of the wife in a liberalised marriage which laid strong emphasis
              on dialogue between partners, but continued . . . to treat articulateness in women as
              unseemly and unreliable. Liberal theory encourages the partner-wife to speak her mind;
              illiberal tradition, on the look out for signs of female [47]
              disruptiveness, reduces her to a silence which renders her more powerless than
              ever.
          
          

          Parten (1984,
            pp. 11–12), considering whether men could be held as culpable as women in acts of
            adultery, says that a man was adulterous only if he had sex with another man’s wife.
            Puritan writers were sympathetic to equal standards, focusing chiefly on 1 Cor. 7:4: The power that Paul grants the wife
              over the body of her husband, his emphasis on the teaching that man and wife are one
              flesh and his stern condemnation of the body-polluting sin of harlotry, are taken
              together to provide the Biblical foundations for Elizabethan and Jacobean arguments
              against considering a husband’s adultery a less serious sin than a wife’s.

          
            Shakespeare puts the argument derived from Pauline teaching to use the
              first time he presents the image of a wife protesting her husband’s infidelities.
              Adriana . . . complains to the man she supposes to be her husband that his sexual
              crimes have in turn contaminated her: [quotes 535–9]. Here, arguably, Adriana is on firm doctrinal
              ground. But her reproachful tirade also contains a detailed portrait of the way in
              which a husband might be expected to react to the news of his wife’s adultery: [quotes
                525–32]. Her
              implication, clearly, is that the wife of an adulterer is entitled to experience some
              measure of the typical wronged husband’s outrage. As indirect and as limited in scope
              as is this endorsement of sexual parity, it is nonetheless part of the play’s larger
              portrait of Adriana as a woman on the verge of falling into the heresy of rejecting
              the divine law of sexual subordination. Her sister Luciana, a contrasting proponent of
              sweet reason and orthodox belief, must listen to Adriana querulously ask why men’s
              liberty should be more than women’s, and [listen as] . . . her good counsel is
              rejected contemptuously: [quotes 288]. The
              last point Adriana [12] raises, in her efforts to seduce
              Luciana into admitting that there are limits to the amount of wifely submission that a
              woman should be willing to exhibit, is the crucial question of whether she would
              endure her husband’s adultery: [quotes 304]. Luciana . . . gives the response that is the ultimate guarantee of her
              freedom from her sister’s taint: [quotes 305].
          

          That is, Adriana’s insistence on sexual equality is tainted.
            The wife who protests her husband’s adultery and who pairs that protest with an
              indirect or direct argument that she be considered her husband’s equal positions
              herself very near the social margin that divides the permitted from the
              prohibited. . . . The wife who takes this approach [of equality] may be seen as
              deluded, even dangerous—but the test she fails to pass is conceded to be the ultimate
              trial of her feminine submissiveness. In Shakespeare’s drama, which is shaped by [this
              view], the wife who . . . resists the temptation to question the double standard or
              to criticize her husband, has given the extreme proof of her worth as a
            wife.

          For Hennings
            (1986, pp. 96 ff.) on the debate between Adriana and Luciana in 2.1 in terms of An Homilie of the state of Matrimonie, see .

          Ranald (1987,
            pp. 112 ff.), after reviewing the literature and statutes that subject wives to husbands
            in terms of property ownership, sexual fidelity, and so on, says, It is
              hard to believe that English women, particularly married women, were considered to
              possess a freedom of conduct unique in Western Europe. Shakespeare . . . obviously
              understood the problems encountered by women as a result of their required
              subordination in marriage and in The Comedy of Errors he
              bases the subplot on some of them. At the same time he establishes his own pattern for
              marriage comedies. A matrimonial relationship is challenged by an independent woman
              (perhaps a shrew); problems ensue, with adultery sometimes alleged; and finally a
              resolution is reached. The woman usually accommodates her outward conduct to that of
              the man, but in also asserting her love, she shows such freedom of spirit that roles
              and attitudes are redefined in a marriage that is evolving towards mutuality and
              companionship. The husband is no longer foolish or tyrannous, the wife no longer
              shrewish, and the laws of fidelity and chastity are upheld.

          That Shakespeare intended the subplot . . . to be more than mere
              contrast . . . is obvious from his setting the play in Ephesus, with Eph.’s
            exhortation to wifely obedience. This biblical resonance is increased by the
              deliberate patterning of the debate between Adriana and Luciana after the
                Conjugium, one of the colloquies of Erasmus which Shakespeare may
              well have studied in school. In Erasmus, Xantippe is the archetypal shrew and Eulalia,
              the wife who speaks well of matrimony. She [113] preaches that
              the wife should be the looking glass of her husband . . . showing forbearance, even
              if the husband takes a mistress. She rehearses the debate and other plot
            elements.

          [116] The discovery that the reprehending Abbess is
              Adriana’s mother-in-law is more than a stock joke; it is also an ironic and amusing
              reference to the Erasmian colloquy. There Xantippe is brought to accept her wifely
              duties and practice patience only when Eulalia forces her to the realization that both
              her step-mother and her mother-in-law would be most gratified to see the couple
              separate. Thus in Erasmus, the redefinition of the wife’s role comes from an external
              influence, whereas in The Comedy of Errors it represents an
              internal development. Even in this early comedy Shakespeare is treating the shrew with
              some humanity. . . . Both Adriana and Luciana have developed in the course of the
              play—something unusual in a farce—and both have learned something of the realpolitik of marriage. . . . At the
              conclusion of the play Adriana has certainly not gained the mastery, though she does
              now have something with which to upbraid her husband, while he does not. What is
              important is that her shrewishness has been revealed as a reaction to the frustration
              of those deprived of legitimate liberty. . . . Adriana has shown her mettle and now
              accepts her wifely duties with love.

          Singh (1988, p.
            47), quoting 1516–21:
              The moral seems to be clear: if the husband errs, the wife should accept
              it. . . . The important point . . . is that most Elizabethans would have agreed with
              the Abbess and recognised that wives should not too much mind the sexual lapses on the
              part of their husbands though they themselves should lead totally chaste and
              unblemished lives. He scorns the double standard.

          Wolfensperger (1994, p. 29): On the surface of the debate it seems
            that Luciana does no more than speak one orthodoxy, that of female submissiveness in
            marriage, and Adriana argues for another, one that opposes the double standard of
            morality and the analogy between husband-wife and master-servant. But he studies
              the comedy’s external system of communication that guides our response.
              What we are faced with . . . is a whole system of interdependent delicate
              balances, or labile equilibriums, on virtually every level of the scene. The débat resembles a verbal duel, in which both
              sides can score points, but which ultimately ends in a draw. With this scene we are
              given an instance of something like a spot of indeterminacy. By its
              very nature it creates a kind of vacuum, which draws the recipient into the
              play.

          Other critics discuss the Ephesians’ marriage in more general ways.
              Brown (1957,
            pp. 54–6): Following the clues of the sonnets and Romeo
                and Juliet, the ideal of love’s wealth may be seen to inform the very
              earliest comedies. The Comedy of Errors is, in the main, an
              intrigue comedy which aims at making a certain number of characters look ridiculous;
              it deals, therefore, not with the joy of giving in love, but with the follies and
              evils of possessiveness. Adriana’s idea of love is to try to maintain a hold over her
              husband; the liberty of his actions galls her and she demands her rights. As part of
              this plan, she obtains the promise of a gold chain. Instead of the willing
                loan of free agents, Adriana sees love as a system of
              promises, duties and bonds. Even at her most submissive, when she cajoles her
              husband’s twin . . . to come home as her husband, she harps upon rights and
              possessions: [quotes 567–72]. . . . 

          [55] This kind of love is further defined by
              contrasted loves, that of Antipholus of Syracuse who offers himself to Luciana
              unasked, and for whom giving is its own reward: [quotes 834–8] or that of Luce who deals only
              in claims and possessions: [quotes 872–9]. This is the level of merely possessive love; and
              the fact is driven home by bringing these three loves together in one brief
              scene.

          
            There are further contrasts in the juxtaposition of misunderstandings
              about love and misunderstandings about the possession of servants, a gold chain, and a
              bag of ducats. For the like of Adriana there is little difference between them; so
              when the Goldsmith asks for his money on the strength of a bond, Antipholus of Ephesus
              in his refusal likens the confusion to Adriana’s sort of marriage: [quotes 1034–7]. [56] But there is one difference between the two kinds of
              misunderstandings: those between masters and men, and merchant and purchaser are
              occasioned solely by confused identities . . . but Adriana’s misunderstandings, her
              claims of rights and wrongs, ante-date any mistaken identity. The merchants treat
              their possessions naturally as best they may, Adriana treats hers unnaturally—her
              merchandise requires the use of love’s wealth in which giving is more important than
              taking or keeping.
          

          Brooks (1960,
            pp. 353, 355): But though in marriage the dominant woman threatens the
              proper ordering of a household, in courtship the woman enjoys a superior position.
              Courtship is not, then, very good training for marriage. Women who take seriously such
              lavish expressions of praise and worship as sonnet lovers heap upon them will not take
              easily to the altered marital situation. Such praise the lover in The
                Comedy of Errors heaps upon Luciana; he calls her our earth’s
                wonder,
              more than earth divine,
              a god,
              sweet mermaid, and siren ([819–34]). Adriana was also courted in
              just such a way: [quotes 508–13]. . . . 

          
            The transition from courtship to marriage has to be made, though. A
              woman matures by transforming herself from worshiped mistress to devoted wife, and a
              man matures by changing from a worshiper to a governor. Adriana offends in her
              shrewishness even though we sympathize with her in her provocation. But her
              shrewishness is more talked about than displayed. . . . 
          

          [355] Successful marriage depends . . . on the
              man’s transformation from lover to husband. . . . In spite of the discord, Adriana
              and her husband are attached to each other; since they are attached in spite of their
              discord, they have discovered a more satisfactory basis for attachment than the
              ethereal worship which Luciana’s lover expresses.

          Lloyd Evans
            (1969, p. 95): What The Comedy of Errors implies is that
              love must be tested, that what is and what seems are part of that testing, and that order, represented by true love
              within the formalisation of marriage, is the ideal and successful outcome of an honest
              and faithful submission to the testing: [quotes 289–99].

          
          Henze (1971,
            pp. 35–7, 39): Shakespeare’s chain . . . naturally symbolizes the
              cohesion of society as it asserts its orderly supremacy over prostitutes, wayward
              husbands, shrewish wives, and lost brothers. . . . I shall explore the process
              whereby this simple object becomes a complex symbol of the recommended norm in the
              play, the bridling of headstrong freedom and wandering
            individuality. . . . 

          [36] The freeing-binding theme is continued by
              Antipholus E., who wants to be master of more freedom than social peace permits [in
              desiring to dine with the Courtesan]. . . . Instead of freedom from all bonds,
              however, he gets freedom from no bonds at all and is finally symbolically tied in the
              bonds of marriage and society even as he is actually bound by ropes.

          Adriana, too, would like unbridled liberty: [quotes 284]. But Luciana tells her that social peace
            requires subordination.

          (P. 37): The finding of oneself is itself a losing . . . and this
              paradoxical relationship exists between the two parts of each major
              theme. . . . Antipholus [S.’s] . . . completeness, like Adriana’s and Antipholus
              E.’s, requires the social submersion. Aegeon and Antipholus E. are both freed from the
              bonds of ropes only to enter the bonds of marriage and social limitation, bonds more
              restrictive than the bonds just lost. With freedom comes binding, but with the
              binding, paradoxically, comes freedom—freedom of trust, of fellowship, of
              love. . . . 

          [39] The gold that bides often touching here
                [386–9] is the
              social bond of marriage. By preventing this touching—being late to dinner, neglecting
              his wife—Antipholus E. is neglecting the gold for the sake of the jewel, self-centered
              freedom. The chain is already an emblem of the marriage bond, and as the chain gets
              misplaced, so the bond weakens. But as the chain, a symbol of other social bonds as
              well, fulfills its function even as it wanders, so the bonds, even as they apparently
              weaken, continue to do their job. The bonds are unbreakable because they make one of
              two, as Adriana says in Act II (although she has the wrong Antipholus at
              hand) . . . : [quotes 514–24].
          

          Muir (1972, p.
            47): Shakespeare has no difficulty in extracting two interrelated lessons from
              his material—the damage done to marriage by infidelity and jealousy. He refers
            to 275–315, 362–91, 505–41, 787–814, 1559.

          Leggatt (1974,
            pp. 12, 17–18), quoting 815–23, 370–5: In the speeches of the lover, the idea of surrender is
              still innocent and uncomplicated, unbruised by reality. In the speeches of the wife,
              it has become tinged with self-pity and resentment, and we move from the idealism of
              courtship to the tensions of the sex war. . . . 

          [17] The emphasis at the end is not on the
              creation of a new social unit (as in Northrop Frye’s theory of comedy)
              but on the renewal of an old family unit. Shakespeare is silent about the marriage of
              Adriana and Antipholus of Ephesus; and Antipholus of Syracuse’s (presumably)
              approaching marriage is politely but firmly put to one side, as something to be
              discussed later. He says to Luciana: [quotes 1862–4]. He is still caught up in the wonder of the
              family reunion. . . . After the challenges to identity throughout the play the
              characters—and perhaps the audience—need this kind of comfort, a return to the old and
              familiar, rather than the start of something new which marriage symbolizes. Even at
              the end, the characters’ [18] disparate lives and experiences
              are not brought into a total harmony. . . . Marriage is not brutally dismissed, as in
              Plautus; but it is quietly placed in the background, and no great hopes are pinned on
              it.

          Schlösser
            (1977, pp. 29 ff.) presents a Marxist reading that speaks of Err. as the beginning of Sh.’s critique of a commercially competitive society
            that defeats proper human relations. See  for an elaboration.

          Wayne (1985)
            offers a history of the dramatic presentation of the shrew in England. Shrews might be
            made somewhat sympathetic. (P. 170): Marital discord is perhaps too easily
              resolved by unfeeling fools ([379]) like Luciana. Shakespeare never fully resolves it here, although he
              affirms the importance of marital and kinship ties through the general joy of the
              concluding family reunion.

          For Kehler’s
            (1991) discussion of Æmilia’s function as teaching Adriana to accept her married role
            without complaining, see .

          Thompson (1997,
            pp. 90–1) regrets that the early comedies have been ignored by feminist critics: I do not propose to attempt to appropriate The Comedy of
                Errors and Love’s Labor’s Lost for
              feminism. . . . Rather, my emphasis is on how these texts raise issues that are of
              real interest to feminist critics. . . . 

          [91] If as feminists we are looking for strong
              female characters . . . both plays show the women as distinctly superior to the men
              in terms of their behavior in the courtship plots. She cites Luciana’s rebuff
            of S. Antipholus in 3.2, Æmelia’s criticism of her daughter-in-law’s jealousy, which may
            have driven her husband mad, and (p. 97) Shakespeare’s longest and most explicit
              discussion of the double standard.

          Others who comment on marriage are Hankins (1978, p. 144): E. Antipholus and Adriana unite the
            sanguine and choleric temperaments, hence they will live in alternate periods of
              anger and happiness, and Candido (1990), who discusses the marriage in terms of the
            delayed meal,  below.

          That meal takes on thematic life. Tillyard (1965, pp. 54–5): We find
              Shakespeare following what was to prove his permanent instinct: never to forsake the
              norm of social life. However distant he may get from that norm into inhuman horror, or
              wild romance, or lyrical fantasy, or mystical heights, he always reverts, if only for
              a short spell, to the ordinary world of men and to its problems of how they are to
              live together. . . . It is an instinct that has made Shakespeare so widely loved and
              the lack of which explains the comparative neglect of Spenser. The extent to which he
              indulged that instinct in the Comedy of Errors has not been
              fully recognized.

          
            Take the setting. . . . Ephesus itself is a small ordinary town where
              everyone knows everyone else’s business, where merchants pre­[55]dominate, and where dinner is a serious matter. . . . Antipholus has
              indeed been laying up trouble for himself, for not only is he shockingly late for
              dinner but he is bringing with him two guests, probably unnotified and certainly
              offensive to the housewife as eating a dinner that through over-cooking does an
              injustice to her domestic competence.
          

          Wilders (1984,
            pp. 14–17): It is possible . . . to discover more precisely the kind of reaction
              this episode arouses in an audience. We are presented on the stage with the spectacle
              of a woman of some dignity and self-respect publicly denouncing a perfect stranger for
              his supposed sexual infidelity in the belief that the man is her husband, taking him
              off to dine with her almost by force, and then shouting abuse at her real husband in
              the belief that he is an intruder. This series of events . . . produces in us an
              agreeable affront to our sense of social propriety, our collective opinion of how
              husbands and wives ought to behave. It may be that we enjoy the breaking of
              conventions by fictional characters because we are reluctant to violate them ourselves
              and welcome the opportunity for others to do it on our behalf.

          Perhaps Sh. added characters to the source, and discarded others to create (p. 15)
              a small society and is thus able to depict a dislocation of social
              conduct on all its levels. . . . 

          [16] The Comedy of
                Errors is thus made up out of a series of farcical situations interspersed
              with passages of moral instruction and debate, and these two elements are connected by
              the fact that both are, though in very different ways, concerned with social
              behaviour. The audience is shown the comic spectacle of a small society thrown into
              confusion and is also offered general observations about how societies ought to
              function. Even apparently [17] trivial passages . . . turn out
              to be relevant to the play as a whole in that they are concerned with questions of
              social behaviour. The conversation between the resident Antipholus and his guest the
              merchant . . . is about the nature of hospitality, and his brother’s punning chatter
              with . . . Dromio is about the notion that there is a time for all
                things [458–9: there’s], a principle of decorum
              neglected by the constantly nagging wife.

          
          Candido (1990,
            pp. 225–7, 229–31), on the high importance of the midday meal, says: Clearly Antipholus of Ephesus’s failure to come to dinner on time is a repudiation of
              more than mere food; his absence from home is the first step in the flouting of an
              accepted social ceremony that helps define his identity as respected citizen and
              respectful husband. It is surely no coincidence that in the course of the play he is
              threatened with the loss of both of these socially and emotionally vital aspects of
              self. Reputation and marriage begin to dissolve together when the wrong brother dines
              at home.

          
            When viewed in this context Adriana’s behavior assumes a deeper and more
              richly suggestive character than the mere ragings of a jealous housewife. Her
              determination to refrain from eating despite the fact that her husband is two hours
              late ([277]) indicates a serious attempt
              to maintain personal equilibrium and social bonds in the face of heavy pressures.
              Adriana . . . is a fiercely combative woman confronting squarely the threat of an
              imperiled marriage and determined to sustain meaningful ties despite social and
              personal threats to her identity as wife and Lady. . . . [Luciana’s urging them to
              dine shows an] [226] indifference to her sister’s emotional
              plight that reveals the severe limitations of the unwedded woman’s easy aphorisms
              about marriage ([289–99]).
          

          Candido reports
            anthropological studies affirming the close connection between food and sexual longings
            and sexual identity. (P. 227): Adriana’s renewed enthusiasm for dinner with the
              man she thinks is her husband appears to include such psychological concerns. Despite
              the fact that Luciana will accompany the pair, theirs will be a rather private meal,
                above, symbolically located in the living quarters upstairs rather
              than in the more public business quarters below. . . . Clearly there is more at stake
              here for Adriana than the rearrangement of a disturbed afternoon. Her private family
              meal serves as a convenient social vehicle for the larger issue of forgiveness, and
              her insistence on privacy metaphorically links confidential family matters with the
              equally confidential regenerative power of the confessional: [quotes 603–4].

          E. Antipholus does not share his wife’s highly serious, highly symbolic view of this
            meal time, but still reacts badly when he is shut out.

          (P. 229): By virtue of his denied access to home and wife, the Ephesian brother
              comes to experience precisely the same feelings of alienation and sexual doubt that he
              has so casually inflicted upon his wife. . . . Antipholus’s isolation outside the
              locked house functions symbolically to define the spiritual divorce he has already
              produced while at the same time literalizing ominously the ends to which his neglect
              will lead, the anxieties of isolation and nonattachment.

          Candido says
            that the meal turns sour (p. 230): Perhaps less obvious . . . is the way in
              which the younger Antipholus’s behavior at Adriana’s dinner unwittingly parallels the
              unfaithfulness of his brother. As the symbolic embodiment of the younger version of
              his Ephesian twin, Antipholus of Syracuse reenacts his brother’s behavior by forsaking
              the woman who has welcomed him to the feast and turning his romantic attention to
              another. This slightly misrepresents the play, which has no dinner scene. In
            3.2 Luciana upbraids S. Antipholus for unfaithfulness, but she is apparently talking
            about another woman, perhaps the Courtesan, not herself. In 4.2 Adriana responds to
            Luciana’s report about S. Antipholus’s wooing her in 3.2, not to what happened at the
            table.

          (P. 231): Adriana’s broken banquet fails to produce its desired ends, but it
              nonetheless sets in motion a process of moral and social realignment that continues to
              the end of the play. Critics have generally tended to overlook the rejected wife’s
              response to her failed dinner, particularly her remarks upon hearing that at the meal
              her supposed husband has tried to woo Luciana. But again, the wooing takes
            place after the meal. He quotes 1125–8, 1131–4: The division here between heart and
              tongue . . . focuses upon yet another pair of forceful oppositions embedded in
              singleness. Adriana’s acknowledgement of her inner divisions . . . points implicitly
              to a means of finding concord in discord. Adriana is a frequent object of others’
              criticism . . . yet despite it all she remains the most fully responsive and
              synthetic character in the play, preferring finally in a crisis to labor at
              forgiveness rather than to ease into recrimination.
          

        





        
          Order and Disorder

          Problems within the family widen out into discussions of order and disorder. Snider (1876; 1887,
            pp. 61–3, 68–9, 72) writes on order and disorder in the family, in the state, and in
            commerce. He finds three movements in the action: The first movement . . . is
              the narrative of Ægeon, who is the father, and, therefore, the head of the
              Family. He recounts the separating events. Thus the Family seems
              utterly disrupted and destroyed, but just this unhappy condition of things is the [62] basis for a return to unity. But because of the
            twinness, the family has the capability of being acted on by chance.

          
            It will be seen that Accident . . . is made the deity of this lower
              world; in fact, it is given such a wide sway, that it becomes incredible, improbable.
              But it is the Poet’s plan to endow it with absolute rule for once, and see what it
              will do with itself. What will the Goddess Chance make out of the government of this
              universe? Here we can see; she annuls herself, she cannot exist alone; that is,
              external Accident, like internal Caprice, if given full rein, destroys its own end,
              undoes itself and brings forth the world of order. In other words, such a world is
              comic. . . . 
          

          It is . . . necessary to notice the institutional realm within which
              this chapter of accidents is playing. Both Family and State are hovering in the
              distance; Ægeon . . . , in [63] trying to bring together the
              scattered members of his domestic hearth, has fallen into the clutches of the law
              which is about to execute him. Thus even the State as well as the untamed elements of
              Nature seem to be hostile to the restoration of the family. But we, the
            audience, see order emerging. We . . . see that the whole is the comedy
              of Accident which is destroying itself by conflicting with the supreme order.
              Providence . . . is bringing the scattered members of the family together, but he
              puts on the mask of confusion, and makes horrible grimaces, whereat the puny
              individual gets frightened. . . . But we must look through the appearance, must peep
              under the providential mask, if we wish to behold the comedy. . . . 

          [68] The third principle [after family and
              state] which is involved in this entanglement is business—the commercial relations of
              the community. . . . The matter [of not paying for the chain] is at first treated as
              a jest, then it grows serious, and at last an officer is called in to enforce the
              demand. Here Authority is drawn into the meshes, and is victimized by an [69] appearance. . . . Public order is disturbed [and the
              resolution must begin]. But the difficulty cannot rest here; the abbess has defied the
              Family in the wife, and the Law in the officer; the conflict can only be settled by an
              appeal to the supreme authority of the land. But the Duke is likewise deluded,
            and all is clarified by the recognition of the twins.

          (P. 72): Mistaken Identity . . . shows how the individual is [sic; word
              missing] through society, and society through the individual. We see that, if one unit
              be displaced and another taken for it, the whole fabric will fall into
              disorder. . . . The individual must have society, in which he finds his true
              relations—he can exist as a reasonable being only in society; on the other hand,
              society requites the favor and recognizes him as this individual, and none other, in
              all his manifold relations, and thus gives him a true objective personality. Mistaken
              Identity steps between society and the individual, and, for a time, destroys their
              connection. Each side, having existence through the other, will, by such separation,
              rapidly pass into confusion and dissolution. But the difficulty rests upon Mistaken
              Identity, not upon Lost Identity; the trouble . . . is not permanent, but the mistake
              is discovered, and the old relations are all restored.

          Brown (1957)
            notices images of order and disorder in 265–8, 878,
              935, 727, 290–5,
            and 1550–1, remarking
            on the consequence to the last quotation (p. 129): Both [Luciana and the Abbess]
              recommend patience, and Adriana is shamed into vowing that Antipholus is
                lord of her and all she has ([1609]). The disorders arising from mistaken identities are resolved on visual
              proof of the mistakes, but Shakespeare seems to suggest that the disorders arising
              from intemperate hostility between man and wife must be resolved by the
              generous recognition of an order which permits them both to work
                contrariously in harmony and fulfilment.

          Hillman (1992,
            pp. 2–3, 75–6): Subversiveness [his topic] tends to construct the forces
              of order, whose affirmations are thus cast in the role
              of negations: containment becomes
              counter-subversion. . . . 

          [3] The result is a paradigm of subversion as
              not only challenging but intimately involved with the process of
              creation. . . . 

          [7] All deception is more or less
              subversive . . . and deception is the basic stuff of drama. . . . 

          
            To pursue human mistaking for a moment, the basis of this form of
              deception is the truism that appearances can be deceiving, and on the Shakespearean
              stage they frequently possess an unassisted subversive power akin to that of
              manipulative agents. Thus in The Comedy of Errors, as the
              title suggests, the errors themselves are implicitly given the power of
              creating the comedy and so virtually acquire the status of dramatist.
              Yet even in that self-consciously mechanical farce, it is impossible to ignore the
              complicity of self-deception.
          

          As an example of how subversiveness tends to construct the forces of
                order (p. 75): If there is any figure who
              embodies, rather than merely transmits, the omnipresent energy of transformation, it
              must be the Abbess Aemilia, who provides the answer to the Syracusan’s prayer:
                here we wander in illusions: / Some blessed power deliver us from
                hence![] ([1225–6]). According to the method of trickery, that prayer must first be
              mocked by the entrance of the Courtezan, whose talk of the chain makes her seem
              diabolic. . . . But when the prayer is finally answered, Aemilia’s language joins
              with the miraculous effect of her knowledge to identify her with time’s own discharge
              of its debt to the principle of creation: Thirty-three years have I but gone in
                travail / Of you, my sons, and till this present hour / My heavy burthen ne’er
                delivered [1890–2]. In cutting the Gordian knot woven by the plot’s crossing and
              recrossing, and reinforced imagistically with real chain and rope, she speaks with the
              voice of redemption, as she singles out [Egeon] whose confinement under sentence of
              death emblematizes the predicament of the others: [quotes 1825–6].

          
            In fact, it is the Abbess’s own application of the disruptive principle
              that brings her face to face with Egeon; for by refusing to release (the wrong)
              Antipholus to be bound by Adriana ([quotes 1507]), she provokes the wife to seek redress from the Duke. Precisely in not
              forseeing the consequences of her action, Aemilia behaves like subversiveness [76] itself. . . . By insisting on this separation [of
              1579–80]—again, on principle rather than on purpose—the Abbess recapitulates both the
              divisive means of the play at large and the holy end which those means
              mysteriously accomplish.
          

        





        
          Other Themes

          The emphasis on clock time in the play, and S. Dromio’s joking catechism on a
            personified Time in 2.2, leads to analysis of time as a theme. Brooks (1961, pp. 57, 68–9): The rendezvous with the merchant, at five o’clock [189] . . . helps establish the theme of
              timing, and the motifs of timely or untimely meetings or failures to
              meet. . . . 

          [68] The theme of time’s depredations . . . is
              the text of the mock disputation on Time and Hair. . . . The further comic fancy of
              debtor Time turning [69] back an hour when he meets with a
              Sergeant, links those [themes] of untimeliness and reversal of order.

          
          Salgādo (1972,
            pp. 82–83, 85, 91): The preoccupation with the movement of time . . . with its
              direction, its pace, and its consequences, does not affect merely the content of the
              play. Since drama in performance is an art which exists in time, a play where the
              involutions and deviations of time are part of the theme may be expected to show this
              in its very structure. (P. 83): He lists many references to clock time, of
            which Err. has more than any other Shn. play.

          
          
            The design of the play, pace Professor Baldwin, is not really based on a five-act structure on
              the Terentian model. Rather, its eleven scenes consist of an inner action contained
              within an outer one to which it is finally united. The structure of the action
              corresponds to two different aspects of time. The over-arching framework, in spite of
              its threatening implications, is essentially benevolent. Against a ground of moving
              accidents by flood and field, it illustrates the normal workings of the temporal
              process in comedy, speaking of the great commonplaces of wedlock, childbirth, and
              familial piety and pointing the arrow of our expectations towards the fullness of time
              when all disorders are healed and all divisions settled. . . . 
          

          Within this outer action . . . the main action takes place in a time
              gone crazy, twisted, looped, turning in on itself, not so much the medium of existence
              as a manifestation of its perplexities, even, at times, of its horror. He then
            reads the play for these features.
          

          He illustrates, pointing to alternations of language that indicate normal time with
            various kinds of dislocations, e.g., (p. 85): Dromio’s feeble pun [208–11], one of several
              quibbles on time which we shall encounter, goes to the heart of the matter. Clock-time
              and inward time have already begun to diverge and E. Dromio tells his supposed master
              as much: Methinks your ma[w], like mine, should be your clock [231,
              with n. on Pope’s emendation for cooke]. The doggerel lines
              following the four I have quoted above, each leaning on the other, pile up with
              something of the hectic rhythm of a clock that will not stop striking.

          He concludes (p. 91), Our superior awareness prevents us from identifying with
              any of the characters involved, except indirectly. The play remains a farce where
              Shakespeare takes us backstage, as it were, to show us what tricks can be worked with
              time without, for the most part, playing such tricks on us as he does
              in The Winter’s Tale and The
              Tempest. For the moment, we are protected from the puzzlements of time
              dismembered.
          

          Zimmermann
            (1975, pp. 215–18) shows how the personification of Time (463–75) makes concrete the theme of
            untimeliness and its consequences mentioned by Brooks, above; he emphasizes the emblematic aspect of
            bald Father Time with a forelock to be grasped or the occasion missed.

          Critics’ emphasis on commerce in Ephesus takes on thematic dimensions beginning in the
            mid-20th c. as academics start to take the play seriously. Staging of the play began to
            make this commerce visual at least as early as the 1860s; see . Knight (1932, pp. 115–16): Now, in this play a family is first
              dispersed by tempest. Next, the action shows a remarkable series of mistakes in a
              magic land of merchants and riches, with a final consummation in union and happiness.
              The play is full of riches imagery especially. He lists lines 626 (oddly late for that sum of a thousand
            marks, which first appears at 25), 1429, 1384, 1222, 1252, 1616, and
            more. (P. 116): The play is full of gold and other riches, of merchants, and
              sea-voyages.

          Pettet (1949, p. 68) comments on the Courtesan, who, though
              less obtrusive than in Menaechmi, comes direct from a
              stereotyped mould of Latin comedy, with her sharp, uncompromising, mercenary sense,
              and her unabashed self-confidence as an accepted part of society.

          Leggatt (1974,
            pp. 7–8): Throughout the play there are several small touches conveying
              the Ephesians’ narrow concern with money. The merchant who talks with Antipholus of
              Syracuse . . . is kind enough to warn him against the law; but he refuses an
              invitation to keep him company and join him for dinner, on the grounds that he is
              already engaged to certain merchants, / Of whom I hope to make much
                benefit ([187–8]). The officer who arrests Antipholus of Ephesus refuses to release
              him, even when told he is mad and needs treatment: [8] [quotes
                1406–10].

          
            In this commercial world, Antipholus of Ephesus appears to have
              occupied, when the action begins, a solid and respectable place. . . . His marriage,
              whatever its internal difficulties, is eminently respectable, having been arranged by
              the Duke himself ([1608–9, 1674]). In the commercial
              and domestic spheres he inhabits, disruption may be fun for the audience, but it is
              unsettling and unpleasant for the victim. . . . But the world of commerce simply goes
              crazy when an irrational factor is introduced, and the only satisfaction is for chains
              and ducats to be restored to their original owners, as though the confusion had never
              taken place. Nothing is gained in the process, for the transactions of business are
              barren and limited, incapable of the sudden, spontaneous enrichment that we see in the
              transactions of love. . . . The only party to gain something is the audience: since
              commercial life has been transacted in such unflattering terms, we are bound to take a
              special, mischievous delight in seeing it disrupted.
          

          
          Schlösser
            (1977, pp. 41–3): The Comedy of Errors . . . is the first
            variation of the theme of alienation of humans because of paid cash: one
            cannot get to Solinus by an appeal to sympathy, but only with a thousand marks. E.
            Antipholus is respected only as long as he has ready money. The relations of the
            merchant, goldsmith, Antipholus and [42] the courtesan function
            only on a financial basis; without it, all interaction [Gemütlichkeit] ceases. The exchange of purse, necklace, and
            diamond ring shows the objectification [Verdinglichung] of human relations. The play could be called The Merchants of Syracuse and Ephesus.

          [43] The play must be taken seriously as part of Sh.’s
            humanistic critique of competition in society [Konkurrenzgesellschaft] (Ger.).
          

          Berry (1988,
            pp. 20–2): The chain, the ring, five hundred ducats, a thousand marks,
              guilders, angels—gold pieces are the props of this play. And
              they define the play’s society. The Comedy of Errors is above
              all a play of the merchant class. . . . 

          The businessmen, Antipholus of Ephesus, Balthazar, Angelo (a
              goldsmith), the First and Second Merchant, set the tone of the town. Ephesus is an
              international trading center, and like Venice, it is founded on political stability,
              the free movement of capital, reliable and equitable laws that the local judiciary may
              not adjust at whim. He quotes 147–8, 187–8, and refers to E. Antipholus’s arrest for debt and
            to the Courtesan’s getting the diamond ring instead of the chain.

          (P. 21): The action of The Comedy of Errors
              could not take place other than in a town whose business is business.

          
            Nor could the comedy. The Ephesian merchants have to adjust to shock,
              dislocation of good business, repudiation of debt, and solid citizens behaving
              erratically. . . . 
          

          Normality violated by the bizarre is the formula for comedy here.
              Shakespeare has little interest in investigating the merchant class beyond [22] the limits of the dramatically feasible. He speaks of
            the domestic drama and the cruel relationship between master and servant, and concludes,
              On the evidence of The Comedy of Errors, the worst
              masters in the canon are merchants.

          Bruster (1992,
            p. 75): Social instability results when E. Antipholus gives the chain to the Courtesan.
              Replaced as husband, Antipholus spitefully uses the chain in an attempt to
              substitute another woman for his wife. . . . But Shakespeare goes beyond his model in
              using the chain to complicate an additional relationship, illustrating the powerful
              connections among personal and public, domestic and commercial.

          Hall’s (1995)
            is an economic-theory reading of Err., in which (p. 41)
              identity is equivalent to reputation, which is supported by the ability to pay
              cash at a specified time. . . . [42] The crisis is not a
              metaphysical affair but an economic and semiotic one, culminating in Antipholus of
              Ephesus’ apparent failure to honor his pledge ([982 ff.]). The crisis of identity is a failure of credit (etymologically derived from belief, but, from 1542,
              denoting the delivery of goods in the belief in a future ability to pay.)

          He says that credit allows mobility, and that the law guarantees credit, though when
            the trade war law is imposed, mobility ceases. Duke Solinus must enforce a mercantile
            law that he himself did not enact, making him share (p. 44) the patriarchal
              impotence of Egeon, with whom he sympathizes. At the same time, this decentering of
              power must be negated by the exercise of judicial violence. The statutes must be
              sealed in blood. His argument about the Duke’s impotent sympathy for Egeon is
            marred by his repeated statement that Egeon has twenty-four hours to find his
            ransom.

          Christensen
            (1996, p. 23) sees the play as dramatizing a stabilizing moment before the advent of
            capitalism separated the domestic from the commercial scene by gender and in space,
            i.e., home and market. While the play sets up . . . opposition between
              husbands and wives, the worlds of trade and home, it ultimately insists upon their
              ever-shifting interrelations. No definite hierarchy emerges; instead the demands of
              business and family alternately and farcically interfere with each other. So, as we
              might expect, the Antipholi and their male associates—merchants, the goldsmith, and
              city magistrates—appear in public scenes and talk in terms of economic exchange and
              legal sanctions, while women converse inside, their talk focusing on
                private topics such as marriage and family, as in Act two, scene
              one . . . and in the beginning of Act five, when the Abbess catechizes Adriana about
              wifely duty.

          
            However, these discourses are not discrete: the men’s business in the
              mart sustains the household economy, while the household, through both consumption and
              (re)production, fuels the mart.
          

          Kinney (in Mowat &amp; Werstine, ed. 1996, pp. 182–3, 186): The
              characters of The Comedy of Errors become not [183] subjects but objects: integers moved by events and by the
              playwright, like so many chess pieces on a comic chessboard. Rather than feel their
              concerns, sharing them, we laugh at them.

          
            In a very real sense . . . such depersonalized characters become comic
              commodities whose purpose, in a metatheatrical expansion of the market setting, is
              their commercial values as figures of fun. . . . As recent economic historians have
              demonstrated, the Elizabethan age, in which individualism was just beginning to be
              awakened, was an age deeply concerned with a new sense of the market and the
              marketability of goods, of talents, and even of people. . . . While Shakespeare sets
              the story in Ephesus, the play, performed in London, takes on the features of London
              itself—the city of trade, the port for sea voyages. . . . 
          

          [186] Materialism informs the premises of the
              play and commerce its actions. He goes through the play to illustrate this
            assertion.

          Hunter (1997,
            pp. 121–5): Yet Shakespeare is careful to ensure that Aegeon’s crossings
              of the Mediterranean have not been merely romantic but also as practical as even
              Messenio could wish. The presence of romantic individualism as well as self-interest
              in the procedures of the merchant-adventurer allows Shakespeare to show the world of
              errors, deceptions, and supposes to be one in which loss and gain can be construed in
              terms both of money and emotion. The life depicted in New Comedy provides a natural
              basis for this double take. The Menaechmi views social life
              as a petty competition for goods, for status, and for freedom to impose oneself on
              other people, so as to escape their imposition. Shakespeare by no means denies this
              image, but he is careful to represent the acquisitive life as more socialized and
              regulated than it seems to be in Plautus. . . . 

          
            In the opening exchange . . . the Duke of Ephesus establishes his
              position as primarily the guarantor of . . . laws that protect trade for
                merchants our well-dealing countrymen [11] (where well-dealing carries the sense of
              both good commercial practice and moral behaviour).
              Death is defined in these speeches as the necessary consequence of wanting
                guilders [12]—the coinage chosen
              suggests that Ephesus is conceived of as an antique Antwerp—and so by fair exchange
              this present Syracusan merchant must now pay a thousand marks or die.
          

          
            But the opening scene is by no means a one-way commercial [122] street. . . . The impulses to romantic identity and to
              hard-headed exploitation are required to interrogate one another, both speakers
              espousing self-deceiving and incompatible values. The Duke speaks half for
              mercantilism, half for feudal authority, the merchant half for family solidarity and
              half for entrepreneurial action. Neither seems to notice his divided
              duty. . . . 
          

          
            Even in the following scene, when the content signals that we have moved
              from Pericles to Plautus, the same paradoxical union of
              nature and commerce continues to appear. The merchant we meet here . . . has taken
              good commercial steps to avoid a fate like that we have just witnessed in his father’s
              case: he has banked his money with another (Ephesian) merchant and has a false
              identity prepared in case trouble arises. Sociability is not the source of the compact
              with his Ephesian contact. Business comes first; the Ephesian must leave in order to
              take up an invitation to certain merchants | Of whom I hope to make much
                benefit ([187–8]). He is soon away, with Sir, I commend you to your own
                content.
              Own content is, however, a phrase that triggers in Antipholus’ mind
              powerful memories of a different value [123] system in which
              content cannot belong to the individual but only to the family group: [quotes 197–204]. What the
              world of Ephesus seems to offer to both Aegeon and Antipholus (and what the art world
              of New Comedy offers to Shakespeare) is an orderly system of time (fixed inside an
              orderly social and commercial system)—time to be used to collect ransom for Aegeon,
              time to undertake the tasks Antipholus must perform in Ephesus; but this is time that
              these isolated individuals can apprehend only as meaningless vacancy, and that the
              society can define only as madness. . . . 
          

          
            What Shakespeare has done is to take the ordering system of New Comedy
              and place it in an estranging perspective, which shows its assumptions to be not the
                natural but only the learned routines of particular social groups.
              These are, of course, the groups that farce tends to fasten on—those who live too
              securely inside predetermined social systems, those we might call, briefly and
              anachronistically, the bourgeoisie. But, unlike nineteenth-century farce, The Comedy of Errors, though it redefines private
                content as madness, has a larger purpose than épater les bourgeois.
          

          [124] The end of the play is very different from
              that of the Menaechmi with its proposed sale of the
            household goods and wife. The Comedy of Errors
              ends . . . not with a business deal but with a miracle. The play comes back to the
              romance story of old Aegeon. The time of his reprieve is up, but time is no longer a
              merely sequential medium. The solemn procession to the place of execution has hardly
              entered before it is overwhelmed by farcical confusions as various petitioners demand
              contrary assurances about what has happened when. We are given unmistakable signals
              that anagnorisis is upon us; but before that true cadence can sound we must hear once
              again the contrary music of Aegeon’s frustrated longing and despair: [quotes 1788–99]. Shakespeare
              has reserved the play’s most powerful poetry for a special effect—to show us the
              tragic abyss of estrangement at the very moment of its comic release. For now romance
              finally absorbs error in a characteristic expression of the comic-miraculous. One by
              one the errors are unpicked and repositioned as truths. But they are not, we should
              notice, discounted: the dinner, the chain, the purse of ducats, the diamond, are
              presented as the factual markers by which any society (not just a bourgeois one) comes
              to know itself. Yet at the same time as these stubborn and irreducible facts are
              asserted, identity is celebrated in terms of a different set of values. At a new
              gossips’ feast the Duke will act as godfather [125] for the
              rechristening of the members of the family miraculously reconstituted. Their names,
              the signs of their belonging together, integrate them not only inside the family but
              also inside the state. A sub-plot coda replays in a final vaudeville exit the comfort
              of established relations: [quotes 1909–18]. The simultaneity of a jostling exit makes a
              good theatrical joke; it also raises, one last time, the basic question of the
              competitive ethic, and it offers once again the play’s response, which is not to deny
              it or preach against it, but to set it side by side with the incommensurate ethic of
              brotherhood and family solidarity, and to leave it there without further
              comment. In a footnote to theatrical joke,
            Hunter says,
              There may be, in addition, a reference to the Show of Amity in the Gesta Grayorum . . . where the representatives of Gray’s Inn and
              the Inner Temple enter arm in arm to show that their quarrel over precedence has come
              to an end. It is probable that The Comedy of Errors was
              performed as part of the Gesta Grayorum.

          One recurrent, European line of analysis tries to find a single, overarching
            significance in the play, coming to amusingly opposed conclusions that reflect the
            temperament of the times. Ulrici (1839, tr. 1846, pp. 261–2): [Err.] must be pronounced a most amusing satire on man’s boasted wisdom and
              discernment. The remarkable resemblance of two couples is sufficient to set a whole
              city in uproar and confusion. Life accordingly appears here as a continued but varying
              succession of delusion and mistake . . . [262] not cleared up
              until the two pairs of twins are accidentally brought face to face. By all this the
              truth (not more comic than tragic) is most strikingly impressed upon us, that the
              knowledge and ignorance of man run so nicely into each other, that the boundary line
              almost disappears, and that the very convictions which we look upon as the most
              certain and best grounded may, perhaps, turn out to be nothing but error or
              deception.
            Hülsmann (1856,
            p. 148): Man, from noble instinct and inner love, driven by worthy motives, ceaselessly
            seeks to find what he is looking for, even despite many hard tests; persistence is the
            pure source of action, the noble tendency in humans (Ger.).

          Sievers (1866):
              Err. presents a positive critique of the power of the human
            spirit to overcome human impotence in the face of irresistible Nature and defective
            perceptions. Glunz (1938): Mankind is governed by fate and luck, no matter what its
            wishes and desires may be; the comedy lies in that little man appears miserable and
            laughably helpless in the hand of an incomprehensible power (Ger.). Lüthi (1957, p. 185): Nature and
            Fortune actually intend better for humans than the characters think, collaborating with
            resolute searching and patient waiting (Ger.). Paris (1960) discusses the occult, especially the
            movement from fallen state to redemption; all the ruptures lead to a reunited state and
            restored harmony; the story, secretly mathematical, tells of the divisions that prohibit
            the desired reunion into the one. Schabert (1972, p. 397): The theme is loss of identity which
            deepens the farce into a true existential study of appearances and reality, and the
            problem of estrangement of humans from themselves and from their fellows. Naumann (1978, pp.
            53–4): Appearance and error rule in this nonsensical world; the resolution does not
            settle anything, for it is only a fairy-tale ending, not a rational settling of the
            errors. Seehase
            (1981): Err. presents a Marxist dialectic of comic and tragic,
            social reality and private conflict, plebeian and high classes.

          For Garber’s
            (1980, pp. 121 ff.) anthropological reading, see .

          Trousdale
            (1980, pp. 246 ff.) offers a semiotic reading of comedy, touching lightly on Err.: My argument will be that generic structure [of
              comedy] is a semiological structure and that the system of relationships to which we
              respond is different in degree but not in kind from the system of relationships that
              Saussure observed in ordinary language.

          In Saussure’s view, meaning is linked to a perception of difference, [247] and elements of a system
              are defined by their relation to other elements of that system. We distinguish the
              word tell from the word fell by
              distinguishing the difference between a t and an f. In the same way comedy, the name that we give to a particular
              structure of events on a stage, is discernible as structure only in relation to
              tragedy. Hero could die, but does not; that she does not might be a way of
            classifying Ado as a comedy, except that we know from the
            beginning that she will not die. Such patterns are language patterns rather than
              mimetic actions and we respond to those patterns in the same way in which we respond
              to language. That is to say, we read both the actor and the action as
              we watch them on stage. . . . We place each character and each action according to a
              recognized grammar which is based on predictability; When
            beginning a clause will be followed by a noun or a pronoun.

          
            Predictability . . . seems . . . an essential characteristic both of
              grammatical structure and of genre. Structure in this sense is structure of plot and
              predictability is a predictability of function. At the level of function we always
              know the plot and it is that knowledge that makes it possible for us to watch the
              play. It is within the context of this knowledge of a known convention that we make
              distinctions and that we read. Thus we distinguish The
                Comedy of Errors from Twelfth Night not only by
              noting the different ways in which the protasis (exposition) is handled in both plays,
              but also by observing how in the one, mistaken identity in its simplest sense provides
              the ground of the entire plot, whereas in the other there are many kinds of mistaken
              identity. Nonetheless, we recognize Malvolio as belonging to the same group of
              characters as Antipholus of Ephesus, and I would argue that the beginning of Twelfth Night is like the beginning of The Comedy
                of Errors in much the same way in which John hit the
                ball is like Mary bit the cat. We are not surprised in
              either play that mistakes in identity result in confusions in love.
          

          She turns to Clubb’s theatergrams (see ), (p.
            251) a collection of movable and combinable parts which . . . range
              from units of action or character to thematic patterns or metaphoric uses of intrigue
              structure. . . . 

          Such structures as signs are capable of transformations, as is the English
              sentence, and can generate other verbal shapes. The association of madness
            with disguise is such a unit, or topos. The uses of this topos in The Comedy of Errors and in Twelfth Night
              show us something about how Shakespeare employed theatergrams. . . . 

          [252] After he has met Adriana, Antipholus of
              Syracuse remarks [quotes 577–9]. Having been attacked by Sir Andrew and received by Olivia, Sebastian
              remarks: What relish is in this? How runs the stream? Or I am
                mad, or else this is a dream. Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep; If
                it be thus to dream, still let me sleep! (4.1.61–64
                  [1977–80]) Were we to explicate Antipholus’ response, we would have
              to say that sleep and dream as used here blur the sharp outline of reality, at least
              from Antipholus’ point of view, and we might, if we liked, attach his observations to
              his earlier ones in which he sees himself as a drop of water and feels himself to be
              lost. Sebastian . . . uses dream in such a way that it acts as a compliment to Olivia
              and this compliment is heightened in the last two lines of the speech to suggest the
              true pleasure he takes in Olivia’s company. The bewilderment as such has deepened into
              an expression of love.

          She compares 608–10
            with TN 4.3.9–21 [2123–35]. (P.
            253): Sebastian’s exploration of the commonplace is in essence an examination of
              the commonplace to see how and in what ways it might be applied. As a result, his
              character is more deeply etched than that of Antipholus, and Twelfth
                Night, filled with such craft, more profound in its considerations and more
              original than The Comedy of Errors. . . . What makes both
              plays comedies is . . . the ordering of the theatergrams out of which they are
              made.

          Elam’s (1984) is a specialized study emphasizing speech-acts
            (perlocutions, illocutions, and the like), as well as figures distributed throughout the
            comedies. For example, he writes about chiasmus (pp. 256–7): The actantial mix-up
              is . . . the expression of the perfect double mirroring between the two sets of
              twins. . . . [Quotes 425–6, 444–9, and 568–9.] [257] These dramatic-figural transactions in
                [Err.] necessarily have a visual counterpart in the facial
              and costumic puns created amongst the actors, and in the confusing succession of their
              entrances and exits.

          Beiner (1993,
            pp. 94–8) canvasses all the kinds of violence in the play—the reported shipwreck, the
            law condemning Egeon, verbal violence and physical beatings, Adriana’s anxiety about her
            marriage, and so on—whose comic resolution will bring clarification (p. 97): The
              action of errors is not merely an exhaustive series of possible permutations of
              misidentification . . . : it is an exploration of anxieties, of which violence is a
              symptom, and a comic healing process which uses the exacerbation generated through
              error as a kind of catharsis.

          Salkeld (1993,
            p. 71), on how madness is represented rather than what it is: The misprision and
              imputed madness of [E.] Antipholus is itself a reading of the unfixed social relations
              of the Ephesian world. The representation of the inner disorder of the
              character is entirely constructed by the wider confusions of the play. Indeed, the
              madness consists in nothing more than the contradictions and failures dramatised in
              the play at the level of the social body.

        





        
          
            Drame à Clef
          

          Gervinus (1863,
            1:190–2): It is not impossible, that upon the point of the discord in
              this family from jealousy and the quarrelsome nature of women, not only an æsthetic
              but in consequence of personal sympathy, a pathological stress was laid by the
              poet. . . . 

          [191] It were certainly possible, that these
              early productions [showing shrews like Adriana] grew out of these passages in the
              poet’s personal experience, [192] that they . . . rested on
              the inner experience of his own life.

          Sarrazin (1897,
            p. 115) supposes that Adriana’s shrewishness reflects Sh.’s own domestic experience.

          Harris (1909)
            collects most of Adriana’s speeches describing her unhappiness to affirm that Sh. is
            portraying his unhappy marriage. Idem (1912) repeats and elaborates the biographical
            assertions about Anne Shakespeare’s shrewishness presented in Adriana.

          The Comedy of Errors has drawn a single bit of
            anti-Stratfordian comment. Clark (1931, pp. 19–21) thinks that The Historie of
              Error, played at court on 1 Jan. 1577 and thought by some to be an early
            version of Err. that Sh. rewote (it is not extant; see ), was
              the first of [Edward de Vere, the Earl of] Oxford’s plays to be played at
              Court, that a boyish effort could not be expected to have the finish of a mature
              writer, and that twenty years later, Oxford took up this boyish effort and rewrote
              parts of it.

          She (p. 20) likens 197–202 to a stanza written by de Vere sometime around 1576: Were I a king I might command content; Were I obscure unknown would
              be my cares, And were I dead no thoughts should me torment, Nor words, nor
              wrongs, nor love, nor hate, nor fears; A doubtful choice of these things which to
              crave, A kingdom or a cottage or a grave.

          She proposes that 281–3, 287–8
            hint at de Vere’s resentment at being restrained (she does not say from what) by his
            father-in-law, Lord Burghley, and 747–67 as pertinent to de Vere’s life in 1576, when he was
            in (p. 21) some kind of trouble with his wife.

          For Feldman’s
            (1955) psychoanalytic study that says Sh. was dramatizing his marriage and oedipal
            problems, see  above.

          Three critics argue that Sh. engaged in the religious politics of his time.

          Axton (1977,
            pp. 3, 80–5) says that the law court revels and the plays staged there in the late 1580s
            and early 1590s were a forum for speculation about how the royal succession was to be
            worked out. She distinguishes what appeared on the public stage and on the Inns’ stage:
              Although Elizabethan drama was often political and sometimes
              vigorously polemical in its function, theatrical conventions developed during this
              century were a protection to playwrights and performers. To my knowledge the Queen
              punished no Inns of Court dramatist or actor for displeasing her or her government
              with a play. . . . 

          [80] The revels [Gesta
                Grayorum] of 1594/5 and Shakespeare’s Comedy of
                Errors manifest their authors’ awareness of the specific political
              implications of such general moral and religious language. . . . 

          [81] The tacit notion in 1594/5 is that the
              theatre will instruct for the future; the lawyer’s prince and his knights might begin
              to model their behaviour on courtiers and player kings of the public
              stage. . . . 

          [82] The new setting Shakespeare chose for
              Plautus’s comedy of twin brothers had current religious and political connotations.
              Homely misunderstandings caused by the Ephesian and alien twins . . . by their very
              absurdity minimize the gravity of legal conflict between two warring states and
              prepare for a comic resolution.

          
            A rift in the old Amity between the states
              of Purpoole and Templaria was the revels theme in 1594/5. The outraged departure of
              the Templarian Ambassador on Innocents’ night, the second evening of the revels,
              initiated a deft parody of language and manoeuvers then employed between the English
              and the Scottish courts. Following this breach of amity a Comedy of
                Errors . . . was played by the Players. . . . The following day a revels
              trial inquired whether the rift between the two states was caused by an
              enchanter (a creator of theatrical illusions) or by misinterpretation of the
              law. . . . After trial the innocent enchanter was freed and the old law of misrule,
              impersonated by the revels Attorney and Solicitor, was stocked and sent to the
                Tower.
          

          She lists the distinguished guests at the revels as they continued on 3 Jan., among
            them courtiers who had to suffer James’s outrage at not being fully invested with
            regalia when he was created Knight of the Garter by Elizabeth. Closer amity with
              Scotland was a question which arose in their daily government work.

          The play begins with the potential tragedy, Solinus’s decree. (P. 83): But even as he pronounces the death sentence the ruler expresses a conflict within
              himself which the rest of the play will humorously and irreverently [84] explore. Who sees truer in judging an alien, the law or the prince’s
              compassion? There is a conflict, as we see from the shifting pronouns, between the
              ruler’s two bodies. [Quotes 145–52, italicizing pronouns.]

          
            His is a problem peculiar to a king twin born with
                greatness. . . . Legal differences between Ephesians and Syracusians seem
              more and more absurd as all the characters fail to distinguish between the enemy alien
              and his Ephesian twin. The quarrel between Ephesus and Syracuse which must cost Aegeon
              his life is preposterous.
          

          
            Duke Solinus’s baffled inability to distinguish between an alien and a
              denizen when the twins stand before him (in Act V) undermines legal precedence so
              seriously argued by sixteenth-century lawyers: [quotes 1817–19, 1909–18]. . . . 
          

          Solinus’s participation in this festivity is figurally appropriate to
              Innocents’ Day, celebrated in the Gray’s Inn Christmas kingdom. The Old Law [of
              Ephesians] is put aside; in enlightened Ephesus there will be no slaughter of
              Innocents. The performance in 1604 was (p. 85) performed at court for
              the royal alien himself. James, living proof that there is a time for all
                things [458–9], comfortably seated upon the throne of Elizabeth, was then
              deeply engaged in his cherished plan for the union of his two Protestant
              kingdoms.

          Hamilton (1992,
            pp. x, 61, 64, 78, 85) includes Err. with Jn., TN, MM, Cym., and H8 as plays that, if one can
            master the code, deal with church-state politics from the beginning to the very end of
            Sh.’s career, controversies involving presbyterians and puritans in Err. Her emphasis is on the polemical literature that the church-state
              controversies produced [because] it is in such writing that one most readily
              encounters the discourses (the rhetoric, the idioms) by means of which the
              controversies were enacted, and not only confronts more than one side of an issue, but
              also learns how each side in a particular controversy appropriated the idioms and
              arguments of the other side.

          Her first, and repeated, example misstates the locking out of E. Antipholus. (P. 61):
              Suspicious that her husband has been unfaithful, Adriana locks him out of the
              house, an exclusionary tactic that is homologous with the official Elizabethan
              rhetoric against nonconformity. But what happens is that Adriana thinks she
              has her husband, is reconciled with him, and orders S. Dromio
            to keep them from being disturbed (567–615). Hamilton’s argument is that Adriana, who stands both for the
            established church that is keeping nonconformists out and for Queen Elizabeth, whose
            policies the church is following, needs to be encouraged to admit the nonconformists.
            The code Sh. uses involves such matters as (p. 64) his choosing Ephesus because, in the
            polemics of the time, the presbyterians pointed out that it was not clear whether Paul
            left Timothy in Ephesus as bishop, or as minister and evangelist; our understanding that
            the beatings are allegorized as the Dromios (p. 78) literalise the language of
              violence that had become the staple of the puritan and anti-puritan tracts and
              treatises; our knowing that the golden chain represents a catena, a collection of explanations about
            theological matters, usually Roman Catholic but made newly popular in Richard Perkins’s
              A golden chain . . . (1591, Latin 1590); and the audience’s
            remembering (p. 85) that in the preface to the 1583 ed. of Actes and
              Monuments, Foxe used the metaphor of a shipwreck three times in encouraging
            his countrymen to work toward the goal of unity, reuniting the families of conformists
            and nonconformists into the English church.

          Some objections to this essay are: How can the code be performed? that is, how can any
            of the separate items—chain, shipwreck, exclusion—that combine in the code to urge the
            state to be inclusive in its dealings with the presbyterians, be made clear by
            theatrical means? Is it likely that Sh. assembled all the diffuse elements Hamilton identifies
            into his composition of Err.? Say it was what happened, and
            only a few members of the audience, perhaps all the Gray’s Inn audience, cracked the
            code, surely the town gossip would let the code be known, and some record of the scandal
            (instructing Queen Elizabeth) would have come down to us? And of course there lies the
            last objection—verifiability. Interpretive criticism that illuminates unsuspected
            meanings need not be verified, but when plays are said to be intended to change state
            policy, the critic has the responsibility to show that some one of the contemporary
            audience understood what was being proposed in coded terms.

          Miller (2001,
            pp. 199–201) believes that England’s recent experience with Spain influences Err. Philip II placed an embargo on English trade of a kind that
            echoes the trade war between Syracuse and Ephesus, including the threat and the reality
            of execution. S. Antipholus’s suspicion of Ephesus (263–7) is a reminder that (p. 200)
              Protestant Englishmen held the same views of Spain’s Catholicism, which they
              regarded partly as superstitious hocus-pocus, partly as a potential conduit for
              devilish influence. . . . The absurdity of Papistry is embodied in . . . Doctor
              Pinch. . . . The threat of Papist authority figures and their murky sources of power
              materializes when Shakespeare entrusts the management of the dénouement to an abbess.
              In the notionally non-Christian setting of the ancient Mediterranean, the Abbess
              cannot be associated specifically with Papistry, but she surely carries some of its
              marks. If so, her wisdom and benevolence reverse the anti-Papist expectations of an
              English audience. . . . Shakespeare first gives Catholicism a human face, then finds
              for the Abbess a different and more reassuring role as the long-lost wife of Egeon,
              and therefore neither a nun by vocation nor even a challengingly autonomous
              female.

          He relates S. Dromio’s description of his master’s arrest, with its diuill, hard heart, and the carrying of poor souls to hell (1142–3, 1149) to (p. 201) English folklore of the Spanish
              Inquisition, with its monstrous persecutions and infernal prisons.

          The beatings the Dromios suffer invoke the Spanish menace. . . . Had the
              Spanish invasion succeeded, Englishmen believed that they would have suffered the
              degradations of slavery, including whippings and brandings of children under
            seven.

          Other scholars look to Err. for clues to tell them what Sh.
            did in the so-called lost years (1585–92). Beginning with Malone, some argue that he served in a
            law office. Malone
            (ed. 1790, 1:307): His knowledge of legal terms is not merely such as might be
              acquired by the casual observation of even his all-comprehending mind; it has the
              appearance of technical skill; and he is so fond of displaying
              it on all occasions, that I suspect he was early initiated in at least the forms of
              law; and was employed, while he yet remained at Stratford, in the office of some
              country attorney, who was at the same time a petty conveyancer, and perhaps the
              Seneschal of some manor-house. He cites 1151–2.

          Cuningham (ed.
            1907, pp. xlii ff.): Not to speak of the extreme improbability of
              Shakespeare having any spare time to devote to the [xliii]
              technicalities of the law when in London and actively engaged as actor and dramatist,
              a careful and minute study of the whole works leads us irresistibly to the conclusion
              that Shakespeare’s mind must have been early steeped in the minutiæ of practical and
              technical legal work. . . . The apprentice to the law carried about with him through
              life a vivid remembrance of his early apprenticeship. . . . 

          
            The particular legal expressions or references in The
                Errors may now be roughly analysed as follows: — 
                (1) References to the law of property and conveyancing: — [315] This fool-begg’d patience in thee will be left. [424] And make a common of my serious hours. [466–9] There’s no time for a man
                  to recover his hair. May he not do it by fine and recovery? and recover the lost hair of
                  another man? [630] That
                  you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show.
                    [631] If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were
                  ink. [1575] It is a branch and parcel of mine oath.
              
              
                (2) References to legal procedure: — [145–8] Now, trust me, were it not
                    against our laws, Against my
                    crown, my oath, my dignity, Which princes, would they, may not disannul, My soul should sue as
                    advocate for thee. [xliv]
                    [766–7]
                  For slander lives upon succession, For ever hous’d
                  where it gets possession. [987] I’ll attach you by this officer. [1141–6(1)]; [1141] No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
                    [1142] A devil in an everlasting garment. [1145] A fellow all in buff.
                    [1149] One that, before the Judgement, carries poor souls to hell. [1151–2] He is ’rested on the case. [1153] Tell me at whose
                    suit. [1161] Was he arrested on a band?
                  [1168] If an[y] hour meet a sergeant. [1176] And a sergeant in the way.

                (3) General references: — [13] Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods. [1595] Against the laws and statutes of this town. [1172] Time is a very bankrupt. [1746] Why what an intricate impeach is this?
              
          

          Cuningham’s
            list is by far the longest on Err. alone, though he misses subbornd (1369) and
            perhaps others. Fripp (1921, pp. xlvi f.) canvasses the canon to support his assertion
            that Sh. had absorbed so much legal terminogy that terms, common and technical,
                flow from him unconsciously to the injury of his
              work. Many others gather more or less persuasive examples from the works
            to argue for Sh.’s technical expertise, or sometimes to argue that Bacon
            or someone else must have been responsible for the terminology. Phillips (1972) conveniently
            collects the commentary from Malone on. The following mention Err.,
            usually glossing terms; the most important are in the Commentary: Campbell (1859, pp. 44–6), Fuller (1862, pp.
            10–11), Davis
            (1883, pp. 132–3), Heard (1883, pp. 41–4, 69–70, 84), Castle (1897, pp. 210–28), Devecmon (1899, pp.
            40–1), Rushton
            (1907, pp. 10, 28–9), White (1911, pp. 190–7), Underhill (1916, 1:391–2), Barton (1929, pp. 61–6), Clarkson &amp; Warren (1942, pp. 47, 86–7, 132), Keeton (1967, pp. 89–90), Knight (1979, pp.
            77–9), Sams

            General Comments

            For Rouse’s
              (1912) calculation of how doubling the twins multiplies the mistaken meetings, see
                .

            Matthews
              (1913, p. 70), thinking LLL precedes Err., praises the plot, which LLL lacks, and
              suggests that perhaps Sh. wanted Err. to be free from
                this defect [of action] at least. . . . Entangled as the characters are in the
                deliberately contrived complications, the action is transparent to the spectator,
                who gains an added pleasure from his superior knowledge hidden from the persons of
                the play. He praises the handling of the intricacy of the structure.

            Fisher (1931,
              pp. 102–3, 158) on good expositions in the early comedies: They are
                astonishingly clear and concise, and whatever may be the faults of the first
                exposition in The Comedy of Errors, it is a marvel of
                concision and clarity; perhaps indeed, it is too compact for complete theatrical
                  comprehension. . . . [103] There is little time for people
                who are late to the theatre. . . . To miss the first scene of The
                  Comedy of Errors is to miss half the contrast and suspense of the middle
                sections of the play and almost all of the surprise of the denouement.

            Denouements in comedy tend to assemble the whole cast, but usually (p. 158)
                the denouement . . . is essentially brought about by one person. . . . The
                errors might have continued in spite of the truth had not Antipholus of Syracuse
                simply appeared. When all the bewildered people gather to see him, the truth sweeps
                over them.

            Sprague
              (1935, pp. 116, 126, 128): That Shakespeare, even in the days of his
                apprenticeship as a playwright, was capable of writing good first scenes, is
                shown . . . in The Comedy of Errors.

            Likewise the ending is good (p. 126): Pooling their knowledge, the
                bewildered characters go over everything that has occurred, and the
                  repetition in narrative of matters already seen in action [William
                Archer, Play-Making, 1912, p. 75] is one of the most
                amusing passages in the whole play. . . . 

            [128] Shakespeare’s usual way of paying his
                respects to verisimilitude is to introduce a simple statement . . . postponing the
                detailed discussion of what has happened. . . . At the end . . . the Abbess
                invites the other characters [quotes 1884–5]. The formula—for it amounts to that—is a
                useful one. It is realistic in a small way . . . it serves to get the characters
                off the stage at the end of a comedy, just as the funeral procession gets them off
                at the end of a tragedy.

            For Elliott’s
              (1939–40) comment on structure mingled with his emphasis on weirdness,
              see .

            Evans (1960,
              pp. 1–3, 7–9) on Sh.’s reliance upon exploitable gaps or discrepancies
                among the awarenesses of participants and between the awarenesses of participants
                and audience. . . . 

            
              To describe the creation, maintenance, and exploitation of the gaps
                that separate the participants’ awarenesses and ours in The Comedy
                  of Errors is almost to describe the entire play, for in his first comedy
                Shakespeare came nearer than ever afterward to placing his whole reliance upon an
                arrangement of discrepant awarenesses. . . . Comic effect emerges not once from
                character as such. If the Dromios prove laughable, it is not in themselves but in
                the incompleteness of their vision of situation that they prove so. . . . [2] With neither character nor language making notable comic
                contribution . . . the great resource of laughter is the exploitable gulf spread
                between the participants’ understanding and ours.
            

            
              This gap is held open from beginning to end: it is available for
                exploitation and is exploited during ten of the eleven scenes. In the course of the
                action we hold an advantage of awareness over fifteen of the sixteen persons—Aemilia
                alone never being exhibited on a level beneath ours. . . . 
            

            The key fact that is quickly revealed to us is denied Aegeon
              and the two sets of twins: they are ignorant that all are in the same
                city.

            Evans
              explains the effect of this discrepant awareness on Err. and
              how it differs from other plays. He also makes the point that there is no
                practiser (p. 3): No one here wilfully deceives
                another or even passively withholds a secret—for none here knows enough of the
                situation to deceive others about it, and none has a secret to
                withhold. . . . 

            [7] In these various ways . . . Shakespeare
                worked to make it credible that the participants should continue, throughout the
                bustling action, to be abused by error; that is to say, thus he kept open for his
                uses the exploitable gap from which rise the comic effects.
              Various ways involve keeping action credible, which he does by having
              S. Antipholus fear the sorcery of Ephesus and distrust his sanity and by having
              Adriana focus on her endangered marriage.

            However, his addition of the frame story . . . greatly complicated . . . the
                system of awarenesses which prevails throughout the play. It also profoundly affects
                our view of the farcical scenes. The tragic note of Aegeon’s opening speech
              and the Duke’s pity there, and the remarks of the Merchant to S. Antipholus in 1.2
              should affect us.

            [8] If the heavy emphasis given it [i.e.,
                pity] is indicative of intention, Shakespeare meant the painful sound to be carried
                in our memories through all the fun until we meet Aegeon again, on his way to
                execution.

            We are thus obliged to observe the comic action . . . while our
                minds hold a spot of anxiety for Aegeon. This method becomes a
                regular formula.

            But just this once, he withholds not only from the participants but from us also an all-important fact: he hides a
                key. . . . When we learn that there is an Abbess in Ephesus and that this Abbess is
                no other than old Aegeon’s lost wife, the play is within eighty lines of the end.
                Had we been told of her existence at the outset, we would have been
                assured . . . that all would finally be well.

            Sh. (p. 9) has simply deceived us, as he would do again only in WT.

            Brooks (1961,
              pp. 55–8): The Comedy of Errors has its large dramatic
                design, but it is no less remarkable for its controlled detail, unparalleled at this
                date, except in The Spanish Tragedy, outside Shakespeare’s
                other plays. His handling of the lesser units of structure, from the scene
                downwards, is already sure, and indeed within its conventions brilliant. These units
                include the scene, a new one beginning whenever the stage is clear; the sub-scene,
                or scène as understood in French
                drama, a new one beginning whenever the group on stage is altered by anyone leaving
                or joining it; the passage of dialogue or the set speech, more than one, sometimes,
                going to make up the scène; besides
                every physical action, whether procession, brawl, or bit of minor
              business.

            He gives a detailed analysis of 1.2. (P. 56): Shakespeare has already
                the art of fulfilling, and with the economy that secures dramatic compression, three
                principal requirements of dramatic structure: retrospect, preparation, and immediate
                interest. By retrospect and preparation the playwright keeps his action moving—the
                great virtue of dynamic or progressive structure—with the strongest continuity.
                Further, while he concerns himself with the matter of the present scene, he can add
                force and meaning to what has gone before, and pile them up for what is to come
                after, so that, in effect, he is building up several (perhaps widely separated)
                parts of his play at once. . . . 

            
              With the first entry and speech of [1.2], there is interest in the
                appearance of three fresh persons, and some tension: Antipholus the alien is warned
                that he is in danger of the fate which overtook Egeon in the scene before; a fate
                summarized in the natural course of the warning. This retrospect, and parallel of
                situation, link the opening of the main action and that of the Egeon action within
                which it is to be framed. The link is strengthened by reference to three themes
                already started in the Egeon episode: risk (and in particular the hazards of
                Ephesus), wealth and time. Egeon, Antipholus is told:  . . . not being able to buy out his life According to the statute of the
                  town Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. [167–9] Since these themes
                will be developed throughout the main action, the references to them are preparatory
                no less than retrospective. The theme of moneyed wealth is emphasized by
                stage-business: the merchant hands back to Antipholus  . . . your money that
                  I had to keep, and Antipholus passes it on to Dromio. The bag of money is
                to [57] furnish one of the two subjects of the first comic
                misunderstanding, due to occur later in the scene, and therefore is implanted
                visually on the audience’s mind beforehand; moreover, it will form a parallel with
                the gold chain and the purse, other concrete visible properties which carry on the
                theme and become foci of similar cross-purposes in subsequent Acts. The second
                subject of the imminent misunderstanding, the summons to dinner by the Ephesian
                Dromio, is also prepared, and the time-theme touched, in Antipholus’ observation:
                  Within this hour it will be dinner-time [173]. Another chief theme . . . is introduced when he is
                warned to conceal his Syracusan origin; for this concerns his identity. Again, when
                he bids Dromio depart with his money, Dromio’s exit lines: [quotes 179–80] foreshadow
                the suspicion that his master will shortly entertain, while preparing us to
                recognize it as groundless, a comic error. The rendezvous arranged, at the Centaur,
                leads to the reunion of master and servant in II.ii.
            

            
              Dromio’s jesting exit ends the first scène. It is Shakespeare’s cue for underlining the promise
                of comedy: the note of tension at the start has now passed into the background. It
                is the cue also for Antipholus’ direct comment upon Dromio’s character, which adds
                to what has been gathered of his own and of the relations between the two of them.
                The audience’s present curiosity about them is gratified, and its appetite whetted,
                both together; for the promise of comedy is contained in the informative comment
                itself: [quotes 182–4], jests, it is clear, which are very timely. Antipholus’ experience
                of Dromio as a jester is needed to explain his coming assumption that the invitation
                to dinner is his servant’s joke, and his slowly mounting surprise and anger when it
                is persisted in out of season. The rendezvous with the merchant, at five
                  o’clock, like that arranged in scène I with Dromio, helps to establish the theme of timing, and the
                motifs of timely or untimely meetings or failures to meet. It points forward,
                moreover, to the hour (cp. [1587]) so
                fateful for Egeon, the hour (though we do not [58] yet know
                this) of the dénouement; somewhat as
                the mention of dinnertime in scène I
                began to make ready for the dinner episode (III. i), the play’s central
                pivot.
            

            
              The scènes of three,
                then two persons, are succeeded by Antipholus’ first soliloquy. Here and in the two
                remaining scènes, the immediate
                interest for the audience strengthens. From the point of view of comedy and the
                intrigue, scène 4, the encounter with
                the wrong Dromio, is the climax of the whole scene. It is flanked, in the ABA form
                so frequent in Shakespeare, by Antipholus’ soliloquies, which are the imaginative
                climaxes, and, together with the moment when he strikes (the Ephesian) Dromio, the
                emotional climaxes too, though there is contrast between his emotion as an
                exasperated and as a melancholy imaginative man. From the
                imaginative, introspective man he is, soliloquies (his brother has none) come
                naturally; his allusion to his care and melancholy has prepared the
                way for them.
            

            For Wells
              (1963) on the structural aspects of character manipulation in relation to the date of
              composition, see .

            Frye (1965,
              pp. 106–7): The primary reason for this speech [1310–20] is not to rouse sympathy
                for the servant, though this is a secondary reason, and relevant to the context. The
                primary reason . . . is structural. The structure of [The] Comedy of Errors is a
                metamorphosis structure, a descent into illusion and an emer­[107]gence into recognition. The main action takes place in a world of
                illusion and assumed madness; the imagery of the final recognition scene suggests a
                passing through death into a new world. Not only is Aegeon delivered from death at
                the very moment of his execution, but the Ephesus twins are imprisoned in a
                  dark and dankish vault [1724],
                by a living dead man [1718] with no face. They escape by gnawing through their bonds, and the
                symbolism of this is at once pounced on by Dromio of Ephesus: [quotes 1768–70]. The Duke’s
                remark, I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup [1747], and his comment when the twins meet, One of
                  these men is Genius of the other [1817], fill out the same metamorphosis pattern.

            Wells (1966,
              pp. 104 ff.) explores how the delayed identification of the Abbess as the one who can
              clear up all the remaining mysteries affects the play (p. 105): The very fact
                that the Abbess is a new character appearing at what is obviously a very late stage
                in the play arouses the audience’s expectations. Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus
                are on-stage already. The Abbess brings with her their Syracusian counterparts, so
                the pairs of twins are seen together for the first time. Obviously a solution is
                imminent; but we do not know how it is to be brought about. For a moment confusion
                seems worse confounded. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me
                  [1816], says Adriana. Antipholus of
                Syracuse recognises his father; but the next (and major) recognition comes
                unexpectedly from the one character we know nothing about. The Abbess recognises
                Egeon as her husband, and thus reveals herself as the mother of one pair of twins.
                The implications of the revelation are unfolded in an episode of some length,
                allowing the audience to recover from its surprise (which may cause laughter) and to
                share in the different reactions of the characters as they readjust themselves to
                the happily changed situation.
              Idem (1986,
              pp. 267–71) repeats most of this material with an emphasis on staging.

            Hawkins
              (1967, p. 65) joins Err., LLL,
                Ado, and TN as belonging to
                what . . . I shall call the alternate pattern, whose distinctive
                mark is unity of place. These plays are alternative to Northrop Frye’s
              comedies that he calls green world comedies, which contrast two
              locales; Hawkins describes similarities in the four plays.

            Petronella
              (1974, pp. 481–4): Err.
              needs to be studied for the way it employs the structural pattern of
                separation and union—a pattern that . . . informs the language, characterization,
                and action of The Comedy of Errors in a way that has not
                been explored in the past. . . . Separation is represented by references to, and
                acts of, severing, untying, releasing, divorcing, freeing, and losing; these are
                balanced by different representations of union: binding, tying, fastening, uniting,
                confining, and finding. . . . Separation . . . becomes associated . . . with
                categories such as illogicality, chaos, and domestic dissolution; whereas union is
                linked with logic, order, and domestic stability. . . . 

            
              The play’s solid base [is] made up of four interlocking levels of
                reality: family, commerce, state, and cosmos. The last of these does not have as
                prominent a role as do the first three; nevertheless, it is
                present. . . . The social situation (commerce and state) is not [as?] central to
                the play’s meaning as is the domestic. . . . The principal search is for the
                natural bonds that hold a family together as well as a search for individual members
                of that family. In a more general way all four levels are marked by a drive toward
                overcoming [482] estrangement or division.
            

            Petronella
              begins by noting that Egeon, entering bound and reentering bound in Act 5, becomes (p.
              483) an emblem for the idea of confinement, especially as it applies
                to the level of state. . . . 

            
              At the level of commerce the word bond is obviously
                significant. But . . . the word also suggests binding, arresting, or pulling
                together toward union. All of these suggestions are supported by two symbolic
                objects: the controversial gold chain . . . and the rope.
            

            He furnishes an example (p. 484): State, commerce, and family are all part of
                the action in Act IV, Scene 4. Here are an arresting Officer (representing the order
                of state), the Courtesan (representing her particular brand of commercial
                interests), and two sisters. . . . The Officer has Antipholus of Ephesus
                figuratively bound by legal arrest, Dromio of Ephesus comes in with the by now
                ridiculous rope, and the three women . . . bring in Dr. Pinch . . . to separate
                Antipholus from the devil. If binding and separating were ever made farcical, here
                it is as robustly done as could be imagined. . . . The Ephesian Antipholus and
                Dromio were bound to their domestic responsibilities when we first saw them; now
                they are literally bound by the state and by Pinch’s would-be assistants in the
                absurd exorcism, which includes literal binding.

            Leary (1977,
              pp. 44, 47) marks the symmetries in Err.: All those
                combinations of parallels, balances, correspondences, echoings . . . which delight
                the eye and ear and mind because they satisfy our peculiarly human rage for
                order.

            Everything comes in pairs. He counts (p. 47) some eighteen principal
                errors scattered through the nine scenes [1.1 and 5.1 excluded], and these come at
                intervals that are spaced with remarkable evenness. There are three distinct sets of
                properties identifying each set of twins—six properties in all. . . . Evenly spaced
                speeches [recapitulate] what has just transpired, designed to keep everything clear
                to the . . . audience, who must never be permitted to share the confusions of the
                participants. The few scenes that border on romantic love (between Antipholus of
                Syracuse and Luciana) are followed hard by mock-romantic scenes or lines to provide
                the kind of symmetrical contrast that Shakespeare will use
              [later]. . . . 

            [48] Rime and meter are surely the most obvious components of linguistic
                symmetry. One-fifth of this play’s lines rime—a proportion exceeded in only three of
                all the rest of Shakespeare’s plays. . . . Patterns of alternating rime, as well as
                the more familiar riming couplets, appear, illustrating two kinds of
                symmetry.

            In addition to these sound effects, symmetry
                appears in the sense of the language as well. The pun, which is by definition a wedding of sound and sense in
                symmetrical pattern, is everywhere in this play. He adds question and
              answer, pro and con arguments, cause-and-effect statements, the cheerful and
                primitive pastime of name calling, and vituperation, all without
              illustration.

            Girard
              (1981), opposing structuralist analysis based on binary differentiation, asks what it
              is about identical twins that makes them so popular in the theater and indeed in the
              myths that lie behind theater. (P. 69): In The Comedy of
                  Errors, and more generally in all comedies of twins, the characters deal
                with each other on the assumption that all of them are unique and immediately
                identifiable as such. If they did not cling to this assumption in the face of
                contrary evidence they would not become so confused. It takes more than the presence
                of undistinguishable twins . . . to generate the comic effects; it takes this
                persistent refusal to acknowledge the possibility of beings, human or divine,
                [being] less different from each other than we would like them to be.

            Paradoxically, he says, while characters—he is generalizing about comedies and
              tragedies—act on the basis of differences, they really are trying to imitate each
              other until they become xerox copies (p. 70) of each other, as the
              twins are in Err.

            (P. 75): Too much presumption of difference, too much appetite for
                difference precipitates the loss of whatever difference there was in the first
                place, with consequences that can be comic or tragic according to the manner in
                which they are treated. The perpetual disappointment of expectations alienates the
                characters from each other and even from themselves.

            
              The moment comes when the characters undergo a breakdown of personal
                identity. Then, any one of them can exclaim, Am I myself, are the others
                  themselves? In The Comedy of Errors this moment
                occurs at the same critical point as in the other plays. Dromio asks his master,
                  Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio, Am I your man, Am I myself? [864–5]. . . . 
            

            [77] Ultimately, undifferentiation spreads to
                the entire city. Twins and non-twins alike are turned loose into the streets
                screaming and fighting insanely. Then comes the recognition scene, just in time to
                avoid a real disaster.

            Finally (p. 85), The extreme frequency of twins in most mythologies does not
                go without saying. It calls for some explanation. When a myth resorts to twins, it
                must be trying to make a point and this point cannot be the difference between the
                twins, otherwise why resort to twins? The point is obviously the absence of
                difference. The Comedy of Errors is more fun than
                structuralism.

            Grennan
              (1980, pp. 150 ff.) uses Luciana’s speech on order (290–9) and her pragmatic advice to S.
              Antipholus (791–4)
              to show that the dialectic of nature and custom variously repeated in
                the theme, structure, and language . . . offers, for all its sober overtones, a way
                into the play that is true to its textual and theatrical possibilities, and provides
                yet another hint of the integrity and continuity of Shakespeare’s imaginative
                vision. . . . 

            [152] The mainspring of the comic action is a
                conflict between what is customary (or . . . conventional) and what is
                natural, where nature is Hooker’s that manner of working which God
                hath set for each created thing to keepe.

            Grennan gives
              examples: the law that condemns Egeon is (custom [153]
                carried to its dogmatic extremity), and the natural sympathy evoked by the pathetic
                figure of the condemned old man; the overtly civil conversation
                between Antipholus of Syracuse and the First Merchant in 1.2 marked
                by the mannerly tone of polite social gesture (I crave your pardon,
                please you,
                Sir, I commend you to your own content ([189–95]). Left alone, however,
                Antipholus utters a speech that unravels the tightly woven fabric of this secure
                social world, replacing its fixity, its confident conventional identity with his own
                mysterious sensation of non-being: [quotes 199–202]. Such undermining of the customary world
                continues to the end of the scene. Dromio’s breathless language and behavior must
                seem to Antipholus to be anarchic, natural. They erode the
                conventional master-slave relationship.

            And so on for most of the play: Adriana’s misery is natural, Luciana’s response
              conventional, E. Antipholus’s violence at being locked out is natural, Angelo’s
              response conventional.

            As to language, it (p. 156) mirrors [the] action, offering its own equivalent
                of the structural pattern. Even a superficial reading . . . immediately reveals how
                conventional its linguistic and poetic elements are. Egeon’s opening speech
              is a (p. 157) conventional narratio, grounded in Aeneas’s account to Dido, its blank verse
              is regular.

            (P. 158): Common to all these uses of language is an assumption that the forms
                employed and the statements made will immediately and in the way intended by the
                speakers be decipherable by the listeners. Even when the speakers are at odds with
                one another they use the language in essentially the same way. Both formally and
                substantively, therefore, language in such cases is being used according to custom
                and according to conventional shared beliefs about its secure relationship with
                non-linguistic reality—the world to which it refers.

            However, at every turn we see the orderliness of conventional verbal
                forms sabotaged by the linguistic anarchy of the pun. For while the formal presence
                of the pun is a conventional comic device, its actual function within the fictional
                world is a reminder of the natural ambivalence inherent in experience. . . . The
                conflict between conventional uses of language and the pun re-enacts in linguistic
                terms the dialectical relationship of custom and nature observable in the
                action. . . . 

            [160] With the entrance of the
                Abbess . . . the dialectic of custom and nature in the language and the
                action . . . achieves its synthesis. She is immediately recognized as a
              figure of authority by the characters, who cluster around her silently. In
                questioning Adriana about her husband . . . she shows rich insight and an openness
                to natural feelings: [quotes 1516–21]. Her tone throughout is humane and
                understanding; her authority, like her [161] verse, is
                flexible in natural ways. Sin, the customary way of looking at Antipholus’s behavior
                  (possession in Pinch’s terminology), is mitigated by a sorrow that
                speaks of her concern for a human being. In the same way her rebuke of Adriana’s
                jealousy is not the reduction of a living woman to a conventional caricature (like
                her Plautine original, and as Luciana and Antipholus of Ephesus see her), but an
                accurate assessment of the pragmatic particulars. . . . As the sequence progresses
                we see that the Abbess combines unaffectedly the qualities of custom and
                nature by refusing Adriana’s conventional wifely desire to take care of her
              husband, insisting on her religious duty to intervene to make the man
              whole. . . . 

            
              Herself a perfect fusion of nature (mother) and custom (nun), it is appropriate
                that she bring the action to a concluding synthesis of the two. We may call that
                synthesis grace. That we will not take such grace too heavily, however, we have a
                lighter reflection of it in [162] the final exit, reserved
                for the Dromios. Between them as they leave, they good-humoredly dissolve the social
                convention of precedence . . . departing like brother and brother, /
                   . . . hand in hand, not one before another [1917–18].
            

            For Shaw’s
              (1980) analysis using the notion of Terence’s contaminatio, see .

            Hirsh (1981,
              pp. 14–15) sees in 4.4 that S. Antipholus follows E. Antipholus, narrowly missing him
              onstage. Thus, at the height of the confusion, the solution—that is, a
                face-to-face encounter between the twins—seems closer than it ever has. But
              there was an even closer one. At the beginning of Act III, scene ii,
                the Syracusan Antipholus enters with Luciana just after his Ephesian twin
                left . . . to end the previous scene; no time has elapsed, and no change of
                location has occurred. While thirteen lines separate the exit of one brother from
                the entrance of the other in Act IV, scene iv, no lines intervene here. In actual
                clock time the Antipholi miss each other [in 3.2] by only a second or less, while
                about half a minute must separate them in the later case. Yet I am sure that the
                audience’s sense that the brothers nearly ran into one another is much stronger in
                the next-to-last scene than at the beginning of Act III, scene ii. It is our
                automatic tendency to compartmentalize two scenes, rather than the conscious
                deduction that such an encounter could not occur at the earlier point, that is the
                key to this difference in our responses to the two incidents. . . . 

            I propose that the present division of Shake­[15]speare’s plays into acts and scenes be replaced by the division of the
                plays simply into scenes numbered sequentially. That is the context for
              detailed scenic study.

            Jagendorf
              (1984, pp. 114–15) analyzes a few of the patterns of endings that seem
                characteristic of Shakespeare’s art.

            Whereas Plautus’s beginning and ending are alike in tone—The absurd happy
                ending is implicit in the absurd data of the start, Sh.’s dark beginning
                makes us aware . . . of a repeated pattern of separation, search, and return
                that links the exposition of past events with the action of the play proper and thus
                adds a color of necessity or at least probability to the discoveries of the final
                  scene. . . . [115] This trick of exposition makes of the
                play’s beginning the end of a catastrophic cycle that the ensuing action imitates in
                a farcical manner, penetrates with analogical threads of seriousness, and completes
                happily. The pathetic, slow-paced search of father for sons and brother for brother
                is continued as the increasingly hectic chase across the stage of the characters
                fleeing from or searching for each other. [Quotes 862–7]. The narrated history of the
                loving family split up by the storms of fortune is acted out from a new perspective
                in the troubled marriage of Antipholus and Adriana, which is threatened by
                faithlessness . . . [quotes 514–18]. Such correspondences between pathetic
                exposition and largely farcical action give the play an inner shape that is
                reinforced by the time scheme and the use of place.

            Maguire
              (1997, pp. 356–7): It is impossible to talk about The
                  Comedy of Errors without invoking duality, polarity, antithesis,
                symbiosis, fusion, binary oppositions. Shakespeare combines Pauline and Plautine
                sources, mixing one of antiquity’s most spiritual writers with one of its most
                salacious. He gives us two kinds of supernatural power, the prestidigitatory
                exorcisms of Dr. Pinch and the holistic religion of the Abbess. He explores two
                kinds of personality loss, the negative in the fragmentation caused by grief, the
                positive in the sublimation of love. Lodgings are characterised by division and
                duality: the Centaur (half man, half beast) and the Phoenix (death and rebirth).
                There are two lock-out scenes, one each for husband (Antipholus of Ephesus) and
                wife. Emendations by Hanmer and Johnson notwithstanding, the play ends most
                fittingly, as it began, with a double birth [quotes 1894–6]. Who deciphers
                  them? [1819] asks the Duke of
                the two Antipholi, adopting a verb from reading practice, the compare-and-contrast
                exercise of the interpretive critic, the collation work of the editor. The
                characters come only belatedly to a critical mode forced upon the audience from the
                beginning.

            
              Egeon’s romance narrative frames the central scenes of
                farce. . . . The Antipholus twins . . . have antimeric experiences: Antipholus of
                Syracuse has a delightful dream, Antipholus of Ephesus a
                  nightmare [quoting Hamilton, 1967, p. 96]; Antipholus of Syracuse is afraid
                of foreigners, Antipholus of Ephesus is disoriented by a domestic threat; Antipholus
                of Syracuse is welcomed and recognized, Antipholus of Ephesus is rejected and
                denied. These inverse parallels also find expression within individual characters.
                Thus, Adriana catalogues her husband’s faults but concedes, I think him
                  better than I say ([1131]);
                Luciana has two speeches on marital relations, the first of which offers a text-book
                  [357] defence of female subservience, the second a
                  picture less of cosmic determinism than circumstantial pragmatism [quoting
                  Grennan,
                1980, p. 151].
            

            Appropriately, the linguistic medium . . . is paradox and the pun
                (those figures wherein two opposites co-exist) and duplication . . . antithesis,
                anaphora, chiasmus. She gives examples such as 1182, 36, 50.

            The following also comment on structure: Charlton (1931; 1938, pp. 47, 64–5); Jacobi (1937, pp.
              51 ff.) rather mechanically works through the various errors as conflicts. The war
              between the Ephesian men and women is short and sharp. He also marks the high degree
              of parallelism in the play; Ridley (1937, pp. 53–4) praises the slick handling of
              the action, especially the delayed introduction of E. Antipholus; Traversi (1960, p. 9); Smith (1966, p.
              21): What is less often noticed [than the mere duplication of twins] is that
                the successive episodes of mistaken identity follow an almost mathematical pattern
                of permutations and combinations between the inner group of four, consisting of the
                twins, and the outer group of six, consisting of Balthazar, Angelo . . . , the
                First Merchant, Adriana, Luciana, and the Courtesan, until, in the final scenes, the
                complications so proliferate as to include the minor characters of the main plot and
                those concerned mainly with the frame story; Adams (2000, pp. 73–89) discusses
              the various recognitions in the last scene.

          





          
            Unities

            Sh.’s following the neoclassic rules of the unity of time (the action to be completed
              in a day) and place (the action to be limited to a single locale) is noticed.

            Gildon (1710,
              7:299): This Play is exactly regular, as any one may see who will examine it by
                the Rules. The Place is part of one Town, the Time within the Artificial Day; and
                the Action the finding the lost Brother, &amp;c.

            Elliott
              (1939–40, pp. 96–7): I think that in sheer composition this drama
                surpasses most of his early works and some of his mature ones. It testifies that
                this poet . . . set his heart at the outset upon achieving wholeness of
                form. . . . Compared with [Bartholomew Fair] The Comedy of Errors, by a young and
                  non-classical writer, is a beautifully carved
              gem. . . . 

            [97] Obviously he was free from the pedantic
                notion that this device [unity of time and place] is an essential principle of
                drama. But he saw that the outward sort of unity, observed strictly or
                approximately, could be an aid to inward form. And he saw that a strict observance
                was demanded by the material and mood of The Comedy of
                  Errors. [Unified structure fits the whole emotional pattern of the play.]
                An initial mood of swift and strange, almost weird, romance is saturated, as the
                play proceeds with fun that is swift, strange, weird. Thus the romance and the fun
                are congruent.

            Leech (Ephesus, 1964, p. 156): Almost inevitably Shakespeare kept
                the place single and the time that of one day, and it was indeed a good thing that
                he did so. The audience’s readiness to accept the action depends largely on the
                restriction of time: on a second day of wandering in Ephesus, the twins—particularly
                Antipholus of Syracuse, who is after all seeking his brother—would have solved the
                problem on their own, by deduction or by a simple encounter. For the space of a few
                hours we can accept that they might not actually meet, might not have time to think.
                And, if the play was to be primarily concerned with a series of mistakes, the
                dramatist must be able to give room for them . . . : consequently, the action must
                be in a single town for at least the greater part of the play. Shakespeare achieves
                neatness and a sense of continuous speed by locating the whole of it
              there.

            Framing Structure

            Many if not most commentators have something to say about the Egeon-Æmilia romance
              narrative that frames Err. See n. 35–142. The following are special studies devoted to the
              frame.

            Gaw (Evolution, 1926, pp. 628–9) finds five dramaturgic functions for
              the frame story: 1. The frame . . . substitutes [for Plautus’s
                Prologue] an organic exposition in dramatic dialogue within the play proper. And
                this exposition is strongly motivated. By command of the Duke, the father, in peril
                of his life, relates the story of his sons and the cause of his own wanderings. The
                scene ends effectively, with sentence imposed but temporarily suspended.

            [629] 2. The frame is here an effective device
                for promoting plot unity. Without it the internal plot . . . impresses one as a
                rather loosely knit series of comic happenings. The frame gives a firm beginning and
                a firm, definite, and massive ending. That this is somewhat contrasted in tone with
                the misadventures that form the main plot merely, from this point of view, increases
                its effectiveness.

            
              3. By its tone of romantic tragicomedy the frame also combines with
                other elements . . . to lift the Plautan farce into an atmosphere of greater
                dignity.
            

            
              4. The frame increases the general happiness of the ending. Among the
                many points which it adjusts we may note the reunion of the Antipholuses, the curing
                of Adriana’s jealousy, the clearing up of the triangle situation between the two
                Dromios and Luce, the pairing off of Luciana with Antipholus of Syracuse, the
                release of the father from his imprisonment, and the reunion of the mother with her
                two sons and her husband.
            

            5. The effectiveness of the conclusion is enhanced by
                surprise by the appearance of the Abbess.

            Willson
              (1977, pp. 12–13): Though Egeon’s narration is indeed flat, the scene
                need not be: its context is one of trial, judgment, and sentencing, wherein the
                victim must be granted our indulgence. Egeon’s role . . . is created to give a
                tragic [13] overcast to the comic business of mistaken
                identity. . . . Shakespeare’s own stamp and the taste of his audience account for
                this somber beginning, as well as for the mixing of mirth and melancholy in the play
                proper.

            
              A long, flat, and colourless speech may
                be necessary for other reasons, not immediately perceived if we use only the
                expository criterion. Egeon is seen only at the beginning and again at the end of
                this short play: his presence obviously a framework of poignancy and standard of
                misfortune standing in contrast to the [?]advented absurdities of the twins’
                story.
            

            Peterson
              (1995, pp. 37 ff.) studies a compositional schema in many plays: In each instance a threat of death initiates the main action. . . . Each
                threat is followed . . . by a sudden and radical shift in dramatic focus. Egeon is
                left behind [quotes 160–1], while we follow his son, Antipholus of Syracuse, into what seems to
                him to be a strange and dream-like world of inexplicable
                occurrences. . . . 

            [38] The result . . . is a play consisting of
                two distinct and radically different kinds of action, each with its own beginning
                and ending, and with one enframing the other. The enframing actions are recognizable
                as common to the world we leave behind when we enter the theater to be free for a
                time of its claims. . . . The enframed actions on the other hand, are playful and
                even farcical and are set in places where the laws of verisimilitude and
                probability, along with clocktime itself, have been set aside.

            He finds this pattern, the mimetic frame and the ludic
              enframed (p. 39), at least as old as the secular drama itself. The
              first instructs, the second entertains.

            (P. 42): The result [in Err.] is two comedies in one,
                a diverting interval of ludic recreation and a rare and
                  wonderful fiction which offers . . . a more substantial form of
                recreation in the form of an exemplary pattern. Each comic action, moreover, as a
                result of Shakespeare’s enframing the ludic within the mimetic, serves the purpose
                of the other. Once underway, the interval of mirth and game
                completely engages the audience’s attention until the errors out of which it
                develops have been discovered. For this ludic interval of escape from [43] the world of everyday the story of Egeon serves simply as a
                frame or transitional fiction. Once the Egeon story comes full circle
                in the final reunion scene, the relationship between the two is reversed. Now the
                merry tale of mistaken identities is not only subordinate; when viewed from the
                perspective established by the reunions scene, it actually serves the purpose of the
                exemplary tale of loss and recovery by serving as a parodic opposite for the
                  perfect pattern that is figured forth in the
                reunion. It is hard to know whom he is quoting; not Err.

            The ludic plot always fulfills its purpose as a diverting recreation. The
                other comedy is conceptual. It requires . . . wonder and reflection. Reflection
                leads, finally, to a recognition of the recreational value of Egeon’s
                reunion with his wife and sons. A father, assured of heirs, no longer despairs. His
                sons in being reborn have regained fully their identities and are
                ready, in turn—one through an impending marriage, the other through a marriage
                restored to harmony—to participate in the communal life of Ephesus and
                Syracuse.

          





          
            Five-Act Structure

            One issue about structure is that of the so-called five-act structure, that is,
              whether Err., like other public playhouse plays before about
              1606, was written according to the neoclassic analysis of Terence’s plays, was
              numbered by the author or some other person, and was acted with pauses or
              continuously. The most recent review is Taylor &amp; Jowett
              (1993).

            Baldwin
              (ed. 1928, pp. xxvi ff.) had not yet articulated what he came to call the Terentian
              formula, but he analyzes the plot firmly in terms of acts. He summarizes the plot of
              Acts 1 and 2, showing how they set up the frame story and the first errors. Then (p.
              xxviii): This third act is the heart of the play, with all the preceding action
                preparing for it, and all the succeeding action flowing from it. This is the regular
                situation in one of Shakespeare’s plays, since it is here that he places the turning
                point in his action. He probably means all of Sh.’s
              plays.

            (P. xxix): Since . . . the central idea is a series of errors leading to
                eventual recognition, then we must have the first narrowly avoided recognition in
                the third act. Incidentally, a second narrowly avoided one occurs in the fourth act
                [4.4, characteristically not identified here or when he gives the plot summary for
                4.4], and the recognition in the fifth, this idea and theory forming the backbone of
                the play. But the error thread is only the main one; the others must
                also be treated in the same way. The third act is thus the place to begin the love
                of Antipholus of Syracuse for Luciana, which seems hopeless in the fourth, but ends
                successfully in the fifth. Conversely, the third act is the place to bring the
                forces opposed to the predetermined ending to their highest point. Thus we have the
                break of Antipholus of Ephesus with . . . Adriana appearing in the third act.
                Naturally, then, we have Adriana’s side of the break emphasized in the fourth act,
                and the reconciliation in the fifth. Also, Antipholus of Syracuse here decides to
                leave Ephesus, a decision that must not be put into effect if the story is to end
                properly. . . . Thus with the given materials Shakespeare’s theory of construction
                naturally determined what should be placed in the third act. Indirectly, it also
                determined what should be in the first and second, since they must prepare for the
                third. It is not easy to judge whether this mechanical process, laid forth
              so repetitiously, was the result of Baldwin’s writing a school text, or whether it came
              from his regular style, to be seen in book after book.

            Idem (1947,
              pp. 315, 579, 682–3, 703, 706–14) restricts his interest to the first point above,
              demonstrating with great erudition that Sh. learned to construct his plays on a
              five-act structure taught in the humanist commentaries on Terence that formed part of
              the grammar school curriculum of the day. I quote him at length because he spent so
              much of his career on Err. and because summary is nearly
              impossible. Specifically, this structure, which he calls the Terentian
                formula, consists of the protasis, or introduction, usually
              the first two acts; the epitasis,
              the most busie parte of a comedie (Cooper, 1565), again usually two
              acts; and the catastrophe, the resolution in the final act. Baldwin shows
              beyond any doubt that these terms were taught to, alluded to and recognized by at
              least the boys who learned Terence when they were about nine years old.

            Before turning to Terence, on pp. 682–3, writing about the influence of the biblical
                Acts 19 as a source that caused Sh. to set Err. in Ephesus, Baldwin observes that each of the first four acts ends with S.
              Antipholus becoming increasingly determined to escape the witchcraft he thinks is
              being exerted on him. (Here Baldwin does not insist that these repetitions mark a
              five-act structure; he does insist on this in Genetics, 1965,
              pp. 73–87, however.)

            (P. 579): It appears probable that Shakspere had the conventional drill on
                Terence in grammar school, and that this drill would include some knowledge of the
                current five-act formula for the plays of Terence. When later Shakspere himself
                wrote plays, did he use any form of this five-act theory? I propose now to examine
                from this point of view the structure of three of Shakspere’s early comedies [LLL, Err., TGV]. I believe that approximately in their original form structurally
                these are Shakspere’s three earliest surviving comedies, and that they were written,
                as their structure itself will show, in the order given above.

            It is not Baldwin’s way to move by straightforward exposition. He argues that
                LLL was written first because it is a too-mechanical
              following of Terentian three-part structure and of the highly symmetrical pairings of
              Lyly’s Endimion.

            (P. 703): But it will be noticed also that the shaping influence upon
                the structure of The Comedy was the five-act formula. The
                particular variety used here . . . finds its first printed statement . . . in an
                edition of Terence without date but known to have been printed in 1550. The edition
                and the ideas are really those of Iodocus Willichius, but it is his pupil Gregorius
                Wagnerus who in his preface . . . phrases the formula with application to Andria. . . . 

            [706] &lt;I, 1&gt; The first scene is merely a
                prologue to give the setting for the play and to prepare for the reunited family at
                the end of the fifth act. [707] Father Aegeon is chosen to be
                the prologue and comes very near to being that constantly defined thing in Terentian
                criticism a protactica persona, since
                he is dismissed till the catastrophe. He summarizes the scene.

            Sh. is following Terence’s Andria, with its commentary by
              Willichius. This structure is pointedly Terentian. Contemporaries
                would have considered that Shakspere had carefully observed Terentian structure
                here.

            &lt;I,2&gt; The play proper now begins with the arrival of Antipholus
                of Syracuse in search of his mother and brother—though no [708] one seems to have been much interested in mother, and mother appears to
                have reciprocated; in other words, mother has not been worked into the main story
                either; the play has been merely fringed with romance, the romance has not been
                woven in. He summarizes the content.

            It will be seen that Shakspere has discarded the first act of Menaechmi and has developed ideas from the first two scenes of the second
                act into his first act. This mixing of the Terentian formula with the
              manipulating of Menaechmi continues.

            Having analyzed 3.1 (p. 710): The issue is now joined. Some
                explanation must now eventually be forthcoming, though the first approach to
                recognition has failed. Here is the beginning of the epitasis exactly at its
                hallowed place, the beginning of the third act.

            
              With the epitasis begun, our next major objective is the end of the
                fourth act, for at its end must be prepared the remedy for the great ills, so that
                this remedy may be administered in the catastrophe of the fifth act. . . . 
            

            
              We must now begin to work toward this formula-determined objective of
                the third act.
            

            Having analyzed each scene in this fashion, he concludes (p. 713), I suppose
                the reader will need no further demonstration from me to be convinced that Shakspere
                has very pointedly and exactly shaped this comedy on the Andria formula.

            What he skips over is the stage direction at 1473, nine lines into Act 5: Enter Antipholus and Dromio
                againe, where the againe is normally taken to be Sh.’s
              indication that the action is continuous rather than broken by the Actus Quintus heading; but see Taylor &amp; Jowett, 1993, p. 45
              n.: But Antipholus and Dromio could never have been onstage for the first 8 ll.
                of the scene, and in an authorial MS the againe probably indicates continuous writing rather than continuous
                performance.

            Err.’s structure, Baldwin continues, is pure Terence, even pure
              Terence of the Andria, though based on Plautus’s Menaechmi with the insertion of the shut-out scene that lies at
              the heart of the Amphitruo. Here is the best, most expert
              example of a play built on a structural formula (p. 714): It may not be
                amiss . . . to point out why The Comedy appears to be so
                much more mature a play in its structure than many of those which followed it. The
                reason is that Shakspere is here working in a well-understood type, according to
                rules which had already been long since clearly formulated and taught.

            Chambers
              (1930, 1:307): The stage-direction ([1473]), Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe suggests that the
                action was continuous throughout and the F division into acts uncalled for, since
                these characters left the stage at the end of Act iv.

            Greg (1955,
              p. 201): An unoriginal division into acts only has been introduced, perhaps at
                the time of printing, since the unusual direction at [1473], Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe,
                after their exit at the end of Act IV, shows that the action was meant to be
                continuous.

            Brooks (1961,
              pp. 69–70): So far as the plot is concerned, this organization corresponds, T.
                W. Baldwin has shown, to the five-act structure Renaissance and earlier critics
                found in Terence; particularly the form found in the Andria. How far it depends upon neo-classical theory is perhaps a question:
                among the features Baldwin indicates, those of most consequence for dramatic effect
                can be paralleled in a mediaeval drama like The Castle of
                  Perseverance, and to a playwright well-endowed with structural sense might
                seem natural, theory or no theory, in plays with a central crisis and a final
                solution. However this may be, the comedy begins in medias res, with the partial exposition of what has
                happened already, and the immediate occasions of the subsidiary and main actions:
                the suspended sentence on Egeon and the summons to the wrong Antipholus. Act II
                completes the exposition and protasis
                by introducing the sisters and their motivation, especially Adriana’s; and ends,
                when the [70] same Antipholus accedes to her summons, with
                the beginning of the epitasis or
                entanglement proper. This leads to the central crisis in III. i: locked out, the
                husband is brought into the entanglement, and narrowly fails to meet his twin:
                despite the Dromios’ scolding-match, recognition is missed. By the last words of Act
                IV, with the firm resolve of the alien to depart, there is imminent danger it will
                be missed for ever; and there follows in the supposed madness of the twins and the
                expiration of Egeon’s respite, the climax of distresses that precipitates the
                  dénouement. There, meeting and
                recognition are combined with the completion and correction of Egeon’s retrospect:
                  Why here begins his morning story right [1832].

            Talbert
              (1963, pp. 143–9) fits a detailed explanation of the mistakes-errors to the Terentian
              scheme detailed by Baldwin.

            In Genetics (1965, pp. 73–87), Compositional Genetics of the Five-Act Structure of Errors, Baldwin repeats much of what he had written in 1947.

            Mincoff
              (1965, p. 922) is doubtful that Sh. was much impressed by Horace’s demand for
                five acts, rehearsing the mixed evidence from choruses in Rom. and the induction in Shr.: All this
                does not suggest any very enthusiastic adherence to the doctrine of five acts,
                though neither does it point to open disregard of it. It is when we come to the
                details of Shakespeare’s structure that we see that the classical models can
                scarcely have taught him very much. He compares Menaechmi’s late developing structure with Sh.’s early one as an example of
              Sh.’s independent control of complicated plotting.

            Nevo (1980,
              pp. 1–10): Out of his Renaissance Roman and Renaissance romance
                materials Shakespeare wrought a form of comedy unmistakably his own. It is the
                function of two inconstant variables: the Donatan formula for comic plots, which
                serves as model for a multitude of variations; and the battle of the sexes which
                constitutes the underlying motivation of his variegated romantic-courtship stories.
                The formula was derived by the fourth century grammarian Donatus from his study of
                Terence and ceaselessly re­[2]peated. . . . Comedy, the formula runs, ought
                  indeed to be five-parted, the first which unfolds the argument . . .  (in
                another version: contains either the peril, the anguish or some
                  trouble); the second completes the same. The third has the
                  increment of turbations and contentions . . .  (or: brings on the
                  perturbations, and the impediments and despair of the desired thing);
                  the fourth seeks a medicine for the turbations (or: brings a
                  remedy for the impending evil) and is a preparation for the
                  catastrophe, which the fifth demands by right for
              itself. . . . 

            
              The telos of this Terentian plot is the
                finding—discovery or recovery—of what was missing, that is, imperfect, at the
                start.
            

            In Terence and Plautus the characters have very specific goals. (P. 3): The ends that are finally brought about are consonant with the original
                desires of the protagonists, but in excess of them. They get more, and better, than
                they bargained for, and this on account of a series of fortunate coincidences and
                discoveries . . . the lucky chances of which, in our precarious existences, we are
                in direr need than of any gift of birth or intellect.

            
              These stratagems of the New Comedy supplied Europe with its comic
                fictions for two millennia. . . . They . . . provided Shakespeare with his plots
                from The Comedy of Errors to The
                  Tempest. . . . 
            

            [4] In the early Comedy of
                  Errors just such a Menandrine narrative of separation and reunion encases
                the brisk Plautine mistakings and unmaskings of the Menaechmi; and this has tempted criticism to become preoccupied with the
                question whether the meandering romance narrative of marvelous reunions (Apollonius of Tyre, for instance) or the tight Roman structure
                of mistakes and [5] unravellings took precedence in
                Shakespeare’s imagination. The fact of the matter is that both were contained in
                Plautus, and the historical bifurcation into medieval romances on the one hand and
                dramas of intrigue on the other is largely a matter of theatrical convenience. The
                plays foreground the tangle of errors; the romances—they have the time to do
                so—foreground the precedent vicissitudes. . . . However, in application to
                Shakespeare, a further parameter comes into play.

            
              After the initial sally of The Comedy of
                  Errors the wandering narrative of long-lost children and family disappears
                [until Twelfth Night]. . . . 
            

            [6] The telos of Shakespeare’s early comic
                plots then is recovery: the finding of what was missing or lacking at the start. And
                here the first great novelty is at once apparent—Shakespeare’s protagonists do not
                know what they want, except in the most superficial sense. They discover as they go
                along, and so transform the rather arid Donatan scheme into a heuristic device of
                immense potency and flexibility. When his protagonists, like the Romans in their
                happy ends, get more than they bargained for, it is not simply a bonus (admittedly
                considerable) of a son’s light of love turning out to be respectable . . . but an
                illumination of their entire lives. . . . 

            [8] Shakespeare’s implementation of the
                Terentian scheme (in the first ten comedies) runs as follows.

            
              Whatever the predicament sets forth as missing at the start, be it a
                twin . . . it will be found. The plot’s formal coherence depends on this, and so
                does the audience’s perception of the play’s coherence. Since . . . the
                protagonists are themselves seekers, and only partly, or not at all cognizant of
                what they seek, the formal development is a continual, unfolding process of
                disclosure, during which, however, the protagonist and the audience are proceeding
                at different rates, that of the protagonist being positively retarded by tumults and
                confusions on the way, that of the audience proceeding apace by inferences and
                hypotheses.
            

            
              Therefore, when the plot is finally resolved by some appropriate
                recognition which enables the objectives to be attained, the anagnorisis is retrospective as well
                as immediate for the protagonist and holistic or integrative for the audience. The
                recognition invites in effect a second order or interpretative, re-evaluative
                reading of events for both. . . . Scales fall from the protagonists’
                eyes. . . . The manifest purposes, desires, goals and motivations of the
                protagonists reveal their inner, previously concealed, or veiled, or latent
                implications.
            

            In New Comedy the trickster slave is the author of the plot intrigue. (P. 9): In Shakespeare trickery has gone up in the world [no longer dependent on
                the utilitarian tricksters]. . . . The freeing of the comic device . . . has great
                advantages for variety and flexibility. In The Comedy of
                  Errors the comic device is nature’s own—the freakish identicalness of
                twins—but thereafter we have psychological one-upmanship [Wiv., etc.]. . . . 

            The comic device meshes in marvellously intricate, varied and
                eye-opening ways with the comic disposition of human beings to be deluded, deceived,
                mistaken, unreasonable, perverse, irrational and subject to every kind of folly.
                This produces what the neoclassical theorists of the Renaissance, following Donatus,
                called the incrementum processusque
                  turbarum, the increase and procession of perturbations, or the
                  forward progress of the turmoils. The device then exhausts itself,
              no more can be done with it, and remedies take over.

            (P. 10): But as they [the remedies] close the gap opened by the play’s
                beginning, they provide the audience with means for a full and final retrospective
                intelligence of the nature, in all its inwardness, of the desirable, the
                pleasurable, the good, the absence of which motivated the story. Because she
              extends the New Comedy pattern to all ten early comedies, her conclusions are richer
              for the whole series than for Err., which she locates
              first.

            Tetzeli von
                Rosador (1984, pp. 13–17) studies the plotting from an Aristotelian and
              Terentian point of view, denying that plot is a negligible aspect, less regarded than
              structure, theme, and character: Neither for Aristotle nor for the Terentian
                theorists from Donatus to Scaliger is the meaning of plot confined to a rational
                ordering of subject-matter. All of them conceive of plot as having—and this is the
                basic assumption of this essay—a thematic dimension and an inexorable movement
                forward. The latter is inherent in the [14] axiom of
                necessary sequence, in . . . the dictum that a play must have a beginning, a
                middle, and an end. . . . [Turbae,
                the complications of the plot, are to begin as early as the protasis.] Thus the protasis is not only intended to impart introductory information about
                the play’s setting and characters but also has to awaken the audience’s
                expectations. Even retrospection . . . must make the spectator look ahead; not only
                the end of the play but also the movement towards it must be contained within the
                beginning. . . . [The dramatist must master the art of] precipitation, of preparing
                a concerted forward movement.

            He analyzes Egeon’s opening speech to find in the references to a lost family that
              will certainly be found again the necessary expectation, comic precipitation.

            (P. 15): But it is above all the plotting of Egeon’s life-story and of the
                first scene which by indirection ensures the audience that what they are watching is
                a comedy and which pitches their minds forward to a comic conclusion. Moreover, this
                is a kind of plotting which informs the rest of the play as well. The life of Egeon
                and his family from the moment they embark is patterned on a variant of the approved
                romance model of never-ceasing reversals from happiness to unhappiness to happiness.
                It consists of a plot-movement which, again and again, builds up dangers,
                unendurable suffering or mortal peril, only to bypass irrevocable consequences at
                the last possible moment. He recounts that movement in Egeon’s speech. Some
              later examples:

            
              The money Antipholus of Syracuse thinks lost soon turns up again (2.1 and 2.2);
                Antipholus of Ephesus eventually listens to advice and does not break into his own
                house by main force (3.1); Dromio of Syracuse escapes the claims of the monstrously
                spherical kitchen-wench, as does his master the siren-like enchantments of Luciana
                (3.2).
            

            He finds another pattern, an oscillation (p. 16) between . . . accelerando
                and ritardando. In 1.2 and 2.1 the easy introduction of stereotyped
                figures and the quiet unfolding of relevant themes are abruptly brought to an end
                through the entrance of another figure, in both scenes a servant. Now
                misunderstandings ensue and characterize the following part of each
                scene. . . . Both scenes close with rather meditative, subdued passages of thematic
                interest: Antipholus evokes the aura of magic . . . attributed to Ephesus ([263–7]) and Adriana
                pours out her jealous lament ([363–91]). This tripartite division remains the
                governing principle of scenic structure henceforward. Even if from the fourth act
                onwards the oscillation negates the scene divisions, the movement of the plot still
                pulsates regularly between turbulence and calm, is alternately speeded up and slowed
                down. (And appropriate changes of metre or movement between verse and prose
                underline these differences in scenic quality.)

            A danger of plotting by formula has to be averted. Shakespeare employs two
                plot strategies to counteract such mechanization. First, there is the repeated
                reporting of events dramatically presented earlier on. The Ephesian Dromio’s report
                  ([320–50]) of
                the meeting with his presumptive master in the market-place to fetch him home to
                dinner first instances this plot-device. The incident is related again . . . on
                three further occasions through three different speakers [402–14, 550–8, 624–33]. More than a third of the
                whole play is taken up by the narration of events which the spectator has [17] witnessed in the flesh. Most of 4.4 and 5.1 are
              largely given over to such reporting. These refractions of what has happened by
                those to whom it has happened provide glimpses of the suffering, jealous, choleric,
                greedy, mercantile humanity behind the swiftly moving plot. . . . The other
                strategy . . . consists in providing explanatory models for all the twists and
                turns of the plot . . . [quotes 263–8; 333].

            Riehle (1990,
              pp. 89–97), who is as adamant that Plautus influenced Sh. as Baldwin is that Terence
              did, does what he can to dismiss Baldwin’s Five-Act
              Structure; Riehle should be read for his counterargument.

            Taylor &amp; Jowett (1993, p. 45), who argue against act interval pauses in public playhouse plays before about 1606, though they
              accept Baldwin’s demonstration that such plays were written on a five-act plan, think
              that Err., because it was performed at Gray’s Inn and was
              perhaps composed for the revels there, is an example of authorial act dividing,
                without in any way reflecting early (or late) practice in the outdoor

          A recent approach to the play sees the audience in the theater as being forced to
            participate in the play. Shaw (1980, pp. 17–18, 21–6): The Comedy of
                Errors holds a place unique in the Shakespearean canon because it shows at
              once the most direct derivation from Roman comedy and, at the same time, an awareness
              of contemporary audience and occasion. This does not mean that the drama of the
              intervening years, particularly that of Renaissance Italy and the native English
              tradition, does not show its influence. Rather, there is something to be gained by
              looking at either end of a creative process—the pressure of Latin comedy at the
              beginning and the demands of occasion on performance at the end. If we can assume that
              this play as we have it in the Folio text shows signs of catering to an audience at
              least as learned as the playwright, then awareness of specific audience and perhaps
              also of the specific occasion of the Christmas revels at Gray’s Inn in December, 1594,
              encouraged Shakespeare to indulge in authorial virtuosity. . . . [I want to view the]
              play as an artistic performance whose comic success depends upon an [18] awareness of its deliberate eclecticism and of a craft expressly designed
              to set up a confrontation between stage representation and audience
              expectation.

          She notes that little of the play is in prose and that the Dromios use blank verse when
            they are getting beaten and that 629–746 is in rhymed couplets. Surely, the couching
              of such Plautine buffoonery in blank verse and rhyme suggests a conscious dichotomy
              for comic effect. Perhaps in this Shakespeare is following the lead of the courtly
              John Lyly . . . ; but if he is, then his audience would recognize the technique of
              imitation as well as the deliberate juxtaposition of action and speech
              pattern.

          She continues with Terentian expansion of plot by contaminatio and how Sh. enriches the tone of the play as well, taking his
            cue from Terence again.

          (P. 21): Adriana . . . prevents the serious concerns from swamping the
              whole play. . . . 

          [22] This view of Adriana should lead us to
              consider with a somewhat less serious eye the disputation on husband-wife relations in
              which she engages with Luciana. Adriana is clearly a crowd-pleaser, and perhaps her
              considerations of marriage are designed to titillate a sophisticated mixed
              audience. . . . Adriana takes a firm view; a man is unruly and
                feeds from home ([376–7]), and, therefore, a wife should be demanding and
              keep a tight rein. . . . [In The Brothers] Terence shows
              that the wisest course avoids the weakness of either extreme [of submission—Luciana’s
              position—or shrewishness], and surely this is what Adriana represents at the end of
              Shakespeare’s play and, regardless of what scripture says, the position that would
              most delight an audience at once aware of the stylistics of the argument and of the
              Terentian compromise.

          Finally, how to account for the ending, with the last words given to the Dromios, not
            to those of higher rank? And why is it such a short play? (P. 24): Per­[25]haps a plausible answer . . . is that the play
              as we have it . . . is the version designed to fit into the special entertainment [at
              Gray’s Inn]. . . . 

          
            There is reason to suspect that The Comedy of
                Errors was . . . meant to be followed by a masque.
          

          She reviews the Gesta description. Considering
              the progress of events to the disorder, the indication is that had the evening’s
              entertainment continued as planned, the presentment, procession to state, and
              ceremonial compliments would have been followed by a play and a
              masque. . . . 

          The end of The Comedy of Errors seems to
              support this suggestion. After the denouement—the discovering and sorting out of the
              Antipholi [26] and the Dromios and the joyous reunion of
              parents with children and brothers with brothers—the major characters, led by the
              Duke, withdraw from the stage to celebrate the happy occasion. The two
              servants . . . are left on stage to go through a series of burlesque gestures as to
              who will leave the stage first, finally agreeing: [quotes 1917–18]. This posturing is
              suggestive of an antic dance, one type of comic contrast that gave rise to the
              antimasque in the Court Masques and could have been intended as a prelude to the
              masque dances. These measures, if this were the case, would be performed by members of
              Gray’s Inn and their ladies taking the place of the professional actors for the dance
              finale. She is one of very few who take pains to argue how Err. fits into the evening of revels, though many say casually that it may
            have been written for Gray’s Inn.

          Huston (1981,
            pp. 14–18, 21, 27): He [Sh.] builds a plot of mistaking, self-consciously
              contrived, and then he exuberantly pushes his characters around the world he has
              trapped them in, all the while encouraging his audience, which knows the reason for
              the mistaking, to laugh with him at the characters’ vain efforts to understand their
              situation. This artifice, which keeps the audience separated from the play (he
            uses play as jeu as well
            as drama), makes it unnecessary to develop character.

          Yet (p. 15): In so addressing the audience, Shakespeare is, at least in
              part, attempting to extend the range of his mastery; he is including the audience, as
              well as players, stage, and props, in the world he controls. It is no wonder, then,
              that Shakespeare’s characteristic response to the members of his audience . . . is to
              manipulate them. He manipulates his characters too, and the relationships between
              these two kinds of manipulation variously define the worlds of Shakespeare’s comedies
              of play.

          
            In The Comedy of Errors . . . Shakespeare
              keeps his audience almost always at a distance from the action.
          

          We watch the action from a position of almost godlike superiority, while
            the characters try to make sense of what is happening to them by proposing hypotheses.
            Sh. simultaneously encourages his audience into the play and makes us keep our distance;
            we know nearly everything; the characters appear increasingly mechanical, leading to
            Bergson’s definition of comedy (p. 18), the mechanical imposing itself
              on the human.

          Almost. But not quite—because Shakespearean comedy is never as neat as
              a general critical summary would have it. He emphasizes the misleading
            beginning, analyzing 1.1 at length for all the discontinuities he finds,
            stating that discontinuity is thematic in the play.

          On lines 40–7 (p.
            21): Egeon claims that his wife would have been happy but for him and
              for the fact that their luck was bad, and then he says that they were joyfully married
              and prosperous. The argument makes no sense. Of course, we know what Egeon means: the
              sorrow came after he and his wife had been happily married for
              some time, when they were separated. But that is not what Egeon says. So overwhelmed
              is he by present grief that he makes it color even his account of past
              joy. . . . 

          
            And what Egeon does at the beginning . . . he does throughout: he tries
              to impose a perfect, uncomplicated continuity on the complex, discontinuous
              experiences of his life.
          

          After listing all other discontinuities—the errors—(p. 27) maddening,
              unassimilable discontinuity, expanding its compass and intensifying its attack,
              threatens everyone in Ephesus. . . . Clearly what is needed is the wonderful,
              restorative power of miracle, which comes in the figure of the Abbess.

          At last the playwright reveals to his characters the secret he has shared with
              his audience since the second scene. And in the process he dissolves, at least for a
              moment, the distance between audience and characters. . . . And as characters become
              temporarily an audience [listening to Emilia], Shakespeare’s audience may recognize
              that this situation is reversible—that an audience may be transformed into characters
              by a world more expansive than the one the playwright creates. So Sh. plays
            with his audience, of course surprising them with Emilia’s revelation. The effect of the
            play is to help prepare its audience to cope with the unmanageable discontinuities of
            their own lives.

          Homan (1986, p.
            32) makes the audience enact the anxieties of the play. An example of how we participate
            in the action: For them [the characters] even the most
              basic object, a prop like the rope or chain so solid it can be seen and touched,
              cannot be seen for what it is. The Ephesian Antipholus requests money and is brought a
              rope by his servant; Syracusan Antipholus finds his Dromio bringing not
              a rope as requested [sic; E. Antipholus sent for the rope] but gold, just as earlier
              he had received a chain without asking for one. . . . The characters . . . devise
              numerous interpretations of these strange events, even though all miss the
              mark.

          
            When we attach a meaning to such objects, if we see . . . a social or
              symbolic meaning to the chain . . . do we do anything less, however more consciously,
              than the stage’s confused characters? We ourselves thus confuse or
              exchange an object so that we can avoid mere spectacle, and thereby we sustain that
              delicate balance of the visual and the verbal essential to the theater.
          

          Wolfensperger (1994, pp. 13 ff.) offers a response-theory criticism:
              I shall look into the twin questions of how and in what thematic complexes
              Shakespeare avoids taking sides in order to guarantee the neutrality of his point of
              view and to leave the audience viewpoint indeterminate, and of how he seeks to clearly
              and unambiguously reveal his point of view and with it the viewpoint we are intended
              to adopt. My study can thus be seen as an attempt to reconcile deconstruction with
              orthodoxies and to bridge the gap between the two camps from the point of view of
              Shakespeare’s guiding of our response.

          He focuses on the sharp differences between critics’ sympathy or antipathy for Adriana
            (p. 21): What has been one of the most intriguing questions . . . is in
              what way Shakespeare guides our response in view of the crucial thematic concern of
              marital rights and duties. . . . 

          [26] How can one account for the contradictory
              responses? Who is to blame for this apparent critical free-wheeling?

          He concedes that attitudes toward women have changed in the past fifty years enough
            even to make a mark on predominantly male critics, but I do not want to leave the
              impression that the cause for these contradictory and shifting responses lies
              primarily with the recipient and his environment. Quite the reverse is the case. It is
              in the first instance the text itself [27] and its persuasive
              strategies that are responsible for the divergence of critical responses.

          Of 2.1, the debate between Adriana and Luciana on the role of men and women in
            marriage, he says that on the surface it seems that Luciana does no more than speak one
            orthodoxy, that of female submissiveness in marriage, and Adriana argue for another, one
            that opposes the double standard of morality and the analogy between husband-wife and
            master-servant. But he studies (p. 29) the comedy’s external system of
              communication that guides our response, for which see .

          Peterson (1995,
            pp. 43–4): But closure has been won only within an ideal fiction. Closure to the
              play itself remains for the audience to determine. The rejuvenation Egeon enjoys
              through a strange and wonderful turn of events, the audience is offered in the form of
              a rare and wonderful fiction. In the closing moments of
              that fiction the silent figure of Egeon bowled over by the unexpected revelations and
              recovery of wife and sons is a reminder to the audience that begetting children is a
              way of defeating mortality. For those who embrace the solution it offers, the Egeon
              story will have been authentically recreative. For those [44]
              who do not, the merry interval provided by the action it enframes may at least have
              proved a relaxing pastime.

          O’Brien (1996,
            §1): Shakespeare uses the possibility that Syracusan Antipholus is genuinely
              threatened by madness, and therefore death, to manipulate his audience’s
              anxieties. . . . Syracusan Antipholus’ descriptions of his transformed
              mind draw on specific, Elizabethan ideas about both supernatural and natural causes of
              madness.

          The supernatural is demonic possession, the natural is the physical infection from
            eyebeams carrying spiritual vapors that produce love melancholy. He associates the
            water-drop passages with other passages in Sh. that connect loss of self with water, and
            these he connects with (§5) Foucault’s statement (Madness and
              Civilization) that one thing at least is certain, water and madness
              have long been linked in the dreams of European man.

          He concludes (§26): The Comedy of Errors is not King Lear. Nevertheless, as I have argued here, this seeming farce
              touches upon what would have been a genuine anxiety for the Elizabethan audience.
              Syracusan Antipholus is struggling for his mind and his life when he cries
              out . . . [quotes 1224–6]. Such outcries are comic because the audience is aware of the cause
              of Syracusan Antipholus’ confusion. But however faint, the anxiety produced by fear of
              madness remains, darkening the play’s entertaining confusions.

          For support of his showing the seriousness of the physical cause of madness, he uses
            from OED a definition of error
              (fury . . . extravagance of passion), the last citation of which is
            1460.

          Gibbons (1997,
            pp. 111 ff.) finds Err.
            focussed on the dividing of an audience’s attention so that an episode can be
              understood from two opposite points of view simultaneously: a whole plot can have a
              double meaning apparent to an audience but not to the characters in the
            tradition of Renaissance serious play as found in Erasmus and More.

          (P. 121): The disorientation of the spectator (and the would-be interpreter) are
              the very first things Shakespeare concentrates on . . . in its first scene. The
              opening lines sound like the end of a play, as a long court hearing concludes with a
              judgement: Egeon declares Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall, / And by the
                doom of death end woes and all [5–6]. The impression that the case has been heard at
              some length seems confirmed by the Duke’s response: Merchant of Syracusa, plead
                no more [7] and by Egeon’s
              answer, which repeats the stress on a long process terminating: Yet this my
                comfort, when your words are done, / My woes end likewise with the evening
                sun [30–1]. The Duke brings matters to a close with perfunctory courtesy:
                Well, Syracusan, say in brief . . .  [32]. Only with an effort can Egeon manage a reply at all:
              he sounds worn out: A heavier task could not have been impos’d / Than I to
                speak my griefs unspeakable [35–6]. So, a wordless valediction and a finis? What
              happened to the rest of the play? The spectators, put off-balance in this way, are
              disconcerted again when the apparently exhausted Egeon embarks buoyantly on his story
              with the leisured amplitude of someone who has all the time in the world. He proceeds
              for an unhesitating sixty-four lines, then briefly pauses—O let me say no
                more [97]—but only for
              rhetorical effect, while the Duke, having before enjoined brevity, is now egging him
              on: [quotes 99]. Twenty-two lines later,
              Egeon’s narrative still shows no signs of arriving at the present; meanwhile the Duke
              is settling down for a story he clearly feels is only just getting into its
                stride—Do me the favour to dilate at full ([125]). That it should be just at this point that Egeon runs
              out of steam (he can only manage fifteen lines more) is a further droll Shakespearian
              touch.

          He remarks that the play, in its dramatization of (p. 118) a providential
              pilgrimage that moves from a nativity to a last judgement . . . must also,
              simultaneously, be seen as the reverse. In the
              Pauline-Christian terms of rebirth (It is sowen a naturall body, it riseth a
                spirituall body,
              1 Corinthians 15, 44)—it moves from a last judgement to a nativity.

        





        
          Symbolic Properties

          Tillyard (1965, pp. 64–6): I must digress about the use
              Shakespeare makes of gold, which is very frequently mentioned in the play. The motive
              of the gold chain . . . first enters at the end of the first scene of act two. Here
              Adriana tells her sister that her husband has [65] promised her
              the gold chain. She then proceeds to moralize about gold in lines which unfortunately
              are corrupt. . . . It is at least clear that gold is solid and will stand up to
              rubbing in the way that mere surface enamel will not: [quotes 385–7]. . . . But the gold chain
              behaves in a way alien to the solidity from which it is fashioned. It eludes its true
              owner, it leads to all kinds of mistakes, and the man to whom it is given in error
              enjoys it as one of a number of things of whose existence he is doubtful. In fact,
              though Antipholus does not actually state it, the chain for him is fairy-gold and
              might wither away to nothing at any moment. No sooner has the wrong Antipholus got the
              chain than (IV, i) we see a merchant pressing the goldsmith for a debt . . . [quotes
                997–1000]. The
              rope is a substitute for the chain he would have [66] given,
              had his wife behaved herself. But it is more than that, for it was no accident that
              the rope enters the play in a context of gold. As gold keeps on attaching itself to
              Antipholus of Syracuse, so ropes attach themselves, metaphorically and literally, to
              Antipholus of Ephesus. As the latter fails to get the chain that belongs to him and
              later the gold that should set him free from bonds, so does he get the rope’s end he
              has ordered and must submit to be bound by ropes in a way he had not bargained for. In
              fact, gold and rope are contrasted symbols of what the two brothers experience; and
              there is a delightful irony in the younger brother’s distrusting the first, and the
              elder brother’s not welcoming the second.

          For Henze’s
            (1971) explication of the thematic significance of the chain, see  above.

          Berry (1972,
            pp. 35–7): The mechanism by which two sets of actors relate to each
              other is the exchange of money and the chain. These concrete objects become the foci
              of crosspurposes. . . . The physical/verbal emphasis is consistent:
                chain occurs 45 times, and gold (with compounds) 32
              times. They compose an early test case for Shakespearean symbolism. . . . What does
                gold, with chain, signify?

          
            The first law of Shakespearean symbolism is that it is never forced. The
              symbolic implications flow easily and naturally from the literal object (or activity),
              which itself appears to emerge inevitably from the course of the play. . . . In
                The Comedy of Errors the use made of gold
              (and money, and chain) compels two questions: what are
              the natural associations of gold, and what associations are especially
              generated in the context of the play?
          

          
            The second question dominates the first, for gold, [36] clearly, has tremendous positive and negative
              potentialities. . . . In The Comedy of Errors, it is plainly
              regarded as an instrument of communication. . . . 
          

          
            One has to avoid a stock response to gold (and also,
                chain) as something with innate criminal tendencies. Now in this
              play, no one uses gold as a means of expressing personality, or
              of controlling others. It is purely a mode of doing business, and (for Adriana) of
              confirming that a promise will be kept. . . . The recent critical tendency to allow
              the obvious implications of chain to wander into the field, designated
              as Adriana’s possessiveness has little foundation in the text. For
              Adriana’s [37] attitude is stated in her first reference to it:
              [quotes 382]; and the word promise, with its associations of bond-holding and oath-keeping
              is the major underlying concept. If Adriana had harped on chain more
              than the others, one could allow a certain associative transference, but in fact she
              does not. I see no ironic juxtaposition of personal and commercial values in this
              play.
          

          Bruster (1992,
            pp. 75–7): E. Antipholus owes Angelo the cost of the chain. Goldsmiths, in
              Shakespeare’s age . . . were more than craftsmen. In the vacuum of formal financial
              establishments . . . they frequently assumed the role of [76]
              bankers. . . . In agreeing to fashion the chain, and in delivering it to the man he
              thinks is the Ephesian Antipholus, Angelo makes a form of loan; the breaking of this
              obligation violates a civil agreement. Shakespeare intensifies the chain’s
              significance as a symbol of civic and professional responsibility . . . by
              constructing another social obligation, that of Angelo’s debt to the Second Merchant
              of Ephesus. . . . Where Plautus was satisfied with what one might call
                simple dramatic confusion, Shakespeare multiplies the line of
              dependency, suggesting . . . that discord on one level of society—that is, the
              familial and marital—translates into the breakdown of convention along others: here,
              the professional/commercial. . . . [77] Just as this scene,
              with its temporal urgency and confusion of identity, goes a significant distance
              toward encapsulating the action of the play itself, so is the golden chain—in its
              concatenation of wife, courtesan, goldsmith, merchant, and brother—a piece of
              dramaturgical currency emblematic of larger issues in the drama.

          Dawson &amp; Yachnin (2001) offer essays in which one argues with the
            other about whether to understand the Elizabethan theater (p. 2) on the more or
              less local situation . . . , finding a new understanding of theatrical pleasure in a
              study of the early modern idea of the person, the practice and theory
              of acting, the humoral model of the body, and the sacrament of the Eucharist
            (Dawson) or by locating it in the longue
                durée of western cultural history, looking especially at the long-term
              consequences of the stage’s project of self-definition within the early modern luxury
              market (Yachnin). Dawson writes about the chain in response to Yachnin’s
            comments on the fetishizing of Desdemona’s handkerchief (p. 140): The
              chain is a commodity, a fact that is frequently emphasized in the play, most obviously
              in relation to the money it costs and the many references to its possible or actual
              circulation (from Angelo to Antipholus of Ephesus, to the Courtesan, to Antipholus of
              Ephesus again, to Adriana, and tangentially, but crucially, to Antipholus of
              Syracuse); not to mention the fact that the payment for it is presented as the
              necessary means of bailing the goldsmith out of bondage both to the Merchant who
              appears in 4.1 and to the sergeant at law. It is clear that Ephesus is a [141] deeply commercial city, dedicated to the circulation of
              capital and rife with merchants and ducats, prepared even to forgive its mortal
              enemies if they can ante up a sufficient amount of cash.

          
            The commercial circulation of the chain is disturbed when it goes to
              Antipholus of Syracuse rather than Antipholus of Ephesus, a derailment that is not
              sorted out until the very end when, as the text suggests, the foreign twin hands it
              over to the native brother. When he first receives it, Antipholus of Syracuse
              transforms what is really a simple commercial transaction into a fortunate
                golden gift ([977]), of a
              piece with the other mysterious goings-on that lead him throughout the play to
              expatiate on the sometimes dangerous, sometimes enticing mysteries of Ephesus, its
                mists ([612, mist]) and madness, its witches and sorcerers ([265–6]). In other
              words, he fetishizes the chain, mystifying its actual commodity value . . . ; but the
              play as a whole takes comic pleasure in showing just how wrong he is. One indication
              of the real social origin of the chain is the fact, emphasized in the play and
              exploited as a source of the errors of the plot, that it is actually being forged as
              the action is proceeding. . . . 
          

          
            Hence the detour via the wrong Antipholus that the chain makes serves a
              double purpose—it leads to a theatrical highlighting of the delusive, magical potency
              of the chain, and to a demystifying of that potency through an insistence on the
              chain’s commercial and artisanal origins. The audience is made aware of the careful
              process of producing luxury items such as jewelry. . . . And the psychological and
              cultural tendency to give such commodities more weight than they can easily bear is
              thereby brought into question, comically deconstructed by the chain’s circu­[142]lation. The demystifying process is abetted by the audience’s
              more or less unconscious awareness that the gold chain is really just a
              prop, probably made of lead or paste, not gold.
          

          
            But still, the chain remains a potent theatrical object—first of all by
              virtue of being highlighted on stage, and secondly as an agent of the cunning process
              of mystification/demystification and, we might add, re-mystification, that the text
              puts into operation. What I mean by this last point is that for all the insistence on
              the commercial foundation of the chain and its circulation, it remains a powerfully
              associative object, linked to the multiple bonds between brothers, between parents and
              children, between husbands and wives—i.e. to those primal sources of feeling to which
              Shakespeare returns again and again in his plays. . . . The play with the chain is an
              instance of theatrical self-promotion, deriving from a delighted recognition that it
              is the theatre, not the market, that confers a charge on objects as they appear on
              stage. To think of it in this way is to shift attention from Yachnin’s broad claim
              that Shakespearean investment in objects like the handkerchief is part of a long
              historical process whereby literature is born out of the theatre’s exploitation of the
              status system, to a more modest and historically specific claim that the theatre, in
              taking over and transforming cultural discourses, heightens its own representational power.
          

          Others who do more than just mention the fact of the chain are Snider (1876; 1887, pp. 68–9):
              The third principle [after family and state] which is involved in this
              entanglement is business—the commercial relations of the community. . . . The matter
              [of not paying for the chain] is at first treated as a jest, then it grows serious,
              and at last an officer is called in to enforce the demand. Here Authority is drawn
              into the meshes, and is victimized by an [69]
              appearance. . . . Public order is disturbed [and the resolution must begin]. But the
              difficulty cannot rest here; the abbess has defied the Family in the wife, and the Law
              in the officer; the conflict can only be settled by an appeal to the supreme authority
              of the land. But the Duke is likewise deluded, and all is clarified by the
            recognition of the twins; Brown (1957, p. 54); Cutts (1968, pp. 18–19); Hamilton (1992, p. 78): The golden
            chain represents a catena, a collection
            of explanations about theological matters, usually Roman Catholic but made newly popular
            in Richard Perkins’s A golden chain, 1591, Latin 1590; Kinney (in Mowat &amp; Werstine, ed. 1996, pp. 184–5): The property
                fetish that has been seen as the basis for the English common law in the
              period suggests that the gold chain . . . was just the sort of acquisition that
              Londoners themselves focused on; both identity and status depended increasingly on
              one’s material goods. Because the society was more and more cognizant that what one
                was was largely determined by what one owned, the chief emphasis in The Comedy of Errors on
                [185] possessions, on being possessed (by marriage,
              witchcraft, or grace), and on being dispossessed unites the play’s Ephesus with
              Shakespeare’s London.

          Closely connected to the imagery involving the golden chain is that of the rope and its
            power to bind as well as to flog. Egeon enters perhaps bound in 1.1, and certainly
            reenters bound in 5.1 (see 1823). E.
            Antipholus and his Dromio are bound in 4.4 (after 1394), only to have Antipholus gnaw their way free (1726). In 4.1 E. Antipholus sends Dromio to buy a rope’s end
            to punish Adriana for locking him out of his house (998).

        





        
          Language and Style

          See Metrical Tests () and
            Shakespeare’s Development (), for
            essays that look at specifics of style in seeking to establish the date or chronology of
              Err. The following are more general comments on the style of
            the play.

          Dowden (1875,
            p. 59): As characteristic of these early plays, we may notice, (i), frequency of
              rhyme, in various arrangements: (a), rhymed couplets; (b), rhymed quatrains; (c), the sextain,
              consisting of an alternately rhyming quatrain, followed by a couplet (the arrangement
              of the last six lines of Shakspere’s sonnets). (ii), Occurrence of rhymed doggrel
              verse in two forms, (a), very short lines, and (b), very long lines. (iii), Comparative infrequency of the
              feminine (or double) ending; (iv), comparative infrequency of the weak ending; (v),
              comparative infrequency of the unstopped line; (vi), regular internal structure of the
              line; extra syllables seldom packed into the verse; (vii), frequency of classical
              allusions; (viii), frequency of puns and conceits; (ix), wit and imagery drawn out in
              detail to the point of exhaustion; (x), clowns who are, by comparison with the later
              comic characters, outstanding persons in the play told off specially for clownage;
              (xi), the presence of termagant or shrewish women; (xii), soliloquies addressed rather
              to the audience (to explain the business of the piece or the motives of the actors),
              than to the speaker’s self; (xiii), symmetry in the grouping of persons.

          For Van Doren’s
            (1939) dislike of the style in Err., see .

          Hubbell (1958,
            pp. 66 ff.) has a general appreciation of the variety of verse.

          For Elam’s
            (1984) speech-act study of the language of the comedies, see .

          Newman (1985,
            pp. 4, 44, 80–1): Soliloquies and monologic fragments . . . individualize
              Shakespeare’s characters and endow them with motive and intention, conflict and
              complexity. In other words, they communicate a mental life which we perceive as
              lifelike far more effectively than simple description of a psychic event. To
              communicate the sense of a character’s inner life requires a different mode of
              presentation. Monologues must be made to look and sound like dialogue, which
            best presents the illusion of mental activity.

          Plautus has been overlooked as a model for imbuing monologue with
            the characteristics of dialogue to give the speaker a mental life, using rhetorical
            questions, objectification of the self in second- or third-person self-references, and
            paradox. These rhetorical devices occur whenever identity is a serious thematic concern
            or when it is parodied.

          These devices she demonstrates in Plautus and Terence, beginning with Amphitryo [her sp.] 404–8 (p. 44): Didn’t our ship arrive this very
              night from Perse Harbour, and me on it? Didn’t my master send me here? Aren’t I
              standing in front of our own house, and so forth, where Sosia is speaking to
            his double, the disguised Mercury; she gives further examples of the rhetorical items
            and devices, drawn mostly from Pseudolus, and then in Err.

          Of 575–81 (p. 80), We find the series of rhetorical questions characteristic of
              such speeches which set up the I/you dichotomy of dialogue. The switch from the first
              to the third person, from I to our . . . includes the
              audience in the errors and mistakes which Antipholus experiences. The inverted syntax
              of sleep I now and the oxymoron sure uncertainty signal
              an unhomogeneous structure of answer and response.

          Of 608–12 (p. 81): Shakespeare uses rhetorical schema to represent his divided
              mind: antitheses ([609]), anaphora, and
              chiasmus ([610]). . . . These lines show
              Antipholus learning that identity depends at least in part on others’ conceptions of
              him: on self, but as Adriana has suggested in her speech, on others as
            well.

          Charney (1993,
            p. 5): The variety and unpredictability of the verse in The Comedy of Errors is noteworthy.

          
            One final example of the extraordinary test flights of verse . . . is
              the long, hyperbolic description launched by Dromio of Syracuse of the officer who has
              arrested his master: [quotes 1142–7]. The hyperboles continue for a few more lines,
              then are taken up again in the next scene for another sixteen lines ([1200–15—prose]). The
              Officer, who is described so elaborately, has no real role in the play but only acts
              as the vehicle of hyperbole. Shakespeare seems to be enjoying himself with verbal
              pyrotechnics, which he imagined to be an intrinsic part of a classical style.
          

          Wells (1994, p.
            57): Although much of it is written in verse of considerable virtuosity
                The Comedy of Errors is one of Shakespeare’s least
              obviously poetical plays. In it his verbal powers are fully at the service of his
              overall dramatic aims. Often the situations require no more than swift, economical
              writing, carrying us along briskly from one comic point to the next. But Shakespeare,
              already a master of dramatic rhythm, knew that the pace would become wearisome if it
              remained unvaried. From time to time he relaxes the pace of the ongoing action to
              allow the inclusion of passages of comic writing in which the situation is not
              advanced but enlarged upon. Such is Dromio of Syracuse’s brilliant description of the
              kitchen wench who, mistaking him for his twin, presses her attentions upon him:
              [quotes 886–91]. . . . [Dromio’s] comic catechism . . . preserves the comic tone
              while giving us a rest from following the complications of the action. Equally
              brilliant in a different way is Antipholus of Ephesus’s description of Dr Pinch and
              his efforts to cure him of his supposed madness: [quotes 1712–17].

          In its matching of style to content, its dramatic economy, its tautness
              of construction, and its bold interfusion of farce with romance, The
                Comedy of Errors has claims to be considered as Shakespeare’s first real
              masterpiece.
            Wells places
              Err. after TGV and Shr.

          For Foster’s
            (1997, pp. 128 ff.) use of a computer database, Shaxicon, that focuses on
              Shakespeare’s rare vocabulary, see .

          O’Donnell
            (1997) has the best, most thorough analysis of the verse; he concludes (p. 419)
              The peculiarity of the verse of The Comedy of
              Errors—its variety, changes of pace and rhythm, its foregrounding of sound
              through rhymes, puns, figures of speech, and other means—may help to explain in part
              why so many directors from the early nineteenth century to the present have seen
              fit . . . to jazz it up. The play is . . . a virtuoso display of the
              phonetic resources of the language. It insists on putting eye and ear in tension with
              one another, and therefore creates many of its effects through what may be described
              as an embarrassment of aesthetic riches. . . . Read or performed with some attention
              to the precise nature of its exhibitionistic versification . . . The
                Comedy of Errors reveals a surprisingly sophisticated internal
              musicality.

        

      




      
        Characters




        
          The Characters in General

          Moore (1925,
            pp. 128 ff.) finds Err. tedious even in performance, though an
            improvement on other Plautine imitations, chiefly Mother
            Bombie. Sh. does depend even more egregiously than Plautus upon the comic
              value of mere activity—jumping, running, whirling, dodging.

          He notes the (p. 129) tragic relief.
            We are told that Shakespeare gave real individuality to each Antipholus (as
              Plautus did not), and to each Dromio. . . . It is a hard thing to discover these
              individualities. . . . The differentiation between the brothers amounts mainly to
              this—one is married and one is not.

          Sh.’s superiority to Lyly is marked (p. 130) notably in the matter of putting in
              the mouths of different types of persons different types of speech. Pages or
              servant-boys, in Lyly, speak with rather more show of education and intellectual
              equipment than their masters. Shakespeare’s Dromios speak and think like Dromios, not
              like Antipholuses. From this very difference, it comes about that Shakespeare’s play
              has vastly more comic realization than Lyly’s.

          Cazamian (1952,
            p. 194) on the result of the abandonment of reality in farce: One intimation of
              this confessed unreality . . . is that the characters are more or less aware of it.
              Their reactions when faced with the painful or ridiculous consequences to themselves
              of an absurd imbroglio are not quite those of flesh-and-blood people under the shrewd
              or humiliating blows of fortune; they grow most amusing when most persecuted by fate.
              The paradox . . . is very cleverly managed, and each participant in the general
              make-believe preserves his idiosyncrasies too well not to remain individual and
              convincing. But it is plain, at the same time, that everybody is out to make the huge
              joke a success. He calls Err. a pleasant,
              though not deep comedy of character.

          Cutts (1968,
            pp. 20–1): The characters . . . are fundamentally incapable of seeing beyond the
              outward appearances which serve to complicate and confuse the management of their
              affairs. . . . They are, after all, little more than [21]
              puppets at the mercy of a master manipulator. The real dramatic significance of their
              presentation, however, lies in the fact that each is presented with the adumbrations
              of a solution to his problem in the existence of his alter ego, and his inability to
              profit thereby is the result of powers as yet unrecognized, which blind him to the
              importance of the image in the glass.

          Champion (1970,
            p. 9): There is no significant development of the main characters; instead, they
              are manipulated into situations which are humorous as a result, for example, of
              mistaken identity or slapstick confusion. . . . The Antipholuses and
              Dromios . . . are . . . manipulated as they are amidst a confused wife, courtesan,
              kitchen wench, sea captain [sic], and goldsmith.

          Turner (1974,
            pp. 163, 177–82, 191–3), studying the plays to 1595, discusses how Sh. applies his
            rhetorical training to characterization, e.g., on holding our interest in a comic
            character by devising (p. 192) a composite character, a simple collection of
              attributes: We raise no question about an underlying character that
              would hold together all his [S. Antipholus’s] attributes because he gives no
              indication of a distinct inner life. . . . His plans and motives coincide with his
              behavior so that he suffers no inner conflict. . . . [S. Antipholus] loves
              Luciana . . . because he is a young man, and it is natural for young men to fall in
              love; his irritation with Dromio we know to be characteristic of masters; [193] his desire to hunt for a lost brother we attribute to his
              membership in the family. Yet the story leads us to make one tacit distinction among
              his attributes, separating the conditional from the unconditional. Antipholus’s
              irritation at Dromio is conditional upon their misunderstandings; his love for Luciana
              is an unconditional trait of being a young man; so too his desire for fulfillment
              within his family. . . . We assume that Adriana will become a patient, obedient wife
              once she has been instructed properly, that Luciana will love Antipholus once she
              learns that he is not her brother-in-law, and that Antipholus will not beat his
              servant once he learns the source of confusion. We assume that our standards of proper
              behavior are normal, so that some of Antipholus’s traits are temporary
              aberrations from the real and constant attributes of his
            class.

          Altman (1978,
            p. 166): For here is a play about two young men looking for their twin brothers
              who cannot recognize their traces when they see them; about a wife who preaches
              mutuality between lovers, yet jealously catechizes her husband in bed, at board,
              alone, and in company; a husband who lightly substitutes the companionship of a
              courtesan for that of his young wife; a spinster, fearful of the troubles of
                the marriage bed [301], who
              exhorts her sister to wifely obedience. All habitually think of themselves in relation
              to their fellows, but actually draw a narrow perimeter around themselves that prevents
              community. . . . Their errors, it would seem, are a metaphor for their essential
              egoism, and the plot is a function of their characters.

          Ornstein (1986,
            pp. 26–7): Most of the characters are mere sketches; some are ciphers of the plot
              and all must be hurried along from one perplexing event to the next lest they have
              time to reflect on the sudden irrationality and irresponsibility of those they have
              known for many years. If Antipholus E. had Viola’s [27]
              thoughtfulness he might like her guess that his twin has survived and is being
              mistaken for him, but that would undermine the plot. . . . Shakespeare shows
              considerable skill in making the responses of his characters seem plausible. Although
              Antipholus S. has come to Ephesus in search of his brother, he has little hope of
              finding him alive, for that would be as likely, he says, as for one drop of water to
                find his fellow forth [201] in the ocean. Therefore it does not occur to him that he receives
              strange courtesies from the Ephesians because he is being mistaken for his twin. He
              congratulates himself on his good luck and when that luck turns, he rails against
              these Ephesians, who have a reputation for engaging in witchcraft.

          Lanier (1994,
            p. 90): Errors stresses the marks and rituals—faces,
              clothing, beatings, warts and moles, meals, rings and gold chains—that make characters
              recognizable, and it demonstrates in copious variety how reliance upon this material
              evidence leads to unpredictable identity effects.

          Others who make general comments are Snider (1876, p. 297), who thinks all are stock characters:
              The individual when thus made purely the sport of external influences cannot
              show any of the deeper elements of character; Smeaton (1910, p. 93): In
              these minor characters Shakespeare showed that his hand had not yet acquired that
              freedom of outline-drawing and sureness of touch in portraiture, which afterwards were
              his so preeminently; Pettet (1949, p. 69): Another distinction between Err. and the other comedies is that apart from the possible
              exception of Luciana, all of them are elderly or mature men and women.

        





        
          Adriana

          Dowden (1877;
            1882, p. 67): Adriana, the jealous wife, has some individuality; she is more than
              an excuse for ridiculous accidents; Shakspere takes some interest in doing her
              dramatic justice; her shrewish temper is that of a woman who loves her husband, and
              who would persecute him into loving only her.

          Mackenzie
            (1924, pp. 25–6): As a figure of wronged wifehood she becomes almost tragically
              convincing, which very fact makes her, dramatically speaking, the most serious blemish
              on the play. Adultery has always been one of the stock jokes of the fabliau . . . and
              its inevitable concomitant is the perennial jest of the cornuto or his feminine equivalent. For Adriana to have been
              simply the typical jealous shrew would be quite in keeping with a story that is half
              Latin comedy and half Renaissance merry tale. Probably she was first
              conceived as that, for there is a good streak of the shrew in her. But then she
              suddenly steps out of the frame of farce: the conventional carpings with which she has
              been answering the conventional smugness of her sister, break into the bitter reality
              of [quotes 365–73].
              At her next appearance she is face to face with, as she thinks, her unfaithful
              husband, and there is not only truth but an incongruous passionate dignity in her
              remonstrances.

          Mackenzie (p.
            26) quotes most of 508–39, then: The underlying conception of marriage
              is one somewhat at variance with the Puritanic ideal in its full flower . . . where
              without loss of civil and ecclesiastical respectability, anyone may have as many
              partners as he can afford, subject only to the slight restraint of having them in
              succession instead of simultaneously.

          
            Whatever we may think of Adriana’s tact or wisdom in thus appealing to
              her husband’s reason, the speech has in it a curiously passionate apprehension of the
              deeper values of a recurrent situation. . . . It is real and tragic: and it has no
              business to be either, where it is. . . . Even Shakespeare had to learn his business
              like the rest of us.
          

          Charlton (1931;
            1938, pp. 68–9): Adriana is doubtless shrew, virago and vixen to boot. She breaks
              the servants’ pates across, though that hardly gives her characteristic distinction in
              a play in which fisticuffs are the regular means of intercourse. She rails at bed and
              board, and jealousy gives venom to her clamours, adding to them a virulence of which
              Plautus could scarcely avail himself, for it is only love in the modern sense
                which is full of jealousy. An English shrew, moreover, . . . is
              hampered by memories of the affection she once had for the man of her choice. Adriana
              even fondles at times. But her single lapse into the broken-hearted bride who will
              weep and die in tears is a fall both from type and from character. A more credibly
              humanizing trait appears in her excited enlargement of her husband’s frenzied acts:
              the duke is treated to a display of rumour’s growth, as facts swell with fancy when
              she recounts the incidents she thought she had seen ([1608] ff.). Yet at the end of the play, the shrew is not so
              much out of countenance as she was meant to be. . . . [69] The
              general temper of life depicted in The Comedy of Errors is so
              crude, coarse, and brutal, that Adriana’s fault appears to be not so much her
              shrewishness as her undiplomatic use of it. Even the abbess accuses her of nothing
              more heinous than bad tactics: —[quotes 1552–5].

          Elliott
            (1939–40, pp. 100–1): We cannot imagine Rosalind or Beatrice exclaiming
              to a servant, Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across [354]. But it is quite natural for their
              forerunner, Adriana, to speak thus to Dromio of Ephesus (line [354]). Her sister Luciana’s rebuke of her—Fie, how
                impatience loureth in your face! [362]—is histrionically revealing; such was the look that Shakespeare intended
              the boy-actor who created this part to employ continually. That look
              goes along with conduct, potentially at least, violent. And certainly the heroine of
              this drama has her full share in its mad doings. Yet louring impatience is merely on
              the surface of her; deep beneath is a devoted, yearning love for her
              husband. . . . 

          
            There is pathos, too, in her case, but the dramatist carefully
              subordinates it. When her sister urges her to be patient with her careless husband,
              Adriana exclaims [quotes 308–11]. True enough. But our sympathy with the speaker is overtopped by
              amusement at her mood of angry exaggeration. She is far from being a wretched
                soul bruised with adversity [308]. Her only real woe, here, is that her husband is very late for dinner. To
              be sure, she hints that he may be with another woman (line [304]). But this suspicion, entirely unfounded so far as the
              audience knows, is very faint and transient. All the more comical, therefore, is her
              great blaze of jealousy (lines [363] ff.)
              when the strange demeanour of Antipholus of Syracuse, mistaken for her husband, has
              been reported to her. At this juncture the device of mistaken identity is superbly
              used for comedy of character. Antipholus of Syracuse, unlike his jaunty brother, is
              gravely moral. When finally he enters Adriana’s presence and she regards him as
              Antipholus of Ephesus, he is exactly the man to look strange and frown
                ([505]). No wonder his bearing turns
              Adriana’s suspicion into a settled con­[101]viction. But
              now comes the finest stroke of all. Confronted with real trouble, . . . as she
              believes, in her husband’s life, her better nature comes to the fore. She drops her
              initial notion ([284]) that her own way of
              life should, by rights, be as free as her husband’s. She maintains indeed that there
              should be (in modern parlance) a single standard for both the sexes but she urges
              passionately that it should be pure and high [quotes 519–39]. How direct and powerful is
              the style here over against the neat, conventional rhetoric of the preceding
              quotation! This is one of the many instances . . . where Shakespeare’s good luck or
              good revision, or both, enables him to sharpen the style in accordance with the
              emotion. Here the pathos, by itself, would be too keen for comedy. But it is checked,
              for us, even as Adriana speaks, by the amazed looks of her two Syracusan listeners,
              wondering what it is all about; and it is submerged by the mirth, madder than ever,
              that ensues.
          

          Stevenson
            (1946, pp. 186–7): Adriana is concerned with the disparity between the
              worship she once received from Antipholus and her present lack of it. She is as
              unwilling to be pleased with Luciana’s outmoded ideas about the position of a woman as
              she is to resign herself to the unpleasantness of fact. She questions her own power to
              maintain her former exalted position [quotes 363–6]. [187] Not entirely in the
              farcical spirit of the rest of the play is her exclamation to [S. Antipholus] [quotes
                508–13]. Adriana
              remains baffled to the end.

          Craig (1948, p.
            24): Adriana has some of the qualities of the wronged and neglected
              wife, as indeed had Mulier in the Plautine original, but Adriana’s claims are
              recognized and respected; she is allowed to reform her conduct. Adriana is not
              unreasonable and has some individuality.

          Fergusson
            (1954, p. 28): There is one strand running through the whole Comedy of Errors which might seem, on a first reading, to break the mood of
              farce: the troubled adventures of Antipholus of Ephesus’ long-suffering wife. She is
              so disturbed when the other Antipholus treats her strangely that one might think
              Shakespeare wanted us to share her tears and frustrations. She and her sister and her
              maid, and eventually her real husband’s mistress, form a dreary female procession
              through the quick twists of the plot. But I believe that Shakespeare expected us to
              laugh at them also, and that, in performance, would be largely a matter of tempo. The
              film of a funeral, even, may be made laughable if it is run off at twice the proper
              speed, and if we saw the bewildered women running and dripping at the same time we
              should understand how they fit into the whole farcical scheme.

          For Brown
            (1957, p. 54) on Adriana’s possessive love, see .

          Tillyard (1958,
            p. 8): Adriana is a stupid woman, who fusses over her husband,
              while . . . Luciana is brighter and more worldly-wise.

          Brooks (1960,
            pp. 351–2) compares Err. and Shr.,
            Adriana and Kate, Luciana and Bianca. Neither shrew is completely shrewish: Adriana and Kate have just the wills we admire in Shakespeare’s finer
              heroines. . . . 

          
            Along with will goes intelligence. . . . Adriana’s intelligence is
              evident in her handling of her sister in their debate early in the play, when Luciana
              utters platitudes while Adriana states her case forcefully and convincingly; in her
              irresistible plea to the man she thinks her husband . . . ; and in her masterful
              argument to the Duke at the end. . . . [352] Their sisters,
              who show far less wit and imagination, are less valuable conquests.
          

          Tillyard (1965,
            pp. 58–60): It is not enough to dismiss Adriana as a jealous woman. The root of
              her trouble is stupidity, and lack of reflection and restraint that makes her her own
              worst enemy. She belongs to a higher rank in life than Mistress Quickly, but in her
              stupidity and garrulousness she is like her. She is also good-natured at bottom and
              quick to forgive. He gives examples of bad behavior, such as not paying
            attention to Luciana, striking Dromio in 2.1. (P. 59): She knows that stupidity
              is the root of the trouble. In the next scene . . . she cools rapidly [quotes 599–604]. Alas, her
              resolution not to be a fool does not hold, and she has to pay the price. There is
              pathos in her relations with her husband; for when it comes to the point he trusts
              her, and we never doubt that in all practical matters she was an excellent
              wife . . . [quotes 1091–4]. But the stupid woman will not see that her husband is duly [60] dependent on her and that she can afford to leave him alone.
              And so her creator sees to it that she is punished for her stupidity . . . [quotes
                1516–39].

          Muir (1972, p.
            47): We are never directly told whether Adriana’s jealousy has any real cause.
              Luciana, when she pleads with Antipholus, seems to assume that he is to blame, but
              expresses it as an hypothesis: If you like elsewhere [793]. She tells the Abbess he demeaned
                himself rough, rude, and wildly [1557]. But his wild behavior, as far as we see it in the play, is to have
              dinner, duly chaperoned, with a wench of
                excellent discourse, Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle. [770–1] He
              does this excusably after he has been shut out of his own house. The courtesan is
              remarkably unmercenary; she only asks for a gold chain promised her in exchange for a
              diamond ring worth forty ducats.

          Berry (1972,
            pp. 31–3): The relationship between Adriana and Antipholus of Ephesus,
              nominally a union, is in fact flawed; the two halves seek from the other what they do
              not find. . . . 

          I cannot follow the idea that the play is a tract on the evils of
              possessiveness in love [he quotes J. R. Brown, 1957, p. 54, above]. . . . Adriana’s view of
              love is scarcely central to the play, however one assesses it; and to denounce the
                possessiveness of Adriana seriously overstates the
              situation. . . . While Adriana is doubtless in the Roman tradition of the shrew, the
              contours are much softened. She is presented as an intelligent and independent woman
              fretting against an un­[32]reasonable social framework
              rather than one unreasonable in herself. Her scene with Luciana (II, 1) appears to
              place her in the Euripides-Shaw tradition of females who are in no way inclined to
              defer to the mores of a masculine society: Why should their liberty than ours
                be more ([284]) is the position
              she defends against the passive Luciana, all for deferring to the dominant male. The
              course of the play . . . suggests that this [i.e., 284] is essentially an argument
              that Adriana is making use of to justify her disquiet. She is, quite simply, terrified
              of losing her husband; to regain him, and not a proto-Fabian liberty of action, is her
              desire. . . . [Lines 1131–4 reveal] the truth of her anguish and fears. She does have
            cause for worry. (P. 33): Men who make a habit of visiting a courtesan, purely
              for the good food and high quality of conversation, must expect to have these
              blameless motives misinterpreted. The audience is put in the position of a divorce
              court judge, who unsurprisingly concludes on the evidence that both sides have a
              case.

          Bilton (1974,
            p. 43): Adriana’s jealousy is to provide a good deal of the play’s driving power:
              she needs to be active to get her husband back into the fold, and the gold chain, the
              courtezan, the merchant and Pinch are all involved.

          Schlösser
            (1977, p. 35) is uniquely insistent on the bad effect Adriana’s arranged marriage has on
            her feelings for Antipholus. He explains that Adriana is not just a nag, for the
            conditions of her marriage—which he later explains as that of a forced marriage of
            convenience—make her suffer conflicting emotions. For Schlösser on Antipholus’s
            negligent behavior as a husband, see .

          Hankins (1978,
            pp. 143–4) on Sh.’s use of humors theory: In Shakespeare’s first comedy, The Comedy of Errors, the well-balanced person is Luciana, who
              seeks to soothe the choleric temper of . . . Adriana. Adriana’s husband, . . . with
              his love of pleasure and his roving eye, seems to represent the sanguine temperament,
              while Antipholus of Syracuse is melancholy from his long and fruitless search for his
              mother and brother ([182–204]); the sudden onset of his love for Luciana is a rebound from
              melancholy. See also Hankins at n. 1537–55.

          Rees (1978, p.
            14): Adriana’s dependence on the love she fears she has lost makes an appeal for
              sympathy which runs across the bias of the play.

          Jardine (1983,
            pp. 44–6): All of this [shabby treatment from her husband and S. Antipholus’s
              wooing of Luciana] Adriana is obliged to participate in as a passive
                victim. At no point does she deliberately oppose her husband’s
              behaviour (and on several occasions she imputes it to her own shortcomings as a
              wife). For Jardine’s account of Adriana’s pleasure in recapturing her husband
            for renewed sexual relations, see n. 651–745 and .

          Ornstein (1986,
            pp. 29–30): For Adriana the marriage vow is like a tie of birth and
              blood in that her sense of self depends on her husband’s love and fidelity and she
              feels defiled by his adultery: [quotes 537–9]. These lines evoke the noblest Renaissance ideal
              of love—one soul in body twain—and do not allow us to dismiss Adriana’s complaints as
              shrewish jealousy. . . . 

          The lack of any scene in which Adriana directly confronts her erring
              husband is striking because her misery and insistence on the inequity of her situation
              give Errors much of its emotional ballast. Her
            complaints to Luciana and the abbess are not heard by her husband; perhaps Sh. was
            unwilling to risk making the other mistakes trivial by plumbing this discord.
              Although some critics have suggested that Adriana alienated her husband by a
              jealous possessiveness, she is not the eternally suspicious comic shrew that other
              dramatists portray. Her manner is never strident or undignified; her requests are
              never unreasonable. Balthazar, a voice of sanity in the play, speaks of her
                unviolated honor, of her wisdom. / Her sober virtue, years and
                modesty [749, 750–1]—hardly the attributes of a
              jealous nag. The worst that [30] Antipholus E. can say of her
              is that she is shrewish if he keeps not hours [620]—that is, if he is not home at a reasonable
              time.

          Ranald (1987,
            pp. 114–15): Throughout the entire play Adriana is continually given an emotional
              dimension beyond that of the traditional shrew, the one-dimensional figure of farcical
              fun who needs to be beaten into submission, producing a conflict of tone
            between horseplay and matrimonial subplot that looks ahead to later plays.
              Luciana, despite her apparent gentle pliability, also comes across as
              distinctly coldblooded in her suggestion to Antipholus of Syracuse (mistaken for his
              brother) that he dissemble, appear to love Adriana while seeking enjoyment elsewhere.
              She apparently accepts the double standard . . . : [quotes 791–810]. . . . [115] This code of behavior leaves a nasty taste with the audience; the
              mettlesome wife has a legitimate complaint, and with feminine friends such as Luciana
              an enemy is superfluous.

          Candido (1990,
            p. 225): When viewed in this context of her husband’s socially theatening
            tardiness for dinner Adriana’s behavior assumes a deeper and more richly
              suggestive character than the mere ragings of a jealous housewife. Her determination
              to refrain from eating despite the fact that her husband is two hours late ([277]) indicates a serious attempt to maintain
              personal equilibrium and social bonds in the face of heavy pressure. Adriana is no
              mere jealous shrew (her readiness to forgive later in the play is too often slighted);
              rather she is a fiercely combative woman confronting squarely the threat of an
              imperiled marriage and determined to sustain meaningful ties despite social and
              personal threats to her identity as wife and Lady.

          Others who comment on Adriana are Claus (1861, pp. 30–5), who is sympathetic to her complaints
            about her husband; O’Brien (1878, p. 160), who thinks Adriana is a shrew but a person of
            consequence since the Duke arranged the marriage; Oechelhäuser (1885, p. 245), who
            can see in her none of the lovable characteristics of the fair sex; Lewes (1895, p. 126): Such a
              woman, be she never so fair and charming, is not fitted to chain a man to the domestic
              hearth. . . . She turns his home into a hell by her cross and peevish
              jealousy; Smeaton (1910, p. 91): Despite all the sweetness of her nature,
              [she] degrades her womanhood by suspicion; Gaehde (1931, p. 93): Her response
            to Aemilia’s catechism in Act 5 strengthens her femininity so we believe she will change
            her shrewishness; Davies (1939, pp. 44–5); Pettet (1949, p. 68): Adriana, less harsh and
              a shade more sympathetic to us than her counterpart in the Menaechmi, is still substantially a stock classical character—the
              shrew; Phialas (1966, p. 11), who notes Adriana’s startlingly romantic
              passage, 505–15, opposing Fergusson’s comedy above; Lloyd Evans (1969, p. 93): She is a
              dutiful wife capable . . . of jealousy, but preserving an anxious and, at
              times, tearful fidelity to the end; Dias (1977, p. 51), who finds Adriana’s
              voice . . . hard, harsh, screeching, and high-pitched, without giving
            evidence; he doesn’t like her; Shintri (1977, p. 181): Adriana is an unhappy woman,
              wronged by her husband and misunderstood by others. . . . [She] is a rich woman who
              has loved and married the wrong person; Cook (1980, p. 26): She is a scold
            and certainly jealous, but perhaps with cause; Pitt (1981, pp. 77–80).

        





        
          Æmilia

          The spelling of her name is that adopted by the commentator.

          Bradi (ca.
            1900, pp. 61–3): A sentimental portrait of Emilia—her piercing eye reads the human
            heart; she’s a faithful wife, a tender mother. Bradi imagines a life for her,
            celebrating the virtues of the nunnery.

          Tillyard (1965,
            p. 57): Aemilia, a symbol of severe and stately authority, but again hardly
              characterized, serves the play substantially. Her unexpected appearance (and we can
              picture her as tall and commanding, and conspicuous in her black habit among the
              excited particoloured folk that throng the stage) is one of the great moments of the
              play; an abrupt check to the wild fantasy that has been accumulating through the
              previous acts and a sign that the resolution is at hand. . . . Yet, though thus an
              agent of normal human action, she is hardly humanized herself.

          Leggatt (1974,
            pp. 16–17): In the last scene the Abbess, not the Duke, is the real figure of
              authority, remaining calm and clear-headed while he struggles to make sense of the
              matter. She alone registers no surprise, accepting the strange events as easily as if
              she had expected them to happen all along. And she presides over the final feast,
              suggesting in her invitation that what has taken place is a new birth—thus linking the
              miracle of the ending with the normal processes of life: [quotes 1890–6]. [17]
              As the Abbess takes centre stage away from the Duke, so the fussy legalism he has
              represented is swept away by a deeper authority, the spontaneous force of
              life.

          Huston (1981,
            pp. 16–17): The characters try to bring order out of chaos that develops during
              the fifth act, but they meet only with more confusion. When they appeal to the
              representative of the [17] Church for help, the Abbess tricks
              the woman who addresses her, supplies an explanation that immensely oversimplifies the
              problem at hand, and then retreats with material witnesses into the secluded and
              detached realm of the priory.

          Ornstein (1986,
            pp. 32–3): In Act 5 the muddle demands an arbiter with the fey humor and
              shrewd insight of the Abbess, who commands attention by force of personality as well
              as her religious office. Even before she knew that Antipholus was her son, she
              protected him against his pursuers, and she is unwilling to surrender him until she
              has cured his seeming distraction. With a woman’s instinct for the practical she
              questions Adriana about the origins of her husband’s bizarre
            behavior. . . . 

          
            The comedy of the Abbess’s examination of Adriana is directed as much
              against her role as sage counselor as it is against Adriana, for she has a knack for
              clothing outrageous exaggerations in ancient saws: [quotes 1546–51]. [33]
              By the time she has finished her explanation, Adriana’s household has become a scene
              out of Hieronymus Bosch, and Luciana protests the distortion. The Abbess, one
              suspects, has not spent all her life inside the walls of a convent. She knows
              something of men, women, and marriage, and her brisk confident manner is a happy
              contrast to the helplessness that is expressed in the speeches of Adriana and Luciana.
              One doubts that she ever viewed Egeon as her lord and master.
          

          
          Kehler (1991,
            pp. 157–61), comparing Aemilia and Paulina in WT: Both
              women believe themselves to be widows yet lack certainty. Remarriage, were they so
              inclined, is precluded. Shipwrecked Aemilia, who must find a means of subsistence,
              turns to the Church and serves Christ. . . . In both plays, celibate women undertake
              successful independent action, partly enforcing, partly subverting, patriarchal
              values.

          Egeon, in giving in to Aemilia’s desire to return home, reenacts Adam’s uxoriousness,
            and Aemilia shares Eve’s painful childbirth and loses everything. (P. 159): Her situation contrasts sharply with her husband’s: Egeon has not entered the
              religious life. One reason, of course, is his responsibil­[160]ity for raising [his son and Dromio]. An equally important reason,
              however, is that religious withdrawal is not a male response to catastrophe in
              Shakespeare: men do not require protection. In the secular world, the male privilege
              of sexual freedom would not have been denied Egeon. . . . Aemilia, to gain the
              protection of the Church, must commit sexual suttee. Her thirty-three years of
              celibacy might be regarded as a patriarchally imposed expiation for
              sexuality. . . . 

          
            Nevertheless, first having freely relinquished sexual power over men,
              then having yielded all to time’s deformed hand ([1779]), the Aemilia of Act V is a figure of authority.
              Celibacy has enabled her to achieve power within the Church hierarchy. . . . Nor does
              the text suggest an end to Aemilia’s celibacy. Aemilia’s concluding speech abounds in
              Christian references that emphasize her former religious identity rather than a new or
              resumed secular one. . . . A defrocked Aemilia remains outside the play, difficult to
              imagine. Even an Aemilia who leaves her office to live with Egeon, ruling her
              household and extended family as she had the abbey, is more easily envisaged as a
              celibate—affectionately a wife, sexually a widow. . . . 
          

          [161] Aemilia rejects sexuality, ensuring her
              fidelity to her lost husband as she serves another Father, another Son, sublimating
              desire through love of a male-engendered God. . . . 

          [Her] importance is increased as she is moved from the utmost margins
              of the play . . . to a prominent place in its conclusion. She becomes a major
            agent in the plot by holding back the Syracusans, she reproves Adriana and so restores
            domestic order, and she appropriates the Duke’s authority with her long speech.
              Thus as Aemilia suddenly becomes a major character, her actions and authority
              interrogate the doctrine Luciana had expounded in II.i maintaining women’s lower place
              in the world order. . . . Neither wife nor widow, celibate Aemilia is herself an
              error, confounding gender roles and locating an inadequacy in the hierarchizing of the
              social formation, as she bridges and breaches categories, successfully, irreducibly
                there.
          

          Wolfensperger
            (1994, pp. 71–2) points to conflicting attitudes toward the Abbess and accounts for them
            as the result of Shn. intentional manipulation. On the one hand her prestige and
            authority are insisted on by making her an Abbess, the head of a priory, and one who
            cures people. But she is undermined too: Not unlike Luciana in the débat scene [2.2] the Abbess repeatedly
              resorts to proverbs and proverbial phrases, whose hollowness . . . undermines her
              conjugal counsel as noted by Ornstein. The Abbess reveals herself to be
              an authoritarian rather than an authoritative adviser. Note that both her first and
              last utterances are orders (ll. [1505] and
                [1581]). And her walking out on Adriana
              (l. [1581]) . . . can hardly be said to
              tally with her role as a mediatrix. . . . 

          
            [Her] authority is perhaps most decisively undermined by a crowning
              irony that has escaped critical attention: How can she possibly bring Adriana’s
              husband to his wits and make of him a formal man again, if she is housing the Syracusian Antipholus? By taking in the wrong Antipholus, she,
              too, is taken in. The Abbess, too, becomes a victim of discrepant awareness; she is
              not allowed either to dispose of the (whole) truth needed for her remedial endeavours
              to be successful. . . . 
          

          [72] [Her] status is restored in her second
              appearance.

          But we must remember that she is not responsible for a deliberate, careful plan that
            brings about the solution to the errors. It is as if Shakespeare is using her as
              a kind of last minute expedient designed to bring the comedy to a close, but at the
              same time denying her the full-hearted support he usually gives to his frame
              figures.

          Others who comment on Æmilia are Smeaton (1910, p. 92): As the Abbess she appears
              rather too positive and peremptory to be pleasant, but her last speech . . . savours
              of the milk of human kindness and (Matheson (1932, p. 69): She is dignified and
              kind, and joyous . . . at the reunion with her sons and husband.

        





        
          E. Antipholus

          Knight (ed.
            1842, pp. 206–7): Antipholus of Ephesus is decidedly inferior to his brother in
              the quality of his intellect and the tone of his morals. He is scarcely justified in
              calling his wife shrewish [620]. . . . [He] has somewhat hard measure dealt to him throughout the
              progress of the Errors; —but he deserves it. His doors are shut against him, it is
              true; —in his impatience he would force his way into his house, against the
              remonstrances of the good Balthazar: —[quotes 750–2]. He departs, but not in patience
                [755]; —he is content to dine from home,
              but not at the Tiger [756].
              His resolve— That chain will I bestow
                  (Be it for nothing but to spite my wife) Upon mine hostess [778–80]—
              would not have been made by his brother in a similar situation. He has spited his
              wife; he has dined with the courtesan. But he is not satisfied: —[quotes 997–9]. We pity him not
              when he is arrested, nor when he receives the [207]
                rope’s end instead of his ducats [1297, 1294].
              His furious passion with his wife, and the foul names he bestows on her, are quite in
              character; and when he has Beaten the maids a-row, and
                  bound the doctor, [1643] we cannot have a suspicion that the doctor was practising on
              the wrong patient. In a word, we cannot doubt that, although the Antipholus of Ephesus
              may be a brave soldier, who took deep scars [1669] to save his prince’s life, —and that he really has a
              right to consider himself much injured, —he is strikingly opposed to the Antipholus of
              Syracuse; that he is neither sedate, nor gentle, nor truly-loving; —that he has no
              habits of self-command; —that his temperament is sensual; —and that, although the
              riddle of the perplexity is solved, he will still find causes of unhappiness, and
              entertain a huge infectious troop
                  Of pale distemperatures [1550–1].

          O’Brien (1878,
            p. 161): He calmly settles himself down at Ephesus and troubles himself no more
              about the matter of his lost family; O’Brien apparently supposes that he has
            some information about that family. It is no wonder that he is exasperated; yet
              his whole tone is coarser and more violent than his brother’s; and indeed he is not at
              all an engaging personage in himself, though his storms of rage and his ineffectual
              struggles to get into his own house doubtless heighten the fun of the
            play.

          Craig (1948, p.
            23): E. Antipholus is a self-willed, rather dissolute man, not, however, to a
              point where his standing as a citizen of Ephesus is imperiled. His commercial credit
              is good, and he has been a valiant soldier in the service of the Duke. . . . [He] is
              in general a lively character.

          Tillyard (1965,
            p. 56): E. Antipholus is the more energetic, the more practical, the more
              choleric; the younger Antipholus is in comparison melancholy, sensitive, and of a
              livelier imagination. He gives examples, from E. Antipholus’s proposing to
            break into his house to S. Antipholus’s pessimism about finding his brother and being
            slow to figure out why people greet him.

          Berry (1972, p.
            30): In the play’s design he is the temperamental complement of his brother; his
              explanation of a disordered world is that the others are mad or leagued in conspiracy
              against him. The proud, self-sufficient man of property, bound in a dark room, is a
              note whose significance in Shakespeare’s future no one fails to recognize, but it is
              allowed to develop no overtones here.

          
          Schlösser
            (1977, pp. 33–5): Antipholus is no model husband who—as Eph.
              5:33 says—should love his wife as he loves himself.

          (P. 34): It has often been explained that his visit to the Porcupine is a spontaneous
            reaction to being locked out of his own house. That explains it indeed, but whether
            sufficiently or not remains a question. He is not simply an affronted husband who
            wanders aimlessly through the streets and finally finds consolation with a
            courtesan. . . . Our Antipholus knows the maiden and describes her from his own
            experience [quotes 770–1]—doubtless a pleasant partner, unlike Adriana (possibly because she
            wasn’t forced to marry), but she is still an anonymous courtesan whom one can buy for
            money. To annoy his wife the rich citizen Antipholus will give the Courtesan a gift. The
            gold chain that he meant to give to his wife to appease her and make up for his neglect,
            is now supposed to buy free love. Since later on his Syracusan brother
            gets the chain, he takes the Courtesan’s ring he had
              at dinner
            perforce ([1251, 1277]). [Schlösser seems to believe the
            Courtesan’s fiction, 1275–9.] The ring symbolizes rather straightforwardly the kind of good
              cheer ([1881–2]) he enjoyed with her; this relationship is not just platonic. His
            parenthetical assertion that Adriana suspects him without reason ([773]) is simply intended not to give himself away in front of
            his acquaintances (and possibly before certain parts of the audience). Reputation is
            important to an honorable citizen; his credit is based on it; he doesn’t dare, as
            Balthazar warns him . . . , to expose himself to vulgar comment ([761]), and he will try to cover up his affairs
            (Ger.). [Schlösser is alone in his cynicism.]

          At home he need not be so careful. As Luciana’s plea to the wrong brother shows, he
            doesn’t even try [35] to act the loving
            husband. Her all too Solomonic advice to have his affair conducted secretly and to play
            the loyal husband ([801]) is no recipe for
            an ideal marriage, but it explicitly refers to a marriage for money where convenience is
            substituted for feeling. But even this is foreign to Adriana’s husband. He wants to
              tame the shrew as well as the servants with a rope’s end ([998]). This would not be a capital crime in the
            British tradition of burlesque; but it is, along with the endless beatings, a drastic
            signal of the loss of human bonds; and it serves this Antipholus right when he is
            mistakenly arrested for debt and declared crazy by a psychiatric expert [sic] Dr. Pinch
            and is then tied up and led away (Ger.).
          

          Altman (1978,
            pp. 168–9): Although different in personality from his more romantic brother—a
              soldier and a man about town—he is like him in his solitude of spirit. This is
              suggested not only in the neglect of his wife, but in the little debate he conducts
              with his guest Balthazar on the respective merits of food and conviviality [quotes
                638–50]. . . . [He] tends to be materialistic [169] and
              lacking in charity. This is amplified a few moments later when, enraged by his wife’s
              innocent refusal to let him in . . . he threatens to break down the door with a
              crowbar until Balthazar persuades him that to do so might permanently damage his
              reputation. . . . [Rather than patiently bide his time by dining at the Tiger,] he
              invites his guests to the Porpentine, where the courtesan resides, and presents her
              with the golden chain intended for Adriana. He is a petty and legalistic man, who sees
              a wife merely as a mindless instrument of his own comfort.

          Ornstein (1986,
            p. 30): Antipholus [E.] seems ignorant of his wife’s unhappiness and is guilty,
              so it seems, of insensitivity rather than habitual infidelity. He is obtuse and
              quick-tempered, ready to engage in a flyting match with his servants or to tear down
              the gate to his house with a crowbar, but he is not loutish. . . . [His description
              of the courtesan is a] circumspect description [that] does not come from the lips of a
              libertine; Antipholus E. is a successful businessman who uses his wife’s mistreatment
              of him as an excuse for a night on the town. Because he is too coarse-grained and
              attached to his comforts to spend years in search of a lost brother, one doubts that
              he would understand Adriana’s ideal of marriage even if he heard her pleas.
            Ornstein seems to suppose E. Antipholus knows of his brother.

          Candido (1990,
            p. 225): Clearly Antipholus of Ephesus’s failure to come to dinner on time is a
              repudiation of more than mere food; his absence from home is the first step in the
              flouting of an accepted social ceremony that helps define his identity as respected
              citizen and respectful husband. . . . Reputation and marriage begin to dissolve
              together when the wrong brother dines at home.

          Others who comment on E. Antipholus are Stapfer (1880, pp. 151–2): He is cast in a commoner
              mould; he is not, however, devoid of all sense of delicacy and honour; we
            believe his word that he is innocent of what Adriana reproaches him with; Burelbach (1968, p.
            72): Choleric, business-like—he mistakenly says this of S.
            Antipholus.

        





        
          S. Antipholus

          Bräker (1780;
            tr. 1979, p. 51): Dear maker of men [God, not Sh.], why do you make those
              otherwise kind gentlemen such avid floggers?

          Knight (ed.
            1842, pp. 205–6): But the wandering Antipholus . . . is a prey to care
                and melancholy [183]. He has a
              holy purpose to execute, which he has for years pursued without success: —[quotes 197–200]. Sedate,
              gentle, loving, the Antipholus of Syracuse is one of Shakspere’s amiable creations. He
              beats his slave according to the custom of slave-beating; but he laughs with him and
              is kind to him almost at the same moment. He is an enthusiast, for he falls in love
              with Luciana in the midst of his perplexities, and his lips utter some of the most
              exquisite poetry: —[quotes 832–6]. But he is accustomed to habits of self-command, and he resolves to
              tear himself away even from the syren: —[quotes 953–4]. As his perplexities increase, he ceases to be
              angry with his slave: —[206] [quotes 1224–6]. Unlike the Menæchmus
              Sosicles of Plautus, he refuses to dine with the courtesan. He is firm yet courageous
              when assaulted by the Merchant. When the Errors are clearing up, he modestly adverts
              to his love for Luciana; and we feel that he will be happy.

          O’Brien (1878,
            p. 161): S. Antipholus is the better man of the two, not content until he has
              searched the world for his missing relations. . . . That [he] takes the bewildering
              course of events at Ephesus more quietly than his twin, is not surprising, as things
              are much pleasanter for him. . . . [He] is of a quieter nature, and bends to the
              pressure of circumstances. . . . [He] seems a more refined and poetical man.
            O’Brien appears to think that E. Antipholus knows that he has a twin but has never
            sought him, making his brother the better man.

          Elliott
            (1939–40, p. 100): Antipholus of Syracuse, unlike his jaunty brother, is gravely
              moral. When finally he enters Adriana’s presence and she regards him as Antipholus of
              Ephesus, he is exactly the man to look strange and frown ([505]).

          Craig (1948, p.
            24): S. Antipholus is an experienced traveller, curious about foreign lands,
              properly wary of the ways of strange peoples, a well-disposed man, capable of true
              love and honest sentiment.

          Berry (1972, p.
            28): S. Antipholus is a melancholy fellow, embryo to Hamlet.

          Ornstein (1986,
            p. 30): Antipholus S. is a more interesting character. . . . Like many later
              romantic heroes he is a rapturous wooer, one who has read many sonnets and knows by
              heart the literary language of love, the appropriate conceits and hyperboles with
              which to declare a boundless passion. He protests that Luciana is our earth’s
                wonder, more than earth divine [819]; nay, she is a very deity. Like many later heroines Luciana seems wiser
              than the man who woos her, even though she seems at first priggish in advising her
              sister to accept her unhappy lot without complaint.

          Others who comment on S. Antipholus include Horn (1827, 4:267): He is presented initially as
            tenderly wistful, but vulgarly jokes about Nell, bad taste on Sh.’s part; Stapfer (1880, p.
            130): His is a more delicate nature [with] a tinge of melancholy and
              reverie; Burelbach (1968, p. 72): He is melancholic and
              imaginative—Burelbach mistakenly reverses the two brothers, saying this of E.
            Antipholus.

          Others who describe both Antipholuses are Oechelhäuser (1885, pp. 238, 241, 242): Both are
            violent and excitable, marked by the beatings they give; (p. 241) E. Antipholus has to
            mimic affection for Adriana in Act 5 since he is given no words, and (p. 242), they get
            no words to mark their reunion; Richter (1930, p. 19): S. Antipholus, under the watchful eye
            of his father, is better raised and more talented; Sen Gupta (1950, p. 107): They are
              much more refined than their Plautine counterparts, but not
            individualized any more than the Dromios.

        





        
          Courtesan

          Gill (1924, p.
            91): Despite E. Antipholus’s disclaimer (770–1), in her two very brief appearances we see in
              her . . . only the desire for profit. She is determined to have the chain, or at
              least her ring. When Antipholus of Syracuse’s denial that he has the ring is added to
              Antipholus of Ephesus’ wild story of being shut out of his own house, she is the first
              to diagnose his case as lunacy. She goes to Adriana with her carefully edited story
              and easily convinces Adriana that her husband is mad.

          Davies (1939,
            p. 45): She is a mere puppet. . . . He never draws another courtesan who is not
              well characterized.

          For Pettet’s
            (1949) remarks on her mercenary sense, see .

          Vaughn (1980,
            p. 18): She is never called courtesan on stage; To the audience,
              she is simply a pretty hostess. That, of course, depends on how she is
            played.

        





        
          The Dromios

          Knight (ed.
            1842, pp. 207–8): The two Dromios have fewer differentiating qualities than their
            masters. But there is certainly a marked difference in the quality of their
              mirth. [E. Dromio] is precise and antithetical, striving to utter his jests with
              infinite gravity and discretion, and approaching a pun with a sly solemnity that is
              prodigiously diverting: —[quotes 209–12, 247–9]. He is a formal humorist, and, we have no doubt,
              spoke with a drawling and monotonous accent, fit for his part in such a dialogue as
              this: —[quotes 1355–62]. On the contrary, the merry jests [184] of Dromio of Syracuse all come from the outpouring of
              his gladsome heart. He is a creature of prodigious animal spirits, running over with
              fun and queer similitudes. [208] He makes not the slightest
              attempt at arranging a joke, but utters what comes uppermost with irrepressible
              volubility. He is an untutored wit; and we have no doubt gave his tongue such active
              exercise, by hurried pronunciation and variable emphasis, as could alone make his long
              description endurable by his sensitive master . . . [refers to 430–503, 870–936, 1141–9]. These distinctions between
              the Antipholuses and Dromios have not, as far as we know, been before pointed out;
              —but they certainly do exist, and appear to us to be defined by the great master of
              character with singular force as well as delicacy.

          Craig (1948, p.
            24): The Dromios . . . have at least some marks of difference. . . . The more
              staid and responsible traveller is given the more jocular and impudent Dromio, a sort
              of all-licensed fool, who apparently is flogged and expects to be flogged rather
              frequently. The more lively of the masters is given a rather more serious, protesting,
              bewildered slave.

          Others who comment on the Dromios are O’Brien (1878, p. 162): A laughable picture of the
              two honest fellows, so faithful and so quaint, taking the merry side of everything,
              even of the blows; Oechelhäuser (1885, p. 243) finds a mixture of booby and joker, droll
            rogues with a sufficient portion of worldly savvy; Eckhardt (1902, p. 410) considers
            S. Dromio the wittier of the two; Richter (1930, p. 10) thinks S. Dromio is subtler,
            sprightlier and that E. Dromio is duller, moved only by blows; Sen Gupta (1950, p. 107): They are
              neither Roman slaves nor Elizabethan fools; they are marionettes; Smith (1978, pp.
            166–203) tries to show how the Dromios matched the particular actors of the
            Chamberlain’s men in 1594.

        





        
          Egeon

          Porter &amp;
                Clarke (ed. 1903, p. xxiv): The dry little
              argument preceding Plautus’s play, in which the bare facts leading to the subsequent
              action are set forth, and in which the one pathetic touch is the father’s death
              because of the loss of his child, has been developed in the story of Ægeon into a
              serious and wonderfully pathetic background. . . . Not only is the family interest
              enlarged by bringing the father into the play at the beginning and representing him as
              separated by cruel circumstances from all his family—wife as well as sons, —but, by
              placing him in a situation where he is accused of breaking the laws of the city, he is
              brought into contact with the government, and thus a wider social environment is
              opened out for the play.

          Tillyard (1965,
            p. 57): The parents . . . are hardly characterized at all. Aegeon is little more
              than a humour of aged melancholy; rightly, because, if fully animated, he would have
              introduced an element of tragedy that the farcical core could not have
              sustained.

          Altman (1978,
            pp. 170–1): No one in the play ever seriously doubts his own
              presuppositions. . . . And when Aegeon himself, that dedicated [171] searcher of sons, finally confronts the Antipholus who never saw him and
              therefore cannot possibly recognize him, does he consider that this might be the son
              he lost as an infant? He does not. His response is totally egoistic.

          Others who comment on Egeon: Gaehde (1931, p. 93) notes the deep knowledge of the human heart in
            Egeon’s lament when his son does not recognize him in Act 5; Purdom (1963, p. 78) thinks that as
            the protagonist he is weak because he appears in only two scenes; we can sympathize with
            him but hardly admire him, a further weakness in Err.

        





        
          Luciana

          Clarke (1873,
            pp. 525–6): Luciana . . . is a domestic philosopher. She has conned
              lessons of connubial discretion in an excellent school—the house of her married
              sister, Adriana. She has learned forbearance from observing the other’s intolerance;
              she has acquired the art of making allowance, from noting her sister’s exacting
              impatience; she grows confirmed in smooth acquiescence, from seeing the folly as well
              as misery of irritable and irritating opposition. . . . While Adriana frets and
              fumes, Luciana gathers composure and a philosophy of obedience. Their first colloquy
              shows this characteristically: the one all heat and anger, the other all coolness and
              propriety. Shakespeare . . . has made Luciana . . . such a woman as would make one
              of those wives considered by common-minded men as model wives; that is,
              obedient and fawning wives. Luciana is calculating, submissive, and shrewdly obedient.
              She is ultra-passive outwardly, while inwardly maintaining a perfectly self-satisfied
              independence of opinion. Moreover, like all those women of systematic yieldingness
              rather than rational yieldingness, Luciana is given to palter with truth. It
              follows . . . that a woman who makes to herself a law, a mere calculating law, of
              blind and prone submission as the best course for her own interest, inevitably
              becomes, if not a liar, yet an equivocator, a sophisticator, a prevaricator, in some
              way a deviator from straightforward truth. All the little shifts and evasions; the
              paltry tricks and petty artifices; the carnying deceptions; the amiable falsifyings
              which women who adopt implicit obedience as their stock in trade in
              wedlock allow themselves, are the necessary growth of the course they pursue. Artful
              speech [526] and conduct are sure to proceed from forced and
              unnatural compliance; and uniform compliance is unnatural. . . . [Quotes 791–801.]

          
            Luciana is a specimen of a prudent, judicious girl, who has a calm eye
              to her own comfortable welfare; who makes the failings and miseries of her friends
              beacons to herself . . . ; who coolly reasons on her sister’s agonies of jealousy and
              remonstrance, drawing sedate lessons therefrom . . . ; who quietly marks the marital
              despotisms of her brother-in-law, that she may know how to manage those of a future
              husband herself; and who, from her collected philosophy of serene observation, will
              learn to win a lover, to make a good match, and to rule her lord and master—all under
              the guise of being the meekest, the sweetest, the softest, and the most undesigning of
              her sex. There are many Lucianas in the world. Heaven forbid that one of them should
              fall to the lot of any male friend of mine for a wife.
          

          Gill (1924, p.
            92): Luciana is a young woman with few illusions as to man’s place in
              the world, and she is perhaps a trifle cynical. She is cool where Adriana is all
              impatience, and, finding excuses for the absent brother-in-law, she gives Adriana a
              dissertation on the masterful nature of the male and on self-harming
                jealousy [378]. . . . 

          
            She finds something engaging in Antipholus’ love-making, even though she
              cannot understand him, for she tells her sister that his words in an honest suit might
              move her.
          

          Charlton (1931;
            1938, pp. 69–71): Luciana . . . breaks in on the abbess’s reproaches [quotes
                1556–8]. The
              challenge is exactly what the woman of to-day would urge. Yet in the rest of the play,
              though it is our sentimental sympathy with Luciana which has reflected on Adriana a
              deeper condemnation than has any of the formal charges laid against her, our sympathy
              with Luciana is not in the least founded on a concurrence in her explicit propositions
              about the relationship of man and wife. It is indeed Adriana who speaks with the voice
              of to-day in these matters. Why should man’s liberty than our’s be
                more? [284, slightly misquoted] she asks her sister, adding that none but
              asses will be bridled in such fashion by their husbands’ will. But this is Luciana’s
              creed: —[quotes 290–9] [70]. No mortal in this world of ours now would
              venture to swear by such a creed: nor could a subject of Queen Elizabeth have easily
              dared to do so. And yet though Luciana’s terms are mere relics of the past, she
              secures from the moderns more instinctive sympathy than does her sister, despite the
              almost Georgian modernity of Adriana’s views on conjugal equality. For Luciana brings
              into the play a range of sentiment utterly incompatible with the atmosphere of this
                Comedy of Errors. When Antipholus of Syracuse woos her as
              [quotes 850–3] he is
              putting into words a way of looking on the relationship of man and woman different
              fundamentally from the point of view expressed in Roman comedy and its English
              imitations. He summarizes the rise of romance, medieval romance embedded in
            the 16th c., and even when Sh. is recoiling from romance, he could not divest
              himself of the romantic. . . . Luciana is a singing mermaid, [71] spreading o’er the silver waves the echoes of her song and wisps of golden
              hair as a bed whereon her love may lie. Not even Shakespeare can make sisters of two
              such beings. They are of different family, and indeed of different race, if not of
              different species.

          Craig (1948, p.
            24): Luciana is a responsible young woman and has more sense than does Bianca in
                [Shr.]. She deserves the good husband she gets in
              Antipholus of Syracuse.

          Tillyard (1965,
            pp. 61–2): The critics have gone wrong over Luciana even more than over Adriana,
              and with less excuse. . . . Luciana is essentially resolute in character. And as for
                lyrical and romantic, these epithets
              are quite alien to this shrewd and practical young woman. . . . Nothing could be less
              romantic than her advice to Antipholus of Syracuse. . . . It is pure worldly wisdom,
              tempered by a loyal solicitude for her sister’s happiness. [Quotes 791–4, 803–6, 810–14.] [62]
              Unlike her blundering sister, Luciana is observant. In her loyalty she tells Adriana
              of Antipholus’s advances (IV, ii). Though shocked with their impropriety, she takes
              note of their nature and admits that, addressed to the proper person, they would be in
              very good style. In another place her observant nature is conveyed with a subtlety
              that few readers would expect of Shakespeare in so early a play. In II, ii, Adriana
              and Luciana, mistaking one Antipholus for the other, try to persuade Antipholus of
              Syracuse to enter the house and eat the long-postponed dinner. Utterly bewildered, he
              allowed himself to be persuaded and tells us so in an aside. Whereupon, Luciana cries
              out, Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner [582]. She has heard nothing, but she has been watching
              Antipholus’s face and sees that he has changed his former mind.

          Barton (in Evans, ed. 1974, p.
            81): Like Egeon, Luciana is a character for whom there is no analogue in Plautus.
              The voice of reason and tolerance in the play, sane in the midst of madness, she
              counters the possessiveness and jealous frenzy of her sister Adriana with counsels of
              generosity and patience. Her own ideal of marriage is . . . a relationship of mutual
              trust in which the woman is frankly subservient to her husband, as St. Paul believed
              she should be, but finds her own liberty and independence within this circumscription.
              It does not seem to be an ideal which Luciana has had much opportunity to see in
              practice. Faced with a nagging and suspicious sister and a brother-in-law who is
              careless of his wife’s feelings and quick to anger . . . Luciana has remained
              single, though it is assumed she will marry S. Antipholus.

          Bilton (1974,
            p. 43): Luciana’s lines [290–9] win her sympathy in relation to her would-be
              emancipated sister and so prepare the emotional ground for the rebuke Adriana receives
              from the Abbess at the end of the play, when marital relationships become the centre
              of attention.

          Haines (1978,
            pp. 110–13) thinks Luciana’s Not this, but troubles of the marriage
              bed (301) is
              puzzling . . . mysterious, wondering if she speaks from experience as
            a widow, or whether as a decent virgin, [she is] slightly apprehensive about the
              marriage bed. About 22 of her 43 speeches are about adultery, and this
              line might be read simply as one more, oblique, allusion to her favourite
              subject. S. Antipholus’s offer in Act 5 is tepid and she [111] responds nothing, so we don’t know if they will marry.

          
            Yet Luciana must be strongly inclined . . . to accept Syracuse
              Antipholus’s offer of marriage. She seems to have very quickly become infatuated with
              him. [fn.: If it is accepted that Luciana is infatuated, there is no way of knowing
              how long she has been so before the start of the play. It is worth
              suggesting . . . that perhaps Luciana suddenly feels for Syr. Ant., while thinking
              him Eph. Ant., an affection she had not felt for the real Eph. Ant.; that is, she
              entirely unconsciously knows that Syr. Ant. is not Eph. Ant.] Only infatuation may
              satisfactorily explain the direction of some of her Act III words to Antipholus and
              her Act IV revelations to her sister. Without even infatuation to act as a partial
              justification, Luciana must appear a thoroughly Machiavellian young
              lady, participating quite by accident in a farce.
          

          
            Some of Luciana’s lines . . . could be supposed spoken by Lady Macbeth
              herself: [quotes 786–814]. It is not only the colour of Luciana’s words that is
              dark . . . [but they are] cynical in the extreme. . . . 
          

          [112] This whole unsavoury episode is
              complicated rather than simplified by what is revealed at the opening of IV,ii.
              Luciana there reveals her brother-in-law’s proposals to his sister. For her then to
              report to Adriana, with some show of anguish and displeasure, that Antipholus is
              attempting the very thing that she herself has just counselled him to do, makes
              Luciana somewhat less than morally trustworthy. Perhaps she
              calculatingly tells her sister of Antipholus’s advances simply because she
              wants to make an ostensibly clean breast of the matter. . . . [Then] she may get on
              unmolested with the entertainment of her brother-in-law.

          Haines grants
            that this is heavy stuff. It can only be rejoined that the Luciana that [113] complains of the troubles of the marriage bed while yet
              unmarried and tells her own brother-in-law to try to be more exquisite in the
              deception of his wife, is for many readers and spectators a character difficult to
              understand and not easy to love.

          Ornstein (1986,
            pp. 31–2): In the debate with Luciana Adriana has the last word because here as
              elsewhere in Shakespeare’s plays, platitudinous counsel and painted comforts shatter
              against the hard reality of suffering and anger. Moreover, Luciana is not simply a
              spokesman for conventional pieties; she knows too much about the world to have any
              illusions about the way men treat women. When Antipholus S. woos her, she is not
              horrified even though she thinks him Adriana’s husband. Indignant at his advances, she
              does not, however, threaten to expose his adulterous (indeed,
                incestuous) lust to her sister and she does not rebuff him with pious
              sentences. Instead she pleads with him to be circumspect in his philandering and
              thereby considerate of his wretched wife . . . [quotes 791–8]. On other lips this might seem
              Machiavellian advice, but Luciana’s anger shows through her seeming acceptance of the
              cynical way of the world. She knows too well the emotional dependence of women on men
              and their willingness to deceive themselves about their marriages if their husbands
              will give them half a chance: [32] [quotes 807–8]. It is remarkable that the
              pathos of a woman’s subservience in marriage should be made more explicit in Errors than any other comedy to follow.

          
          Hennings (1986,
            pp. 95 ff.) opposes the view of others—he cites Levin (ed. 1965, p. xxviii) and Barton—that Luciana is the
              play’s spokesperson on the theme of marriage. But their interpretation does not
              explain the further development of Luciana’s character, her charactonymic link and
              structural parallelism to the erotic Luce, or why before the presence of Aemilia,
              Adriana rebukes the contentious Luciana and sides with the Abbess.

          Though she makes the argument for obedience and the double standard, she is running
            against a growing opposition to such behavior, as e.g., the Homilie of
              the state of Matrimonie. (P. 97): Explicitly contradicting Luciana’s
              defense of the double standard, the homily defines the grand folly of human
              nature. He quotes—the gist being that men were to suppress their domineering
            and learn to be equal in affections.

          (P. 98): Furthermore, Luciana’s own confession of why she is not married
              undercuts her pose as a moral advisor. Her claim that she fears the troubles of
                the marriage-bed ([301]) points
              to a reluctance about sexuality and the consequences of childbirth, referred to in the
              homily as griefe and paines, the paine of their
                trauailing,
              great perils, and great afflictions (p. 243 [of Certaine Sermons, 1968]), accurate enough when one considers the
              medical risks of the time and the number of women who died in childbirth. But
              overcoming this natural fear—that is, of being married—is the chief nobility of women,
              advises the sermon, which thereby counters the Catholic claims for celibacy.
            He quotes this is the chiefe ornament of holy matrons . . . in
                that they refused not from marriage for the businesse thereof, for the gifts and
                perils thereof . . . (p. 243). In advising her sister, Luciana does not
              uphold those ideals about marriage and the perfection of women that the original
              audience had been taught to cherish. . . . 

          
            It would be unwise to overlook the charactonymic link between Luce and
              Luciana. In making the commonplace observation that the scenes of Luce and Dromio
              burlesque those of Luciana and Antipholus, we may note that as the drab [!] Luce
              represents the physical level of love, the supposed natural sexual lightness of women,
              so Luciana is thematically linked to her as her [99] higher
              self, a secular, a social or psychological restraint upon human sexuality which proves
              ultimately ineffective in trying to control the sexual appetites. . . . 
          

          
            What is wrong with Luciana is that she here exists solely on a
              superficial secular level. She speaks to the appearances of things and sounds like
              Lady Macbeth: [quotes 798–9]. Where Luce will almost physically mount her partner, Luciana’s
              approach to sexuality more subtly reflects the deep and troubled forces of the
              concupiscible appetites. As Kenneth Muir [1979, p. 21] has observed, she is attracted
              to Antipholus; and Antipholus—suspecting as much, believing that she has taken her own
              advice and is dressing her vice as the herald of virtue—mistakenly comes to regard her
              as a clever temptress pretending to be his sister-in-law inviting him to have an
              affair with her. . . . 
          

          [100] Of course Luciana does not consciously
              offer incest. Like every other major character in the play, she too has a good
              heart. . . . Luciana is not consciously aware of the folded meaning of her words’
              deceit, although Adriana momentarily suspects that her sister’s deeper motives are not
              the least bit noble ([1121]).
          

          Others who comment on Luciana are O’Brien (1878, p. 160): One of the
              Griselda-women . . . the soft, gentle, submissive order; Lewes (1895, pp. 124–6): She is
            attractive, lovely, reasonable, amiable; Smeaton (1910, p. 92): She is nobler than Adriana,
              gentle and yielding . . . but, when occasion demands, staunch in her gracious
              insistence upon all holy virtuous principle; Matthews (1962, p. 69): She is
              spirited, loyal, attractive—the most original figure in the play; Marcotte (1968;
            1971, p. 17): What woman could withhold her love from the man to whom she meant
              all of this (quoting 850–3); he makes up quite a lot in this article; Lloyd Evans (1969,
            pp. 94–5): A sad and honourable woman, brought to the point of suffering for a
              love which is true but seems false; Richmond (1971, p. 62): Confronted with a
              brother-in-law who is an apparent sexual maniac, she remains calm. . . . One should
              be charitable to one’s intimates; Dias (1977, p. 54): She is sane, sober,
              sensible, and sensitive, who is cautiously taken by S. Antipholus’s
            wooing.

        





        
          Pinch

          Hazlitt (1817;
            1930, 4:353): Pinch the conjuror is also an excrescence not to be found in
              Plautus. He is indeed a very formidable anachronism. [Quotes 1715–18.] This is exactly like some
              of the Puritanical portraits to be met with in Hogarth.

          Elliott
            (1939–40, p. 105): Pinch is a tonal masterpiece. His pedantic gravity parodies
              and relieves the increasing angry seriousness of the two Antipholuses. But, above all,
              he bodies forth concretely the play’s spirit of weird fun.

          Tetzeli von
                Rosador (ed. 1982, p. 209) sees Pinch’s function as a scapegoat whose
            torture (1643–50)
            satisfies the spectators’ need for a release of violence called up by the sadistic
            dimension that dwells in any farce.

          Wolfensperger
            (1994, pp. 62–5): How does the comic pedant, who is allowed unusual
              focus and momentary gain in dramatic status, affect our response to Adriana? There is
              no doubt that most of the ridicule in [4.4] is directed against his attempts to
              exorcise EAntipholus’s evil spirits. . . . 

          [63] Shakespeare resorts to two more standard
              comic devices in order to discredit the exorcist: incongruity is one, automatism the
              other. The first [is found in] the discrepancy between self-complacency, flaunted
              learnedness, and pretentiousness and prejudice, ignorance, and blindness,
              which . . . inevitably result in one between effort and effect. Nothing could
              illustrate this incongruity more vividly than . . . [quotes 1335–6], which is answered by
            Antipholus’s blow. The second comic device . . . is what Bergson calls
                &lt;a&gt;utomatisme. . . . Pinch is in his actions guided by an
                idée fixe, which deprives him of
              mental (and physical) flexibility. It makes him utter empty phrases and engage in
              other automatisms. And his actions become highly predictable.

          But he gives no examples. (P. 64): To emphasize the point that Pinch’s practices
              deserve nothing but derision and contempt, let me finally look at his dramatic
              fate . . . [quotes 1641–50]. The utter relentlessness in Shakespeare’s treatment of Doctor Pinch
              leaves no doubt whatsoever that the audience, whether Elizabethan or modern, is meant
              to disapprove unconditionally of his dubious practices. His not being on stage
            in Act 5 likewise means he is to be regarded with great
              suspicion. . . . 

          [65] If we turn to the question of how Pinch
              affects our response to Adriana, we can discover a very paradoxical phenomenon. At
              first sight, he seems to incriminate Adriana and discredit her. After all, it is her
              decision to hire an exorcist in the first place. On the other hand Pinch soon frees
              himself from Adriana to live a dramatic life of his own, so that Shakespeare is able
              to use him as a kind of scapegoat. It is he who is blamed and finally punished for
              errors committed by other characters; he is the scapegoat that
              Shakespeare . . . sacrifices on the altar of genre expectation and persuasive
              strategies. With regard to Adriana and her predisposition to excess and impatience,
              the quack functions as some sort of safety valve, or lightning conductor. With it,
              Shakespeare can divert the reservations and objections we may still have vis-à-vis
              Adriana and direct them against the conjurer.

          Another who comments on Pinch is Drake (1817, 2:289): The pedagogue and conjurer, who
              is sketched in the strongest and most marked style of our author.

        





        
          Solinus

          Claus (1861, p.
            28) and Oechelhäuser, 1885, p. 237) say he responds to Egeon’s long narrative in
            Act 1 with sympathy.

          Kohler (1883,
            p. 117) says he is an oriental despot who has the formal right to override the law in
            Act 5, but no material right.

          Eichhoff (1903,
            p. 80): We like the prince who is strong and just and yet takes a humane interest in all
            who are subordinate to him (Ger.).

          Thaler (1929,
            pp. 55–6) compares the princes of TGV, MND, and Err. as not much more than lay
              figures with only an external relationship to the main action who (p. 56)
              end by forgetting, or at least by silently setting aside, the law or the
              personal objections which had started most of the complications.

          Matheson (1932,
            p. 68): A benevolent arbiter and upholder of the law.

          Bellesort
            (1938, p. 85): He struggles to stay awake in Act 1.

          Arnold (1998)
            explores why Sh. violates genre and long dramatic custom by introducing rulers into
            comedy. He begins with a sketch of the debate gaining strength in the period as to
            whether the prince ruled under the law or above it, whether he ruled absolutely or was
            an officer of the law. He then examines Err., MND and MM. (P. 10): Shakespeare improbably
              introduces [an] absolutist ideal of transcendent authority into his drama not as the
              overweening dream of a tragic or historical protagonist but as the comic desire of
              comic rulers. . . . Shakespeare represents political cultures in which independent
              legal codes impinge on the authority of rulers. Thus, among the young lovers, rustics,
              younger sons, and ethnic marginals seeking to gratify their desires, we also encounter
              rulers who would free themselves from legal limits imposed on their actions. We might
              think of these as constitutionalist comedies, for they enact the tension between the
              law and desire.

          Not only does the law condemning Syracusans to fine or death oppress Egeon, but
              the same law oppresses . . . Solinus, ruler of Ephesus.

          Quoting 145–8, he
            says (p. 11) Solinus’s apposition of the laws of the state and his
              crown, oath, and dignity suggests that his personal power is strictly inscribed within
              the authority of the Ephesian legal code. . . . 

          The Duke’s political status as a mere official of the law is confirmed
              by his inability to exercise that most symbolically important of all princely acts,
              the pardon. Despite his sympathy for the merchant, Solinus confesses to Egeon,
                we may pity though not pardon thee ([100]). Indeed, Solinus strains his authority by granting
              Egeon twenty-four hours [sic] to secure his ransom.

          Hence, when he does pardon Egeon, the act (p. 12) constitutes his own comic
              liberation. The law constrained Solinus’s desire.

          He notes that the pardon seems superfluous, since S. Antipholus has the ransom to free
            his father. (P. 13): Shakespeare, then, stops short of making Solinus’s triumph
              over the law necessary; that is one reason the play does not
              constitute an endorsement of absolutism.

          Comparing MND and Err. (p. 16),
              Both plays register the limits of monarchic power not only by suggesting that
              rulers are appropriate subjects for a vulgar literary form but also by figuring the
              ruler’s assertion of unimpaired power as a comic fantasy.

        

      

    






    
      The Comedy of Errors on the Stage




      
        Staging

        
        The play may be performed by 12 men and 4 boys, with, probably, a minimum of 4
          nonspeaking extras, resources well within the capabilities of whatever acting company
          performed the play, either after the establishment of the Lord Chamberlain’s men in 1594,
          or earlier, by an unknown company (Strange’s? Pembroke’s?) (Gurr, 1996, pp. 59 f.). Actually
          there are 19 speaking roles, but doubling the Jailor, the Officer in 4.1 and 4.4 (and the
          silent Headsman in Act 5); the First and Second Merchant; Balthazar and the Messenger of
          Act 5; and Luce (perhaps never seen) and the Courtesan produces what would have to be the
          minimum cast of 16, 12 men and 4 boys (Act 5 calls for 13 speaking parts and the silent
          Headsman; Pinch, undoubled, and Luce do not appear). Casting 4 others would
          bring the total needed to 20.

        Engelen (1926,
          pp. 43–4) notes the technical possibility of five doublings: Solinus and the Officer in
          Act 4; Aegeon and Pinch, S. Antipholus and the Messenger in Act 5; the First Merchant and
          Angelo, and Balthazar and the Second Merchant. She doubts that Luce appears, but thinks
          she could double with Luciana. Because Engelen apparently does not count the Jailor’s four
          words in 1.1, she has 18 speaking roles, which after doubling could be played by 13
          actors. She grants that doubling S. Antipholus and the Messenger is merely possible, but
          unlikely because of the dominance of S. Antipholus’s role and the ease of other
          doublings.

        Baldwin (1927,
          chart inserted pp. 228–9) assigns the chief speaking parts to actors he knows or believes
          to be active and available to Sh. in 1588–91. He says, for example, that Sh. played
          Solinus, William Kemp played E. Dromio, Henry Cundall (his spelling) played Adriana, and
          so on. His assumption that Sh. was already a member of a stable acting company in 1588 has
          not been widely accepted. This company, he believes, played Rom.
          and H5 in 1590–1. He was anticipated in this casting by Sarrazin (1897, p.
          107), who suggests that Kemp played one Dromio, Thomas Pope perhaps the other, Sh. and
          Burbage the Antipholuses—Sh. perhaps the warmer S. Antipholus—and Edward
          Alleyn played Egeon, though he knows that Alleyn belonged to Sh.’s company only in
          1593.

        Ringler (1968, p.
          123 n.) says that Err. requires a minimum cast of 14 (see above),
          but does not cast the parts.

        Harbage (ed.
          1969, p. 31), in a table for all the plays, casts Err. for 11 men
          and 5 women; these are the named roles, but apparently he leaves out the Jailor,
          Messenger, and Officer.

        King (1992, p.
          80): Eight men can play eight principal and one minor male roles; five boys play
            five principal female roles. These thirteen actors speak 97% of the lines. . . . In
            minor parts, five men can play four speaking parts and seven mutes, for a total
          of 18. He counts Luce’s 11 lines as a major role, but doubles First Merchant’s 15 lines
          (in 1.2), Pinch’s 12 (4.4), and Messenger’s 14 (5.1) as minor roles. Doubling Pinch seems
          problematic because he is described with such particularity (1715–18).
        

        The play calls for three specific locales, the houses of E. Antipholus (the Phoenix), of
          the Courtesan (the Porcupine), and the abbey. Much of the action takes place in an area
          called the Mart. A stage direction reads Enter Dromio
            Syra. from the Bay (1073). On the
          public stage there were two doors flanking an aperture, usually covered by a tapestry
          hanging (see Gurr &amp;
              Ichikawa, 2000,  below). Presumably one of the doors
          would have to do double service as the abode of E. Antipholus or of the Courtesan and as
          the entrance to the bay, since there is no evidence of entrances through the audience to
          the stage.

        How to manage the lock-out scene (3.1) is another problem. Wells (ed. 1972, pp.
          145–6): The location is before Antipholus of Ephesus’s house, in which his twin is
            dining with Adriana and Luciana. Dromio of Syracuse is guarding the gate, with
            instructions to let no one in. . . . At line [651], Antipholus tries the door and finds it locked. Dromio of Syracuse speaks
            from behind the door, and so is out of sight. . . . [146] It may
            be that Dromio of Syracuse, Luce, and Adriana should be out of sight of the audience
            throughout the scene. But they have so much to say that this seems clumsy. Another
            possibility is that some convention should be employed whereby the audience can see both
            sets of actors, but they are understood not to see one another. There is no reason why
            Luce should not come into the presence of the on-stage party, but it is necessary that
            the Dromios should be kept apart, and that Adriana should not confront her real husband
            at this stage of the play. It may well be that the main point of bringing Luce on here
            is to have some servant other than Dromio to sustain the altercation. To have Luce throw
            the words What a coil is there, Dromio! Who are these at the gate?
            (line[s 680–1]) behind
            her to an invisible Dromio seems clumsy, and there is something to be said in favour of
            the suggestion that Luce and perhaps Adriana should enter on an upper level—the upper
            stage of the Elizabethan theatre. This may be suggested by Adriana’s statement that she
            and her supposed husband would dine above ([603]). However, it sounds from line [701: Let him knocke till it ake] as if Luce
            were expected to be able to open the door herself, rather than simply instruct Dromio to
            do so. . . . The producer is free to engineer the scene in his own way.

        Last, in Act 5, S. Antipholus and his servant flee into and emerge from the abbey. How
          that was managed on the Gray’s Inn stage, described below, or on any stage fitted with
          free-standing houses which might be quite small and thus crowded with three
          actors, is a problem.

        The first recorded performance was at Gray’s Inn. See , for an account of what happened on
          that occasion. Here I examine what can be known or guessed at about the staging
          itself.

        Gray’s Inn hall (see diagram in Knapp &amp; Kobialka, 1984, p. 74, but
          notice that the compass points east and west are reversed) measures 70′ by 34′8″,
          dimensions similar to those of two Cambridge college halls also occasionally used for
          performances, Queen’s (44′ x 27′) and Trinity (85′ x 40′) (Nelson, 1994, pp. 17, 43). The hall
          featured a dais (half-pace) at the so-called upper end and a hall screen with two openings
          in its five arches at the lower end, with a gallery above it, an oriel (bay) window on the
          north side of the half-pace, and a possibly 7′-sq. fireplace roughly in the middle of the
          hall, centered on the width but about 30 feet from the upper-end wall and a little farther
          from the other end. The hall was damaged by bombs and fire during the Second World War,
          but not seriously, and with the exception of the removal of the fireplace and construction
          of a second oriel window opposite the first, it looks very much as it did in Sh.’s day,
          though the screen does not certainly date from before 1594.

        Gray’s Inn mounted an elaborate revels lasting with breaks from about 12 Dec. 1594 to
          Shrove Tuesday 1595, when a final masque was performed before the queen at court. Sometime
          after 20 Dec., certainly by 28 Dec., until about 4 Jan., a stage and scaffolds (bleachers)
          were erected in the hall, and for an unknown period an elevated chair of state for the
          prince of the revels was placed on the half-pace. At his enthronement on 20 Dec.,
            The Prince, with all his Train in Order . . . took his place in his Throne,
            under a rich Cloth of State: His Counsellors and great Lords were placed about him, and
            before him; below the Half-pace, at a Table, sate his learned Council and
            Lawyers (Gesta Grayorum, the account of the revels, ed.
          Bland, 1968, p. 13).

        Nelson (1992 and 1994) shows that college halls likewise employed
          scaffolds ranged along the walls, above the screen in the gallery, and sometimes against
          the upper-end wall overlooking the stage. Performances in these halls were on a stage that
          covered the dais, not apparently the way Gray’s Inn hall was configured, but otherwise
          useful for comparison. The timbers that transformed the halls into theaters were used over
          a period of many years, put up and taken down whenever occasion demanded. Plays had been
          performed at Gray’s Inn—Jocasta and Supposes in 1566 and The Misfortunes of Arthur perhaps
          in 1587—so Gray’s may have had what Nelson calls a demountable stage and seating. At the
          mock trial following the disaster of overcrowding and near riot on 28 Dec., the
            Sorcerer or Conjuror who had presumably arranged for Err. to be played was charged because he had caused the Stage to be
            built, and Scaffolds to be reared to the top of the House, to increase
            Expectation (Gesta Grayorum, ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 32,
          70). This charge could either point to a new construction—very expensive—or, considering
              the Stage, not a Stage,
          to the erection of a demountable one. In any event, the stage and scaffolding were taken
          down on the command of the (p. 70) Readers and Ancients of the House, by reason of
            the Term, to free up space the lawyers and students needed for eating.

        Knapp &amp; Kobialka (1984) believe that the stage was erected in the
          space between the half-pace and the fireplace, a stage (p. 77) about nine feet deep
            and as wide as the hall, that is, thirty-four feet, eight inches. This is a
          depth close to the 10′2″ at Queen’s (Nelson, 1994, p. 29) but quite shallow. Nelson judges that the
          stages in Cambridge were six feet high, but might vary from hall to hall. The space in
          front of the stage between the fireplace and the hall screen, with the scaffolding aligned
          along both sides, was left open for the frequent dancing that formed part of the revelry.
          Such a position for the stage meant that at least half the audience saw the play from the
          rear, though the height of the scaffolding where they sat (to the top of the
            House) improved sight lines; besides, actors were accustomed to playing to three
          or four sides of the public stage. Entrance to the stage could be through the door at the
          right rear of the half-pace, though actors would have to squeeze past the audience seated
          around the prince; or through the doors in the screen, forcing them to walk half the
          length of the hall and climb to the stage. Or they might wait in the tiring houses
          described below, if Gray’s Inn had such structures. Hotson (1954, facing p. 136) has a
          reconstruction of Whitehall that anticipates Knapp &amp; Kolbialka in some features,
          especially the staging in the middle of the hall and the use of the bleachers.

        Mahood (2000, p.
          36) favors entrances and exits at the dais end.

        Nelson (1994, p.
          108) demonstrates that cloth houses were used on the Cambridge stages,
          sometimes in clearly facing pairs. He also shows (pp. 24–9) that the
          Queen’s and Trinity College stages had tiring houses integrated into the stage at the left
          and right ends, straightforward three-storey structures, measuring
          (Queen’s) 11′2″ by 4′8″. Something similar seems to have characterized the Gray’s Inn
          stage. On 3 Jan. another large company gathered to be entertained. Gesta
            Grayorum (ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 35–6): When they were all thus
            placed and setled in very good Order, the Prince came into the Hall [from the screen
            end] with his wonted State, and ascended his Throne at the high End of the Hall, under
            His Highness’s Arms; and after him came the Ambassador of Templaria, with his Train likewise [and were duly seated]. Then, after variety
            of Musick, they were presented with this Device.

        
          At the side of the Hall, behind a Curtain, was erected an Altar to the
            Goddess of Amity; her Arch-Flamen, ready to attend the Sacrifice and Incense that
            should, by her Servants, be offered unto her: Round about the same sate Nymphs and
            Fairies, with Instruments of Musick, and made very pleasant Melody with Viols and
            Voices, and sang Hymns and Praises to her Deity.
        

        Then issued forth of another Room the first pair of Friends . . . [who]
            offered Incense upon the Altar to [36] their Goddess.
          Those two Friends, as they are called in Gesta Grayorum, are
          followed by eight more characters in the masque, which celebrates the renewed friendship
          of Gray’s Inn and the Inner Temple. At each side of the hall, behind curtains, there must
          have been enough space to enclose at least ten masquers. The oriel window on the north
          side of the half-pace juts out 4′7″, running from the floor to midway up the wall; it
          would suggest itself as an acting space save that it is an extension of the dais, where
          the dignitaries are seated, and it lacks its counterpart across the dais on the south
          side.

        Kernodle (1944,
          p. 133) describes staging of four plays presented in the Inns of Court, Gorboduc (1561 at the Inner Temple), Jocasta (1566 at
          Gray’s), Gismond of Salerne (1567 at the Inner Temple), and
            The Misfortunes of Arthur (1587 perhaps at Gray’s). All four
          need two side doors and a centered acting space. Of Jocasta he
          writes: [It] had the most interesting façade of all . . . a façade in the
            centuries old pattern of a central castle gate flanked by two side doors. Here the
            central castle was the palace doorway of Jocasta; and of The
            Misfortunes of Arthur, produced just seven years before Err: A complex background even more like the public stage façade was
            used. Two entranceways . . . served as the houses of Mordred and of Arthur . . . ; and
            a third entrance is spoken of at one moment as the cloister of the nuns,
          reminding us of the abbey in Err. These stages fit well enough
          with those Nelson
          describes and offer the same problems of just who got to see what if the plays were staged
          as Knapp &amp; Kobialka propose, rather than at one or the other end of the
          hall, as I think most discussions assume. There is the added fact that now only one door
          opens to the dais; the east wall has been paneled and I find no evidence that another door
          used to exist.

        At the 300th-anniversary production at Gray’s, 14 Dec. 1895, the stage was set at the
          screen end, using the two doors. At the 400th anniversary, the stage was set along the
          lower end of the north wall, the gallery, and the screen—a right-angle set.

        Hodges (in Dorsch, ed. 1988, p.
          27) illustrates a stage built over the dais. The throne for the revels prince is on stage
          at the right, surrounded by courtiers, and another group of courtiers is opposite; the
          action of the play takes place in the constricted remainder of the stage. At the rear of
          the stage is an arras hiding the tiring house and at the front are steps leading from the
          floor of the hall to the stage, which is about three feet high.

        Using the same illustration, Hodges (1999, p. 150) says of the lock-out scene: Though this may
            be staged in any number of fanciful ways, in fact the only article of scenery that is
            really needed . . . is the door itself. It should be remembered that the Chamberlain’s
            Men had mounted this play at Gray’s Inn at very short notice. With no time at all to
            make special arrangements, I suggest they simply brought themselves and their costumes
            with one property door across from Bankside to Gray’s Inn, and with only the clearing of
            some space on the stage everything was thus ready for them. For this scene, on cue, two
            of their tire men carried in and held the door as needed. His solution is very
          attractive but, as he admits, he has reduced the number of spectators on stage from those
          implied in Gesta (see )
          and has retained, in front of the dais, the table, which almost certainly was removed.
          Hodges does not address the Knapp &amp; Kobialka proposal.

        In illustrating the stages in Cambridge University colleges, Nelson (1994, pp. 17, 41) apparently
          shows the dais as covered by the stage, but he says only that the stages were
            near the upper end of the hall.

        The interest in these structures lies particularly in how to stage the lock-out of E.
          Antipholus in Act 3 and the entry into and return from the abbey in Act 5. Fabric houses
          arranged across the stage would block the view of that part of audience seated below the
          raised stage unless the houses were set up as clearly facing pairs (Nelson, 1994, p. 108)
          at the ends of the stage. Perhaps such structures could be semipermanent features of the
          demountable stage. Tiring houses fitted with doors and possibly windows on an upper level
          would answer many questions about staging those two scenes.

        
        It used to be thought that plays might be staged using the screen as a tiring–house
          facade. But Nelson
          (1992, pp. 69–70) makes these objections: First, halls of all kinds were
            constructed with social hierarchies in mind. Normally, the higher orders sat at the
            higher end, the lower orders at the lower end. The logical place for performances was
            the space just in front of or at the sides of the high table. A performance at the lower
            end of the hall would be less accessible to the head of household and to guests seated
            on the dais at the upper end of the hall, and might well be thought to violate
            proprieties. . . . 

        
          Second, the screens served as the principal entrance to the hall [70] for the majority of guests, especially those of lower rank.
            Staging a play hard against the screens would either block this normal means of access
            and egress, or would restrict the stage platform to the width of the space between the
            doors. Further, a platform erected in front of the screen doors not only might block the
            normal swing of the doors, but would take an inch from the height of the door opening
            for every inch of the height of the stage. A five-foot stage would require a ten-foot
            door to make a five-foot entrance. . . . 
        

        
          Third, hall screens in late Tudor times were ornately decorated: it is
            difficult to believe that they were routinely and deliberately subjected to the hard use
            virtually inevitable in the course of a dramatic performance.
        
        

        Dorsch (ed. 1988,
          pp. 23–4), believing that there were five handsome arched doorways in the
          screen, proposes a staging at the screen end (p. 24): The three inner
            doors . . . would have served admirably as the entrances to the houses of Antipholus
            and the Courtesan, and to the priory. The two outer doors could well have been left open
            to represent the ways leading to the port and the city. Gray’s Inn hall screen
          has, however, always had just two doors (and it is not certain that the present screen was
          in place in 1594 [Caplan, 1988]). Dorsch’s proposal is wholly accepted by Riehle (1990, p. 21)
          and provisionally accepted by Gurr &amp; Ichikawa (2000, pp. 102–3). Mahood (2000, p. 55
          n.) and Ichikawa
          (2002, p. 168 n.) confirm that the screen has always had two doors.

        Once one has hypothesized about staging under the unusual circumstances at Gray’s Inn, a
          question arises about what Sh. had in mind when he conceived the play, and this is a
          question that is connected to the unsettled question of when he wrote it. His casting of
          the play, including the characters he added to Plautus’s play, argues that he knew what
          resources he had available to him. If he wrote Err. specifically
          for its first performance at Gray’s Inn in 1594, counting on staging methods (including
          three houses) that would allow him a classical flavor, then the report in
            Gesta Grayorum that the performance was huddled together at a
          moment’s notice is a palpable fiction (which it may indeed be). Err. was also played at court in 1604, and most likely in the public
          playhouses. Elizabethan staging was nothing if not flexible, but in what follows scholars
          openly or implicitly choose only one of the alternatives.

        Wilson (ed. 1922,
          pp. 81–2, 98): The chief difficulty . . . is to determine the relative positions
            of the Mart and the house of Antipholus. At times they seem some distance apart, at
            times they are close together, if not in the same locality. . . . We have come to the
            conclusion that the most satisfactory arrangement for a modern reader’s text is to
            alternate between two localities: (i) an open space before the house of Antipholus,
            which will have the priory on one side and a street-exit on the other, and (ii) the
            Mart, which will have the Courtesan’s house in the centre and street-exits, one of them
            leading to the bay, on either side. We believe too that those responsible for the text,
            as we have it, kept those two localities more or less in mind, distinguishing them at
            the time of performance by means of placards, when necessary. Evidently the play was to
            be acted upon a simple platform with three doors at the back, and no
            inner-stage. He goes through the scenes, showing what placards would have to be
          erected. Possibly the three doors . . . were simply the entrances to the painted
              houses which are known to have been used on the academic and court
            stage; [82] but it is not necessary to our argument to suppose
            this, since the bare dais of a hall, with three doors at the back, would
            serve. . . . The obvious necessity for an upper-stage in 3.1., a scene which must have
            lost much of its effect when played in a hall without a gallery . . . suggest[s] that
            [Sh.] had the ordinary Elizabethan stage in mind throughout. (P. 98, on 679): In a public playhouse, for which
            this scene is clearly arranged, S. Dromio would be within i.e. behind the
            door or curtain at the back of the inner-stage, while Luce and Adriana would appear on
            the balcony which overhangs the inner-stage. All previous edd. have placed the two women
              within with S. Dromio. Such an arrangement is extremely awkward from
            the theatrical point of view, since the audience would be greatly puzzled by three
            unseen characters, more especially as one of them appears nowhere else in the play. Luce
            and Adriana, on the upper-stage, could be seen by the audience without themselves seeing
            E. Dromio and E. Antipholus, who would be at the door out of sight under the balcony. On
            the other hand at a performance such as that at Gray’s Inn . . . where no inner-stage
            and probably no balcony would be available, the three characters would have to be
              within. Gray’s Inn hall has a balcony over the screen end, but
          Wilson seems to envision the dais as the stage. Gray’s Inn hall has only a single door
          opening to the dais.

        Chambers (1930,
          1:307–8): Probably the stage was set in the same way throughout. At the back of the
            stage three houses or doors represented to the right and left the Priory with some
            religious emblem over it, and the Courtesan’s house with the sign of the Porpentine, and
            in the centre the house of Antipholus with the sign of the Phoenix. As Wilson [ed. 1922,
            p. 98] points out, Adriana [308] and Luce must here appear
              above in iii. I. There is no other action above and none within; all is
            either at the doors of the houses, or in an open place, often referred to as the
              mart. The mart scenes were played at the front of the stage, and the
            side entrances were supposed to lead to the bay and to the town respectively. But while
            characters sometimes seem to move direct from the mart to the houses, there are also
            passages which suggest that they go off the stage on the way between these. Such
            inconsistencies would probably not be much felt in a bustling action.

        Alexander (1939,
          pp. 68–9), arguing that Sh. did not have the Elizabethan stage in mind, but rather that of
          classic convention: One side entrance leads to the Bay, the other to the Town. This
            was the proper classic setting for the stage, since the Comedy, which was Shakespeare’s
            model, was born at Athens between [69] the Bay and the Town. And
            the courtesy of convention allowed Comedy to enjoy the advantages she was born to, even
            in cities where they were unsanctioned by the laws of nature. Plautus in his Amphitruo gives a harbour to Thebes.

        Greg (1942; 1954,
          p. 140): In The Comedy of Errors the remarkable directions
              from the Courtezan’s,
            from the Bay,
            to the Priory,
            to the Abbess point clearly to a set stage with three houses and
            entrances between. The play cannot therefore have been written for the public theatre,
            and in fact the earliest recorded performance was on 28 Dec. 1594 at Gray’s
          Inn.

        Foakes (ed. 1962,
          pp. xxxiv ff.): The Comedy of Errors is unique
            among Shakespeare’s plays in the way localities are indicated . . . ; it seems to
            require only four playing-areas, or at the most five, three of which were clearly marked
            by signs [i.e., placards]. These localities are the street ([659] etc.) or mart ([239], etc.), presumably the main playing area
            of the stage; the house of Antipholus of Ephesus, called the Phoenix ([240]); the house of the Courtesan, called the
            Porpentine (i.e. Porcupine, [777]); and the
            Priory which houses the Abbess ([1502]). It
            is possible that an upper storey or gallery in the house of Antipholus was also used
              ([603 . . . ; 679]), [xxxv] but is not essential to
            the play’s action. The evidence of the text points to one conclusion [he quotes Chambers on the
            three houses]. . . . 

        
          The text indicates a continuous action on a stage with three fixed
            locations, which could have been houses, shallow structures from which
            characters could speak or make entries. The use of houses . . . was
            common in Court productions, and standard practice in the dramaturgy of Lyly, from whom
            Shakespeare learned much in writing his play. However, Shakespeare may also have had in
            mind the traditions of Gray’s Inn, if The Comedy of Errors was
            written for performance there. For the educated gentlemen of the Inns of Court were
            familiar with the conventionalized arcade setting with which Renaissance editors
            illustrated editions of Terence and Plautus, apparently in the belief that they were
            imitating the Roman stage. In these arcades, each compartment would represent a house or
              domus, and it seems that staging at the Inns of Court followed this
            pattern [quotes Kernodle, above]. . . . [xxxvi] All these
            [plays] had three fixed locations, and an arcade with three doors such as that used for
              Jocasta and possibly for The Misfortunes of
              Arthur would have served admirably for The Comedy of
              Errors, which seems to call for exactly this kind of setting.
        

        He quotes Alexander (above). This is a reasonable suggestion, but I
            do not think we need suppose that Shakespeare had read Vitruvius, or realized what was a
              proper classic setting; his reading of Plautus would have been enough,
            for Menaechmi and Amphitruo clearly
            indicate a harbour and a city. . . . 

        
          However, the indications in stage-directions and within the text all
            suggest a simple staging of a special kind. It is tempting to suppose that this short
            play, with its classical background, was designed for performance in a hall with no
            gallery, and for an audience used to houses on stage, and perhaps
            familiar with the [xxxvii] kind of arcade setting to be seen in
            several editions of Terence.
        

        He quotes Wilson,
          but observes that notions of Elizabethan staging have become simplified since 1922—an
          overhanging balcony and an inner stage with door at the rear are no longer believed to
          have existed. He wonders whether one or more stage doors included a wicket or
            aperture in the upper part, as seems to be suggested by the jesting cry of Dromio of
            Syracuse to his [xxxviii] twin, Either get thee from this
              door, or sit down at the hatch ([655] . . . ). The aperture may have been a half-door, or at least large enough
            for several figures to be visible to the audience, and Luce certainly appears from the
            dialogue to be located within the door . . . [quotes 692, 698]. In
            addition, there is little evidence for the use of a gallery here; at [603–4] Adriana says Husband, I’ll dine above with you to-day, And shrive you of a thousand idle
              pranks, but it is doubtful whether this can be taken literally as referring to
            the stage. . . . [xxxix] It seems to me that Luce and Adriana
            are meant to be visible to the audience in this scene, while apparently, or in
            supposition, remaining concealed from Antipholus of Ephesus and his companions, and that
            this could be more easily and convincingly staged by using a structure on stage than by
            placing the mistress and her maid on a balcony.

        Kinney (1988, p.
          44) believes that one of the three doors has the sign of the Centaur over it, and he
          misrepresents Chambers and Foakes: But the priory cannot be the same doorway as the Phoenix
            as previous critics claim, beginning with E. K. Chambers, for Antipholus and Dromio of
            Syracuse are running out of that to the
            priory; nor can it be the door of the Centaur, for they are running away from their
            worldly goods to a place of holy sanctuary. He believes that the Porcupine
          becomes the abbey. [The Centaur is an inn at the port, offstage.]

        
        Gurr &amp; Ichikawa (2000, pp. 96, 103): It is generally
            agreed that Shakespeare’s playhouses had three entryways in the frons, i.e. two flanking doors and a central doorway or
            aperture. . . . 

        [103] Assuming the play was performed in a public
            playhouse, it is not certain whether the three houses might have been represented by the
            same doors throughout the performance, for not only the three houses but also the
            standard entryways had to be represented by the three entries of the tiring-house wall.
            The doors for entrances and exits in this play are uniquely odd and distinctive. It does
            seem most likely that each house was represented by the same door at least throughout
            each scene when the three locations were in use.

        I think that when Err. was staged at Gray’s Inn or at court,
            houses were employed, and when it was performed in public playhouses, the
          three doors served the needs of the play.
        

        Two essays speak about the conceptual significance of the staging.

        Brooks (1961, p.
          70): The development of the action is supported by the use made of the stage-set.
            Acts II and III are focused upon the Phoenix, scene of the central crisis. Act IV brings
            into play the second domus, the
            Porpentine, and in accord with the fast-extending complications has no one focal point:
            the action is related by turns to the Phoenix, the Porpentine, and neither. The third
              domus, the Abbey, is kept in reserve as
            the appropriate focus for the dénouement.

        Bevington (1984,
          pp. 108–9): If we turn to neoclassic tradition [from Tudor drama and royal
            and civic entertainment] . . . with its emphasis on ambiguity and surprise, we find
            Shakespeare using the stage façade to frame a world of illusion, escape, and rebellion
            against authority. . . . 

        
          If, as seems likely, Shakespeare began his exploration of such liminal
            spatial relationships in The Comedy of Errors, his indebtedness
            to neoclassic theater is clear enough. In modified form he seems to have [109] adopted the model set forth in Ralph Roister
              Doister and Gammer Gurton’s Needle, for example,
            where two or more houses face on a street scene throughout the play. Shakespeare
            evidently intends one stage door to represent the dwelling of Antipholus of Ephesus
            throughout, with the Abbey near at hand and represented by another door. What attracts
            Shakespeare to such a setting is not the verisimilar scenic effect—there is no
            indication that scenery or stage housing was used in the original production—but rather
            the spatial interconnection of the main stage and the space lying within. The stage
            façade becomes a part of Shakespeare’s comedy of illusion and misunderstanding, much as
            it must have done on Plautus’ and Terence’s stage before him. Antipholus of Ephesus
            arrives at one point to find his house door—presumably a door in the tiring-house
            façade—locked against him. He and his servant . . . call in vain to those in the house,
            who speak apparently from within. When Luce and then Adriana enter and
            yet are presumed to be still inside the house, they may be visible to the audience as
            they stand in the gallery or some such acting area, out of sight of the frustrated
            master and his servant on the main stage ([680–705]). The façade thus expresses misunderstanding and
            inversion between husband and wife and between servant and servant; it is a device of
            complication.
        

        
          Later in the play . . . this same façade becomes the means of revelation
            and discovery. It is through the stage door representing the Abbey that the Abbess
            emerges with Antipholus and Dromio of Syracusa to undeceive all those who have begun to
            question their own sanity. The actors’ tiring-house contains all secrets and eventually
            explains all mysteries; with its two or more doors, it is at once the source of comic
            confusion and eventual clarification. The apertures into the façade are not, on
            Shakespeare’s illusionistic stage, simply a means of allowing characters to appear from
            and disappear into an understood offstage location; they stress a duality between what
            is seen and unseen, between what a character supposes to be within and what in fact is
            to be found there. The stage façade is an essential source of illusion in the liminal
            world of Shakespeare’s first comedy of mistaken identities.
        

        Many object to the unacceptable improbability of identical twins: Bräker (1780; tr. 1979, p. 51):
          Adriana is deaf, and idiotic into the bargain, to insist that another man was [her]
            husband; similarly Duport (1828, 2:266). Schlegel (1809–11; tr. 1815, 2:158): In such pieces we
            must, to give to the senses at least an appearance of truth, always pre-suppose that the
            parts by which the misunderstandings are occasioned are played with masks, and this the
            poet no doubt observed.
          Fleay (1876, p.
          25): It is seldom acted, the extreme difficulty of obtaining two pairs of actors
            sufficiently like to realize the errors enough for modern taste being
            insurmountable.

        For Hazlitt’s
          (1817; 1930, 4:351) comments on keeping the twins straight, see .

        Knight (1849, p.
          117) disagrees with Hazlitt, though he confesses never to have seen the play: It
            appears to us that every one of an audience . . . who keeps his
            eyes open, will, after he has become a little familiar with the persons of [the two sets
            of twins], find out some clue by which he can detect a difference between each.
          He quotes Schlegel
          above on masks. Whether masks, properly so called, were used in Shakspere’s time in
            the representation of this play, we have some doubt. But . . . each pair of persons
            selected to play the twins must be of the same height . . . and be dressed with
            apparently perfect similarity. But let every care be taken to make the deception
            perfect, and yet the observing spectator will detect a difference between each; some
            peculiarity of the voice, some trick o’ the eye, some dissimilarity in
            gait, some minute variation in dress.

        Haines (1978, p.
          109) worries about just how identically the twins are to be costumed: If they are
            dressed identically, the other characters are at least partially justified in their
            mistakes and confusions (although it is not easy to justify a wife’s failing to
            recognize her own husband at intimate range); but, too, if they are dressed identically
            (and two sets of actors have been found who will prove indistinguishable), the audience
            will themselves be confused for at least a part of the evening. Is it well, the director
            must decide, to have the audience know something that the characters on the stage do not
            know? Is it funnier? . . . How is it, too, that the Antipholi, and the Dromii, speak
            exactly alike, with no trace of a foreign accent to betray them? These
            matters are the stuff of which farce is made.

        Others who comment on the staging of the play are Stroup (1965, p. 100): Though one
          doesn’t expect pageantry and ceremony in Roman-based comedies, a half-dozen entrances and
          exits require formation, four of them being the Duke and his
            attendants. The pageantry and ceremony occur in material Sh. added to his Roman
          sources. Wells
          (1966, p. 107) on the subdued ending of Err., not the promised
          gossips’ feast: But the actual ending of most of the comedies is subdued in tone.
            This fact is of course inseparable from practical considerations. The Elizabethan
            theatre had no curtain to fall on a festive tableau.
          Charney (1971, pp.
          21–2) considers the stage properties, the bag of gold, the chain, rope’s end, diamond
          ring, that visually define the play’s distinctive mercantile atmosphere. Holmes (1972, p. 36):
            The parts of Adriana . . . , Helena in A Midsummer Night’s
              Dream, and, to a lesser degree, Bianca, in The Taming of the
              Shrew call for a player who can be at the same time genuinely pitiable and
            slightly absurd.
          Williams (1982,
          pp. 34 ff.) offers as one staging plan a neo-classic design based on 15th-
          and 16th-c. illustrations of Terence and Plautus, as in Foakes (ed. 1962, pp. xxxviii f.), as
          well as other contemporary paintings. The set has the abbey on the left, the Porcupine on
          the right, the Phoenix next to it, and in the center a thrust out blank section with
          gallery above and a centered window (optional, depending on how the lock-out scene is
          played). He recommends costumes based on those illustrations.

      





      
        Performances

        Err. has been one of the least performed of Sh.’s comedies.
          Sometimes decades have passed between recorded performances, and, regrettably, there are
          next to no descriptions of settings, costumes, acting styles, or the achievements of
          individuals in their roles. Since the 1960s, this dearth has been corrected, largely owing
          to Clifford Williams’s revival at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1962, and the play is now
          performed regularly. The standard stage histories I have drawn on are Genest (1832), Odell (1927–49 and 1920),
            Hogan (1952–7),
            The London Stage 1660–1800, Wearing (1976–93), Kemp &amp; Trewin (1953), Mullin &amp; Muriello (1980), Gooch, Thatcher, et al. (1991), Mullin (1994), the annual surveys in SQ, and theater reviews in the London Times and the
            New York Times. In addition to the stage histories, commentary
          can be found in Child (in Wilson, ed. 1922), Campbell &amp; Quinn (1966, pp.
          132–5), Babula
          (1981), Leiter
          (1986), Maguire
          (1997, pp. 359–81), and Holland (1997). Rothwell &amp; Melzer (1990, pp. 41–5)
          provide a list with commentary on film and video productions.

        
        1594Gray’s Inn and Gesta Grayorum. The
          first recorded performance of The Comedy of Errors is that at
          Gray’s Inn on 28 Dec., Holy Innocents’ Day, 1594, recorded in the Gesta
            Grayorum, which was published in 1688. In May and June 1594 the Admiral’s men
          and the Chamberlain’s men were formed to make some order out of the chaotic playing
          conditions caused in part by the extended closure of the London acting houses during the
          plague of mid 1592–mid 1594. The Admiral’s company played at court on 28 Dec. (Chambers, 1923,
          4:109), freeing Sh.’s company, themselves at court on the two previous nights, to play at
          Gray’s Inn. Gesta Grayorum implies that the actors were called on
          the spur of the moment to calm what looked to be turning into a riot. If so, what good
          fortune to have a short Plautine comedy at hand. Here is the report of the event (ed.
          Bland, 1968, pp. 29–34): The next grand Night was intended to be upon Innocents-Day at Night; at which time there was a great Presence of
            Lords, Ladies, and worshipful Personages, that did expect some notable Performance at
            that time; which, indeed, had been effected, if the multitude of Beholders had not been
            so exceeding great, that thereby there was no convenient room for those that were
            Actors; by reason whereof, very good Inventions and Conceipts could not have opportunity
            to be applauded, which otherwise would have been great Contentation to the
            Beholders. About 9:00 p.m. the Inner Temple sent an ambassador with a large
          entourage to pay a formal visit to the mock prince of Purpoole, Henry Helmes, a law
          student, and was conducted to a (p. 30) Chair besides His Highness, to the end that
            he might be Partaker of the Sports intended. Polite speeches followed,
          emphasizing the long friendship between the Temple and Gray’s Inn.

        (P. 31): When the Ambassador was placed, as aforesaid, and that
            there was something to be performed for the Delight of the Beholders, there arose such a
            disordered Tumult and Crowd upon the Stage, that there was no Opportunity to effect that
            which was intended: There came so great a number of worshipful Personages upon the
            Stage, that might not be displaced; and Gentlewomen, whose Sex did privilege them from
            Violence, that when the Prince and his Officers had in vain, a good while, expected and
            endeavoured a Reformation, at length there was no hope of Redress for that present. The
            Lord Ambassador and his Train thought that they were not so kindly entertained, as was
            before expected, and thereupon would not stay any longer at that time, but, in a sort,
            discontented and displeased. After their Departure the Throngs and Tumults did somewhat
            cease, although so much of them continued, as was able to disorder and confound any good
            Inventions whatsoever. In regard whereof, as also for that the Sports intended were
            especially for the gracing of the Templarians, it was thought
            good not to offer any thing of Account, [32] saving Dancing and
            Revelling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to Plautus his Menechmus) was played by the
            Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and
            Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, The Night of
              Errors.

        The uproar led the Lawyers of the Prince’s Council to set up a mock court
          of inquiry concerning some great Disorders and Abuses lately done and
            committed with[in] his Highness’s Dominions of Purpoole,
            especially by Sorceries and Inchantments; and namely, of a great Witchcraft used the
            Night before, whereby there were great Disorders and Misdemeanours, by Hurly-burlies,
            Crowds, Errors, Confusions, vain Representations and Shews, to the utter Discredit of
            our State and Policy.

        The next Night upon this Occasion, we preferred Judgments thick and
            threefold, which were read publickly by the Clerk of the Crown, being all against a
            Sorcerer or Conjurer that was supposed to be the Cause of that confused Inconvenience.
            Therein was contained, How he had caused the Stage to be built, and Scaffolds to be
            reared to the top of the House, to increase Expectation. He is also charged with
          inviting throngs to the party, disgracing the Templars, and disappointing them of the
          expected entertainments. Also that he caused Throngs and Tumults, [33] Crowds and Outrages, to disturb our whole Proceedings. And
            Lastly, that he had foisted a Company of base and common Fellows, to make up our
            Disorders with a Play of Errors and Confusions; and that that Night had gained to us
            Discredit, and it self a Nickname of Errors. All which were against the Crown and
            Dignity of our Sovereign Lord, the Prince of Purpoole.

        The prisoner was allowed to make a petition explaining his actions, wherein was a
            Disclosure of all the Knavery and Juggling of the Attorney and Sollicitor, which had
            brought all this Law-stuff on purpose to blind the Eyes of his Excellency, and all the
            honourable Court there, going about to make them think, that those things which they all
            saw and perceived sensibly to be in very deed done, and actually performed, were nothing
            else but vain Illusions, Fancies, Dreams and Enchantments, and to be wrought and [34] compassed by the Means of a poor harmless Wretch, that never
            had heard of such great Matters in all his Life: Whereas the very Fault was in the
            Negligence of the Prince’s Council, Lords and Officers of his State, that had the Rule
            of the Roast, and by whose Advice the Commonwealth was so soundly mis-governed.
          He makes irrefutable countercharges against the grandees. But the Prince
            and States-men (being pinched on both sides, by both the Parties) were not a little
            offended at the great Liberty that they had taken, in censuring so far of His Highness’s
            Government; and thereupon the Prisoner was freed and pardoned, the Attorney, Sollicitor,
            Master of Requests, and those that were acquainted with the Draught of the Petition,
            were all of them commanded to the Tower; so the Lieutenant took charge of them. And this
            was the End of our Law-sports, concerning the Night of Errors.

        When we were wearied with mocking thus at our own
            Follies, at length there was a great Consultation had for the Recovery of our lost
            Honour. Plans are made to perform divers plots and devices on 3 Jan., with
          provisions made to keep out gate crashers and otherwise to ensure order.

        How to understand these events? On 28 Dec. a notable Performance was made
          impossible because worshipful Personages and Gentlewomen
          invaded the specially erected stage to such a degree that there was no convenient
            room for those that were Actors; the Templarian guests took offense and
          departed; order was mostly restored, and dancing and reveling, followed by a performance
          of The Comedy of Errors, were substituted, substitutions that
          were not . . . any thing of Account in comparison to what had been
          planned. The Actors seem not to be the same as the Players,
          later called a Company of base and common Fellows, though it is just
          possible that the notable Performance was The Comedy of
            Errors, not substituted but merely delayed until the rather small stage could be
          cleared for performance (Smith [1997, p. 102]: The first recorded
            performance . . . almost didn’t happen). The embarrassment caused by the near
          riot led to the events of the succeeding days.

        Is Gesta Grayorum an eyewitness report of an event that went
          badly wrong, leading to ad hoc substitutions of wholly different, planned entertainments,
          followed the next day by a hastily convened arraignment and trial of someone who was to
          blame for not controlling the evening better and for having, without planning, assembled
          the Lord Chamberlain’s men, well after 9 p.m., to play Err. on
          what was perhaps an unfamiliar stage with no opportunity for familiarizing themselves with
          the physical attributes of that stage? Or is the whole account a fiction, one that
          pretends there was such mismanagement and such good fortune, followed by a mock
          arraignment and freeing of the prisoner? No one has put Gesta
            Grayorum under much scrutiny, though Quiller-Couch (in Wilson, ed. 1922, p. x) doubts that its
          account is trustworthy: We doubt then that it [the ad hoc substitution of Err.] was a makeshift: we suspect rather that it was pre-arranged;
            that the players had been pre-empted from Greenwich to present just such an extravaganza
            upon Plautus as would tickle the scholarly taste and amuse the serious
              lawyers amid their bowers. The reference to Greenwich alludes to a
          probably mistaken report of payment to the Chamberlain’s men for a performance at court on
          28 Dec. 1594; see . Bland (ed. 1968, Gesta Grayorum, p. xiii n.), denying Hotson (1954, p. 50), who supposes
          the interruption and its consequences were planned: This was certainly not the case
            here, whatever may have happened on other occasions. The record leaves no doubt that the
            disorders were quite unexpected.
          Dorsch (ed. 1988,
          p. 28) believes the Actors were members of Gray’s Inn, and the
            Players were the Chamberlain’s men, who had been purposely engaged for
          this performance on a stage with which they might well have been
            acquainted.
          Hurley (1996, pp.
          103 ff.) studies the role of interruption in court and festive rituals,
          specifically in the plays and entertainments at the Inns of Court, whose purpose was to
          help students learn how (p. 112) to adjust to disruptions occasioned by collisions
            of status and power, a regular feature of late Renaissance court life. Noting
          Hotson and Gesta Grayorum (ed. Bland), p. 114: I suspect
            that the truth lies somewhere between the arranged and the completely
            spontaneous. . . . Specific interruptions might indeed arise spontaneously, but the
            patterns they assumed [115] were derived from previously existing
            social arrangements they then both reflected and modified.
          Smith (1997, pp.
          103, 108, 118): Reinserted into the social context in which it was given
            its first recorded performance, The Comedy of Errors offers
            itself as a particularly revealing document about what it meant to be male—for one
            privileged group of men, at least—in early modern England. . . . 

        [108] Whether or not The Comedy
              of Errors was written specifically for performance at Gray’s Inn has been the
            subject of philological inquiry for some time. From the standpoint of cultural
            anthropology, however, it doesn’t really matter which is the chicken and which the egg.
            More important is the fact that The Comedy of Errors and the
              Gesta Grayorum that occasioned its first recorded performance
            constitute . . . a single piece of social process. He studies the two documents
          to show them as describing a rite of passage involving such matters as adolescent
          anxieties about identity, the emphasis in both on sexuality, and adult assurances,
          including (p. 118) in the end, both play and pageants find a place for women that
            supports rather than threatens male identity.
          Kinney (1999, pp.
          321, 323), commenting on Gesta Grayorum: This passage
            [quoted from pp. 31–2 above] has long been interpreted as a factual account . . . ; but
            there is at least another reading possible: that Confusion was the theme and the whole
            evening performed as planned. He suggests that the play is (p. 323)
            itself a mixture of the pagan and the Christian. And this is true, in turn,
            because it comes out of a profoundly unsettled cultural moment, the time of
          transition between abandoning Catholicism, when the mystery plays continued to be
          performed in the face of official opposition, and embracing a secular worldview, as
          evidenced in the secular drama.

        The first suspicious element is the one just alluded to, getting an acting company
          assembled late at night on the spur of the moment. How would the actors have been rounded
          up? They had probably played in the afternoon on the public stage, if not in fact at
          Greenwich, and had played at court the two preceding nights as well; they would be tired
          and dispersed. Supposing they were assembled, could they perform Err. on an unfamiliar stage, by all estimates an odd one (see Staging) erected
          near the middle of Gray’s Inn hall? The difficult scenes to stage, of E. Antipholus locked
          out and the exiting and reentrance of S. Antipholus, S. Dromio, and the Abbess in Act 5,
          would call for some familiarity with that stage. Next, the vocabulary used to account for
          the mishaps—Sorceries and Inchantments . . . Witchcraft . . . Sorcerer or
            Conjuror—closely mirrors that of Err., as does the
          surprising coincidence of being pinched on both sides with its possible
          glance at Doctor Pinch. If Err. influences Gesta—and no one knows how long after Shrovetide 1595 the latter was
          written—could a single performance have had such an effect on the writer? (Of course, he
          might have seen Err. later, as often as it was played.) Were the
          Gray’s Inn members as humiliated by the disgraceful goings on as they say? Did they cover
          that embarrassment by quickly setting up a court to interrogate the Sorcerer? Had they not
          planned anything for 29 Dec.? Did they really decide after that trial to have a next grand
          night on 3 Jan., when an elaborate masque was presented (see )? Such performances take great planning. Granted that the report
          sounds authentic as it describes the Night of Errors and its immediate consequences, it
          does not square with the extremely elaborate, very expensive planning that the first words
          of Gesta Grayorum (ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 5–6) describe: The great number of gallant Gentlemen that Grays-Inn
            afforded at ordinary Revels, betwixt All-hollontide [1 Nov.] and
              Christmas, exceeding therein the rest of the Houses of Court,
            gave occasion to some Well-willers of our Sports . . . to wish an Head answerable to so
            noble a Body, and a Leader to so gallant a Company: Which Motion was more willingly
            hearkened unto, in regard that such Pass-times had been intermitted by the space of
            three or four Years, by reason of Sickness and Discontinuances.

        [6] After many Consultations had hereupon, by the
            Youths, and others that were most forward herein, at length, about the 12th of December . . . it was determined, that there should be elected a
            Prince of Purpoole, to govern our State for the time; which was
            intended to be for the Credit of Grays Inn, and rather to be
            performed by witty Inventions, than chargeable Expences. But the expenses were
          high, causing a levy on the members (and getting ten pounds from an alumnus, Lord
          Treasurer William Cecil).

        An alternative is to say this was all scripted, including a near riot that did not occur,
          a display of Templarian anger that never happened, and a planned performance of Err. to an audience so suitable for it that many have proposed that
          the play was written for Gray’s Inn (though not necessarily for these revels, which seem
          to have been determined on only some two weeks before it was played). There is some allure
          to the notion that Sh. wrote the play especially for these revels, for then the appearance
          of the Chamberlain’s men is most easily accounted for. Thomas (1956, pp. 380–1) makes the
          most closely reasoned case for such an occasional composition (see ), though like others who argue that Err.
          was written for Gray’s, he does not mention the apparently impromptu nature of the events
          recorded in Gesta Grayorum.

        The contemporary influence of Err. was sufficient to encourage
          the anonymous author of The Birth of Hercules, a version of
          Plautus’s Amphitruo, to include a witty servant named Dromio. The
          date of this manuscript play is uncertain, but on the basis of watermarks cannot be before
          1597 (ed. Bond, 1911, p. v). Bond goes on
          to say (pp. x f.), The Birth of Hercules is a pretty close
            adaptation, or even translation, of the Amphitruo . . . increased in bulk nearly one third by the addition of the
            second servant, Dromio [etc.] . . . additions probably suggested by the Comedy of Errors. Dromio is a second servant (with Sosia) of
          Amphitruo, sent by the returning master to tell Alcmena he is coming home, hence
          interrupting Jupiter’s night with her. Dromio has been delayed by a tempest that nearly
          wrecked his ship, another detail possibly suggested by Err.

        Foakes (ed. 1962,
          p. lii), who notes The Birth of Hercules, adds How a Man may choose a Good Wife from a Bad (1602): This comedy has
            among its characters a thin schoolmaster called Aminadab, who is described in terms that
            recall Antipholus’s depiction of Doctor Pinch [1714–18]. Quoted here differently from Foakes:
            When didst thou see the starueling School-maister? That Rat, that shrimp, that
            spindelshank, that Wren, that sheep-biter, that leane chittiface, that famine, that
            leane Enuy, that all bones, that bare Anatomy, that Iack a Lent,
            that ghost, that shadow, that Moone in the waine. . . . When next I finde him here Ile
            hang him vp | Like a dried Sawsedge, in the Chimnies top: | That Stock-fish, that poor
            Iohn, that gut of man (E1v, Tudor Facsimile Texts,
          ed. J. S. Farmer, 1912). The rhythms and vocabulary of 1H4 appear
          as well. See n. 0 for early possible
          references to the term comedy of errors.
        

        1602John Manningham records in his diary that he had seen TN in Feb. 1602 at the Middle Temple: wee had a play
            called . . . Twelue night or what you will. much like the commedy of errors or Menechmi in plautus (in Lothian &amp; Craik, ed. TN, 1975, p. xxvi). His
          language suggests that Err. continued to be seen.

          the (now) King’s company was having trouble finding suitable entertainment for the usual

        1670s?Smock Alley, Dublin. On internal evidence Evans (1996, pp. 19, 75) dates this
          prompt-book before the end of the century, but he does not believe this version was ever
          produced because one rearrangement brings S. Dromio onstage at 861 with E. Antipholis, to whom Dromio describes Nell’s
          appearance—to Nell’s employer. Bald (1941, pp. 376–7), dating the prompt-book sometime after 1700,
          first analyzes these Smock Alley prompt-books, but does so briefly, noting of Errors that Carkanet (622) is simplified to golden chain and that, for
          economy in casting, Angelo has absorbed Balthazar.
          Shattuck (1965, p.
          67) dates the prompt-book from the 1670s.

        ca. 1672?London; ?touring. Evans (1964) prints a facsimile of pages of
            F1 marked for performance, perhaps by the so-called Nursery company,
          whose function was to train actors, male and female, to take their places in the two
          Restoration companies, the King’s (Killigrew’s) and the Duke’s (Davenant’s). Evans (p. 6)
          allows the possibility that a provincial touring company, drawn from Nursery and King’s
          company players, might have used the prompt copy as late as 1672. Three actors, John Coysh
          (E. Dromio), Thomas Disney (S. Antipholus), and Sarah Cook (Adriana), were associated with
          Killigrew’s company at the time. Err. was assigned to the King’s
          company in 1668–9 when older plays were alloted to the new companies to help fill up their
          repertories (Nicoll, History, 1952, 1:354). No performance of
            Err. by that company is recorded, but it appears that the mixed
          company did play it because the parts have been cast in the margins. Van Lennep (London
            Stage, 1965, 1:186–7): It is possible that this is a cast for a Nursery
            production in [187] London, but it seems somewhat more likely
            that the cast represents a provincial touring company.
          Burner (1966)
          makes an even solider case for a provincial touring company; she gives evidence that such
          a company would have functioned in the 1670s.

        1694Douai, France. Evans (1962, p. 163) describes the Douai MS (7.87,
          Bibliothèque de Douai), transcripts of five Shn. plays apparently copied from
            F2 or, in the case of Err., a transcript of
            F2, possibly for performance at the English Roman Catholic college
          located there. The transcript has a title page, unique in the collection: The
            Famous Comedy of Errors | Written | by ye renowned poet Mr William | Shakespear. It may be evidence, unrecorded
          elsewhere, of continuing popularity in the 17th c.

          edition is Hull’s first version of what would be the form of Err.
          played into the next century, and while it adds a great deal to and cuts a great deal from
            Err., it held the stage for fifty years. Hogan reconstructs the
          cast (2:150–1): Edward Shuter (E. Dromio); John Dunstall (S. Dromio); Thomas Hull (S.
          Antipholis—he would soon begin his long career as Ægeon); Davis, stage name of Thomas
          Dibble (E. Antipholis); Elizabeth Vincent (Adriana); Jane Lessingham (Luciana); and Sarah

          Ægeon, W. T. (Gentleman) Lewis and John Whitfield played the two
          Antipholises, John Brunsdon and John Quick the Dromios, Ralph Wewitzer (Pinch), Jane
          Lessingham (renewing as Luciana after 17 years), Hester Jackson (Adriana), and Elizabeth
          Hartley (Abbess) (Hogan, 1952, 1:151). Odell (1920, 2:48): I wish to state that I believe an
            audience would get more enjoyment from Hull’s (and Kemble’s) Comedy of Errors than from
            Shakespeare’s, because Hull’s additions sentimentalized the play, added to the
          lines of S. Dromio, and allowed Ægeon and the Abbess to rejoice at their reunion.

        17806 Jan.; 16 May. Covent Garden, London. The cast is as in 1779,
          save that Mary Whitfield replaced Jane Lessingham.

        The play now began to appear regularly at Covent Garden, with performances—sometimes only
          once a year—in 1781, 1785, 1786, 1788–98.

        Lewis continued as S. Antipholis until he was replaced by William Macready in 1790–1,
          followed by Alexander Pope. E. Antipholis was played by John Whitfield, William Palmer,
          and John Bernard before Joseph Holman took over the role in 1793. Elizabeth Inchbald was
          the Abbess from 1785 to 1789, when Charlotte Chapman replaced her.

        179315 Apr.; 3, 5 June; 8, 26 Oct. Covent Garden, London. The
          performances of the 1790s (yearly from 1793 to 1798) had Alexander Pope and Joseph Holman
          as the Antipholises, the very popular Joseph Munden and John Quick as the Dromios, and
          Hull as Ægeon. Isabella Mattocks played Adriana (also Celia, Cordelia, Hermione, Jessica,
          suggesting an attractive Adriana).

        These Covent Garden performances used Hull’s revised and enlarged text (A New
            Edition, as the title page says); his ed. would be the standard text until
          Inchbald-Kemble’s in 1808, which made very few changes.

        180425 May. Park, New York. Err. was first
          played in New York as an after-piece. Odell (1927–49, 3:229) perhaps mistranscribes Ægeon as Ægeus;
          the Courtesan/Lesbia is chastely named Hostess. It is hard to guess what
          version this represents, but probably Hull’s.

        18089 Jan. Covent Garden, London. Charles Kemble as E. Antipholis,
          Charles Murray took over Ægeon following the death of Hull, and William Munden began his
          S. Dromio role (Genest, 1832, 8:85). This was a revival by J. P. Kemble after he left
          Drury Lane; the version he used, Hull’s very slightly modified, was probably the one
          published in 1808 by Inchbald; she, however, almost certainly had no hand in the text but
          instead contributed Remarks, as the title page says.

        181117 Apr. Covent Garden, London. Mr. Jones as S. Antipholis, John
          Brunton as E. Antipholis, Munden as S. Dromio, William Blanchard as E. Dromio. Genest (1832, 8:233):
            Munden acted very well, but he was considerably shorter than Blanchard, and could
            not well be mistaken for him. Jones and Brunton were well suited.

        18233 Oct. Covent Garden, London. Genest (1832, 9:247): With
            Katherine and Petruchio [i.e., Garrick’s Shr.], that
          is, as an after-piece, but it is impossible to say what version of Err. was used.

        182625 Oct. Park, New York. James Henry Hackett (E. Dromio); John
          Barnes (S. Dromio); Lee (S. Antipholis); John Woodhull (E. Antipholis); Mrs. Hackett
          (Adriana). Barnes and Hackett played the roles for over a decade. Hackett’s specialty was
          mimicking other actors, and he made his imitation of Barnes the centerpiece of the
          performances. Odell (1927–49, 3:299) wonders whether Hackett ever acted rather than
          mimicked. The performance was as adapted to dramatic representation, and performed
            at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden; Odell (3:236) thinks this refers to some
          version of Reynolds’s 1819 opera, but it is very difficult to know just what was being
          performed. In any event, the revival was so popular that Hackett delayed his planned trip
          to England. He later became a famous Falstaff.

        184326 July. Bowery, New York. W. H. Vache (sometimes
            Vaché) played E. Dromio to E. L. Davenport’s S. Dromio. This pair
          continued in these roles for several years.

        184523 Sept. Niblo’s, New York. Thomas Placide (E. Dromio); Henry
          Placide (S. Dromio). They played this Err. for nearly 20 years.
          Their prompt-book is analyzed below.

        18513 Mar. Bowery, New York. Kate Denin played E. Antipholus to her
          sister Susan’s S. Antipholus.

        185315 Dec. Burton’s, New York. William Burton (S. Dromio); Andrews
          (E. Dromio).

        185418 Apr. Burton’s, New York. Harry Hall (E. Dromio); George
          Jordan played S. Antipholis to Charles Fisher’s E. Antipholis, a pairing that lasted
          several years.

        18558 Nov. Sadler’s Wells, London. Samuel Phelps replaced the
          Hull-Kemble version and the Reynolds opera (see below) with the authentic play.

        185721 Jan. Niblo’s, New York. Lizzy Davenport (S. Antipholus) and
          Olive Logan (E. Antipholus) in one of the Placide brothers productions.

        186427 Feb. Princess’s Theatre, London. The director, George Vining,
          played S. Antipholus, and Henry Webb played E. Dromio to his identical twin, Charles’s, S.
          Dromio. This production transferred to Stratford-upon-Avon in April. Kemp &amp; Trewin (1953, p. 50): Henry and Charles Webb appeared as the
            peas-in-a-pod Dromios. They acted the play continuously, without fall of
            the curtain (Child, in Wilson ed. 1922, p. 119).

        18643 Oct. Winter Garden, New York. This is the Kemble version,
          since the merchants are named Cleon and Chares; Bridget (Luce-Nell) was played by Mr.
          Post; Owen Fawcett played E. Dromio. J. S. Clarke (S. Dromio) began his long career in
          comedy.

        187825 Nov. Park, New York. Here began the careers of Stuart Robson
          and W. H. Crane as the Dromios. Robson employed what Odell (1927–49, 10:599) calls the
            vocal squeaks of the unchanging Robson, which Crane was to imitate for a
          decade.

        188226 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon. Edward Compton, director and E.
          Dromio, William Calvert (E. Antipholus).

        18857 Sept. Star, New York. W. H. Crane &amp; Stuart Robson in a new
          production by Alfred Thompson which had uncommon scenic display, much
          admired at the time. New York Times (8 Sept. 1885, p. 5):
            To refer by their titles even to all the elaborate sets that delighted the
            eye . . . would demand more space than can be just now afforded the subject. Among a
            dozen pictures four, i.e.
            Odeum of Ephesus,
            Phryne’s Palace,
            The Port of Ephesus and the Melancholy Vale, may be cited
            as notably elaborate and beautiful.
          Trewin (1978, p.
          45): The comedy vanished in a pageant of the priests and priestesses of Diana of
            the Ephesians, with vestals and acolytes, Ionian flautists, Egyptian harpers, curators
            of the temple, heralds, and Praetorian guards. As for the villa of the courtesan
            Phryne . . . this was a place of tinted marble columns, of embroidered and spangled
            lace, lamps of perfumed oil, genuine Negroes . . . , palms, brilliant flowers,
            sumptuous couches, singing slaves, and Bacchantes.

        18956 Dec. Gray’s Inn hall. Elizabethan Stage Society directed by
          William Poel, who costumed the cast in authentic late Elizabethan dress as part of his
          program to recapture the original 16th-c. acting and staging values. Speaight (1954, p. 110, with
          photographs): The Benchers and their guests sat at their usual places at the long
            tables, and the actors appeared through the Tudor doors at the lower end of the hall and
            played on the same level as their audience. The play was given without an
            interval.

        18998 June. Terry’s, London. Leon Quartermaine (S. Antipholus); Ben
          Greet played both Dromios, the earliest example of doubling I have found.

        In the 20th c., Err. gets sporadic performance in England and
          the United States. I mention those that attracted attention in print or had notable
          performers.

        190410 Dec. Terry’s, London. Directed by William Poel, with Nugent
          Monck as Pinch. Poel influenced Monck, who produced Err. in
          1919.

        190525 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon. Kemp &amp; Trewin (1953, p. 69): F[rank] R. Benson knew how to treat the skein
            of cross-questions and crooked answers; the players, knotting and unravelling their plot
            at high speed (Percy Owen and F. R. B. as the Antipholuses, Whitby and Weir as the
            Dromios) seemed to enjoy their labours as much as the audience enjoyed watching
            them. Benson took this production to the Adelphi, London, in July for 15
          performances.

        191430 Nov. Old Vic, London. Sybil Thorndike (Adriana). Ben Greet,
          who produced the play, persuaded Sybil Thorndike to join the Old Vic company (Trewin, 1964, p.
          73).

        191629 July Stratford-upon-Avon. Ben Greet brought his Old Vic
          production to Stratford. Times (London) (31 July, p. 9):
            Miss Sybil Thorndike . . . gave promise of excellent work in more important
            characters.

        1919Nov. or Dec. Maddermarket, Norwich. Nugent Monck directed, as
          part of his effort to produce all the plays at his replica of an Elizabethan stage (Hildy, 1986, p.
          [181]).

        192217 Apr. Old Vic, London. Farjeon (1949, p. 28): Mr
            [Robert] Atkins [the producer] seriously constricted the geography of Ephesus by
            providing a delightful set, showing the house of Antipholus on one side and the Priory
            on the other. This set proving too elaborate to be speedily moved, we found the two
            Dromios executing their errands on the very spot from which they were
            dispatched.

        19241 Sept. Savoy, London. Eric Portman (S. Antipholus). The Dromios
          were in blackface; Farjeon (1949, p. 29) objected sharply that Sh. would have let such a
          feature be known had he intended it.

        193812 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon. Theodore Komisarjevsky, director
          and designer. Kemp &amp;
              Trewin (1953, pp. 185–6): It had
            operatic and balletic touches and the fun marched merrily to Handel’s music. . . . The
            little town square . . . was the local habitation of urban folly in any country. The
            little painted houses, the representative townfolk, and the everyday [186] traffic in the square flashed in the sunshine. The costumes were of no
            single place or period but combined many styles in an astonishing variety of bright
            colours. The men wore plumes in their pink bowler hats: the women flirted in
            farthingales and carried modern handbags: the officers of the Watch wore comic opera
            uniforms. . . . The fanciful façade of Ephesus suggested a perpetual holiday haunt
            where days are given up to fantasy and nights to masquerade. . . . 

        The townsmen frisked on their everyday occasions, for Handel was
            pacemaker here. The music was among the major pleasures of the production. There was
            song and dance, ballad and ballet. Eminent Ephesians threw a leg and lined-up for a
            Handelian glee. Anthony Bernard composed the songs, using music by Handel,
          Mozart, and Toëschi (Gooch, Thatcher, et. al., 1991, 1:193
          #2031).

        Kennedy (1993,
          pp. 131–2) calls Komisarjevsky’s Err.
          a play ripe in 1938 for illustrative transformation. It got a treatment worthy of a
            great visual director, integrating the styles of the fairytale and commedia. . . . The toy-like set, with its
            skewed perspective and unsettling [132] combination of
            three-dimensional units with flat houses, carried the production into that area of farce
            where real human problems are indistinguishable from supercharged
          absurdities.

        195723 Apr. Old Vic, London. Double bill with Tit., both directed by Walter Hudd from texts shortened by John Barton. Keith
          Michell (E. Antipholus), John Humphrey (S. Antipholus), Dudley Jones (E. Dromio), John
          Fraser (S. Dromio), Barbara Jefford (Courtezan), Margaret Whiting (Adriana), and Robert
          Helpmann (Pinch). Adriana was played as a shrew, though Margaret Whiting was nearly
          inaudible. Clarke
          (1957, unpaged): The two plays were presented . . . in a single setting,
            by Paul Mayo, of rough lathes and woodwork designed to give an initial impression of an
            Elizabethan inn. A strolling company of players—perhaps Lord Pembroke’s men forced out
            of London . . . during a time of plague—arrived at this inn and in the course of the
            evening presented two plays; first the tragedy and then, after an intermission, the
            comedy. . . . 

        
          The costumes, as was customary in the Elizabethan theatre, were
              contemporary, that is, of the same period as the plays, late
            sixteenth-century. . . . 
        

        
          The Antipholi were got up in identical costumes of striped pink velvet and
            the Dromios were tubby little coloured boys with blue trousers and bright red
            caps. . . . 
        

        
          Weighed down by an enormous magic book, tripping over his straggly beard
            (perhaps composed of five hairs something like eight feet long), peering upwards from
            beneath eyebrows like some fantastic butterfly, toothlessly mouthing and mumbling, he
            [Helpmann] . . . showed once again that in wordless comedy he has no peer, or equal, on
            the English stage. The audience by the time of his exit was limp with laughter.
        

        Barbara Jefford’s over-aspirated delivery of My way is now to hie
            home to his house was much noticed (she played Tamora as well).

        Times (London) (24 Apr., p. 3a) called the performance of Err.
          a cheap collapse.

        196211 Sept. Stratford-upon-Avon. Alec McCowen
          (S. Antipholus), Ian Richardson (E. Antipholus), Ian Hewitson (E. Dromio), Barry MacGregor
          (S. Dromio), James Booth (Pinch), Tony Church (Egeon), Pauline Letts (Aemilia), Diana Rigg
          (Adriana), Susan Maryott (Luciana). Trewin (1962, p. 517): Paul Scofield’s Lear had to be postponed owing to Scofield’s exhaustion. At
            short notice, The Comedy of Errors took its place on September
            11. . . . The new director, Mr. Clifford Williams, was less capricious [than
            Komisarjevsky], even if some of us were alarmed at first by what seemed to be a stern
            invitation to the dance: a portentous and needless mime. Then cheerfulness broke in: the
            occasion became a blend of Mr. Williams and the livelier commedia dell’ arte, Shakespeare intervening. The night
            depended most surely upon the brothers Antipholus, the mild Ephesian and the fussy
            traveler from Syracuse. [McCowen and Richardson] were plausibly twins. Mr. McCowen
            presented a blandly sententious young man who, on being offered a wife, a house, a gold
            chain, and a few other bounties, looked precisely like a cat about to sneeze. . . . Mr.
            Richardson . . . was a gentle, worried spaniel, at first beseechingly mild, then
            pricked suddenly to a wrath that reminded us that he had taken deep scars in the Duke’s
            war. Not a man to be toyed with unwisely. Did he not gnaw with my teeth my bones
              in sunder [1726: bonds; he gnawed Dromio’s as
            well].

        
          Few directors can ease the burden of the Dromio twins: Mr. Ian Hewitson
            and Mr. Barry MacGregor did what high spirits could. . . . 
        

        
          Shakespeare’s voice sounds most assuredly in the Syracusan merchant. With
            that improbable early narrative—so out of key with the rest—a good actor can move us,
            and Mr. Tony Church, unmistakably a good actor, did so at Stratford: he was aided in the
            final scene by the sympathetic Abbess of Miss Pauline Letts.
        

        Styan (1977, p.
          211) copies from the prompt-book the choreographed, highly symmetrical movements at the
          beginning of the play and the final exit of the Dromios: In retrospect there was
            nothing particularly sophisticated about this choreography in itself, but for a comedy
            of improbable coincidences it made an irresistible visual assertion that ritual and
            convention had gripped the stage.

        Of this production, Leiter (1986, p. 68) says: The historical significance
            of this production . . . cannot be overemphasized, since it signalled the emergence of
            the style of Shakespearean production characteristic of the Peter Hall years at
            Stratford: Kenneth Tynan observed that this style could be recognized by solid
              Brechtian settings that emphasise wood and metal instead of paint and canvas; and by
              cogent, deliberate verse-speaking that discards melodic cadenzas in favour of meaning
              and motivation.

        
          Other notable productions of the period followed Williams’ basic strategy
            of precisely rehearsed comedy in the commedia tradition.
        

        This production moved to the Aldwych, London, for the Christmas season.

        196314 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon. Donald Sinden (Duke Solinus),
          Clifford Rose (E. Dromio), John Walsh (Aegeon), Janet Suzman (Luciana), Susan Engel
          (Courtezan), Madoline Thomas (Aemilia). Times (London) (16 Apr.,
          p. 15a): The 1962 production has mellowed with success, and has lost the
            original ingredient of anxiety and inward restlessness. Some of the characters now seem
            aware that there is no problem in this business of mistaken identity, that it is
            moonshine.

        
          Two new members of the cast, Mr. Donald Sinden as the Duke and Mr. John
            Walsh as the father of the Antipholuses, certainly suggested this. Since theirs is the
            first scene, if we overlook the parade of the whole company followed by the
              ballet of figures from some picture of eighteenth-century Venice, the
            tone set by the Duke and Aegeon is important to the whole. Their scene lacked tension
            and appeared long drawn out. . . . 
        

        
          The fun and the reality now derived chiefly from the resemblance between
            the Antipholuses in attitude and temper of mind. Neither knew that he had a double
            possessing the same mixture of deep-seated complacency and superficial excitability, but
            we knew it. Soon the mere entrance of one twin was enough to conjure up the thought of
            the other and in fact absent twin. Mr. Rose by making Dromio of Ephesus the simpler,
            slower witted of the two servants added something new to the setup. Mr. MacGregor has
            developed Dromio of Syracuse into a man for all seasons where farce is
            concerned.
        

        
          Both the new Luciana (Miss Janet Suzman) and the new Courtezan (Miss Susan
            Engel) seemed unsure of themselves, but the new Abbess (Miss Madoline Thomas) gave
            valuable weight to the ending. She brought out, as Miss Diana Rigg as Adriana continues
            to do, both the reality of the character and the aspect of farce that it is compelled by
            the situation to present. But on the whole there is too little of the first element in
            this year’s revival.
        

        196420 May. Lincoln Center, New York. Julie Christie (Luciana),
          Elizabeth Spriggs (Courtezan), Michael Williams (Pinch). New York
            Times (21 May, p. 43): The only aim of the British troupe [of
            the 1962 and 1963 productions] is to distill laughter from the innocent japes of this
            green work of Shakespeare’s, and . . . there is an abundance of boisterous, farcical
            spirits. . . . 

        
          For a brief time they go through the paces of the silly plot with its
            mixed identities as if they believed every word of the cheerfully turned, self-important
            couplets. But presently Clifford Williams’s staging starts to caper and to make a merry
            mockery of the mounting, idiotic confusions. Elegance of style shades into rowdy
            slapstick and boisterous horseplay. . . . 
        

        
          [Yet e]ven when they descend to wild, swift sight gags, they remember that
            the cream of the jest is best savored if the story is not utterly curdled.
        

        
          Thus when Ian Richardson as Antipholus of Ephesus must explain everything
            at the end to a just, though bewildered Duke, he does so with the exasperation of a man
            outrageously aggrieved. He is all the funnier for being in earnest.
        

        
          Alec McCowen as Antipholus of Syracuse accepts the favors of the striking
            Diana Rigg as Adriana, the other Antipholus’s wife, with the dubious air of a man who
            knows that in the real world such generosities rarely are thrust upon a
            stranger. . . . 
        

        Julie Christie as Adriana’s lovely sister is pained when she is
          made love to. Yet she cannot quite suppress the sigh of pleasure that such
            ardor must bring to a vulnerable heart.

        
          During the first half of the play, though the characters and actions are
            childish, the spirit is not hopelessly remote from plausibility. . . . 
        

        
          In the second half, however, Mr. Williams lets himself go. When Antipholus
            of Ephesus and his Dromio are to be sent to gaol . . . they are roped together, and
            fall, like a single log, into the waiting hands of four gaolers. . . . Michael Williams
            as Pinch the conjuror speaks with a sibilance that ends in a blast like a steam
            whistle’s, and he resorts to a crescendo of ludicrous spells and
            incantations. . . . 
        

        
          When Miss Rigg cries, she goes boo-hoo. Not a frantic boo-hoo, you
            understand, but an unmistakable wail all the same. The kind to make you chuckle and
            laugh, which is the sole business of this lark by the young Shakespeare.
        

        19758 Aug. Delacourt, Central Park, New York. John Pasquin’s
          production for Joseph Papp. Ted Danson played a bodyguard, Danny DiVito was Balthazar,
          Linda Lavin the Courtesan. Sometimes the critics detest what audiences love. Mel Gussow
            (New York Times, 17 Aug., p. 97): The fat maid teetering
            on a terrace of Santo Loquasto’s cuckoo-clock of a revolving set feverishly twirls a
            large round piece of fabric over her head until it completely envelops her. Is this
            meant to be a pizza the size of a tablecloth or a tablecloth shaped like a
            pizza? . . . The sight gag gets an easy laugh—that time and every time it is re-introduced. . . . This is a low-comedy, broken-Italian
            version. . . . Eggplants and zucchini are thrown like hand grenades. Steaming hot
            barber towels are dropped down the front of men’s trousers. Barn-size bloomers are
            exhibited like battle trophies. The Duke of Ephesus is a broad-bellied Mafioso in a
            white suit and pencil moustache and his bodyguard is a pistol-toting gangster (the
            production must set some sort of New York Shakespeare Festival record for gunfire). The
            carabiniere looks like Mussolini (this Comedy takes place in the thirties
              in a small Italian village). The dialogue is heavily spiced not just
            with scuse and che cosa? but with dissa and
              datta. And how many jokes can you make about flatulence? . . . But on
            the night I attended the audience seemed to love it.

        197621 Sept. Stratford-upon-Avon, RSC. Roger Rees (S. Antipholus),
          Mike Gwilym (E. Antipholus), Judi Dench (Adriana), Brian Coburn (Duke Solinus), Michael
          Williams (S. Dromio), Nickolas Grace (E. Dromio), Richard Griffiths (Officer), Robin Ellis
          (Pinch), Francesca Annis (Luciana). Guy Woolfenden, music. Trevor Nunn, lyrics (derived
          from lines in the play) and director. Irving Wardle (Times
          [London], 30 Sept., pp. 12–13): Trevor Nunn moves from the balletic
            economy of Clifford Williams’s version to the opposite extreme of lavish ornamentation,
            not to mention reworking the piece as a musical.

        
          Ephesus, as staged by John Napier and Dermot Hayes, is a fun-city bursting
            with novelty shops and tourist traps, swarming with gloved mobsters and amiable
            thigh-flashing tarts, and under the thumb of a hulking ducal dictator . . . who first
            waddles on under a load of military fruit salad to deliver his judgment on Aegeon over
            the public address system.
        

        
          All this represents no particular time or place, but it is certainly the
            domain of comedy; and comedy of a kind that expands naturally into music. As with the
            RSC’s previous excursions into popular music, Guy Woolfenden’s score knows its place. It
            does not give you much to hum on the way out, but it supplies an admirable springboard
            into dramatic song and dance. The lyrics, mainly built from turning points in the plot,
            have the effect of further translating the story into fairy tale.
        

        
          The sentence on Aegeon is worked up into a chorus number that turns his
            predicament into a game. Likewise, Antipholus’s proposition to the indignant Luciana (a
            spinsterly bespectacled Francesca Annis) changes into a playful duet.
        

        
          By such means the whole show ascends into comic fantasy. Antipholus,
            locked out of his house, conducts an enraged debate over the intercom which he finally
            pulls away from the wall. The culminating hue and cry starts during a western and takes
            place to the sound of gunshot and thundering hooves. Also, there are delicious added
            details such as Richard Griffiths’s officer, a glum stooge dragged around after his
            captive and making a dejected ceremonial appearance in Greek army tutu and long
            combinations. . . . 
        

        
          We are unlikely ever to see a funnier Adriana than Judi Dench, a
            peremptory odalisque downing her terrified servants with flying trays and point-blank
            bursts from the soda syphon and relapsing into voluptuous submission with her supposed
            husband.
        

        
          The two Antipholuses get finally [sic: finely?] contrasted and physically
            close casting from Roger Rees (wearing his camera even into the bedroom) and Mike
            Gwilym, a sharp gum-chewing resident who fits precisely the Las Vegas-like setting.
            Michael Williams and Nickolas Grace dispatch two carrot-haired, baggy-jeaned Dromios
            with balletic clowning. And Robin Ellis’s Dr Pinch goes off nicely in a puff of
            smoke.
        

        Scott (1982, pp.
          14–16) approvingly analyzes some of the interpolated songs, drawing on the prompt copy in
          the Shakespeare Centre Library at Stratford-upon-Avon. E.g., (p. 15): Adriana
            taking refuge in Campari and soda, and the bespectacled Luciana attractively peering
            around her book at the play’s action, were given a lengthy, amusing duet and dance
            routine concerning A man is master of his liberty.

        The setting, presumably a Greek resort town, was uncertain enough to make one reviewer
          (Ned Chaillet, Times [London] 15 Nov., p. 17) call it an
            Italian village square bedecked with trinkets and tourist goods and another,
          reviewing the previous year’s Stratford-upon-Avon production: A contemporary
            Turkish market where garments hang from the balconies, the Porpentine and the
          Tiger are bars, and Aegeon [is] clearly in the rag trade (Roger Warren,
            ShS 30 [1977], p. 176).

        Nunn’s production seems to have been the first in which Adriana takes S. Antipholus to
          bed, raising pretty serious problems about how he and Luciana are to behave thereafter.
          Reviewers, however, hardly even mention the seduction, and none reports how the aftermath
          was handled. In the 1980 San Diego National Shakespeare Festival production, Adriana
          started out as a dowdy housewife opposite a sexy, knowing Luciana who instructed her how
          to improve her appearance. She did so, and entered Act 5 visibly pregnant, fainting when
          she saw that there were two Antipholuses. See n. 607–14.

        198312 Feb. Goodman Theater, Chicago. Mel Gussow (New York Times, 13 Feb., pp. 56–7): As virtuosi of the New
            Vaudeville, the Flying Karamazov Brothers—a team of unrelated young American
            zanies—juggle everything from tenpins to telephones, from pussycats to pepperoni
            pizza. . . . 

        
          The evening begins with Avner Eisenberg . . . a sad-faced clown and not a
            Karamazov. He sweeps the stage and lifts a trapdoor to dispose of the litter. Then the
            trapdoor reopens and out pops an agitated William Shakespeare (Timothy Daniel Furst, the
              si­[57]lent Karamazov): One might say that Shakespeare has
            just been trashed. . . . 
        

        
          The other Karamazovs play the twins . . . and it is difficult to tell one
            Antipholus from the other. Howard Jay Patterson and Paul Magid are both long-whiskered
            Cossacks quick with a retort. Their Dromios (Samuel Ross Williams and Randy Nelson) look
            different but their comedy is equally demented. More than his partners, Mr. Nelson has a
            linguistic ability that is within the reach of Shakespeare.
        

        
          They toss the plot up in the air as if it were a dish and then keep it
            spinning there. Jokes wander as far afield as Broadway (West Side Story) and Chicago politics (Mayor Jane Byrne). However, whenever
            possible, the company takes its cue for comedy from Shakespeare. A Dromio reference to
            football . . . is followed by a huddle, a game of touch and a cheer for old Notre
            Dame.
        

        19839 Aug. Stratford-upon-Avon, RSC. Henry Goodman and Richard
          O’Callaghan (Dromios), Zoe Wanamaker (Adriana), Paul Greenwood and Peter McEnery
          (Antipholuses). Adrian Noble directed. Ultz designed the costumes and makeup. All the
          actors had colored faces, usually white, but blue for the Antipholuses. The Dromios were
          in clown suits (baggy pants, oversize shoes, and big noses). The pit band marked every
          pratfall, collision, fart, and kiss with appropriate sounds. Luciana’s blond hair looked
          like an inverted ice cream cone. James Fenton (Sunday Times
          [London], 14 Aug., p. 35) admires Noble’s making the actors speak the verse
            pantomime style, with a blatant emphasis on simple rhythms and rhymes. This is some of
            the best verse-speaking we have had at Stratford in recent years. Anthony
          Masters (Times [London], 10 Aug., p. 11) regrets the unrelieved
          farce: The one element in the play which will never be there is the very real drama
            surrounding Adriana’s marriage with the Ephesian Antipholus, which is cracking up badly
            when his Syracusan twin brother blunders in. Husband’s back from lunch late and
            reluctantly after long business drinks, wife’s sister refusing marriage because she sees
            it in practice: there is plenty here a director could have used.

        199025 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon, RSC. Desmond Barrit (Antipholuses),
          Graham Turner (Dromios), Estelle Kohler (Adriana), Caroline Loncq (Luciana), David Waller
          (Aegeon), David Killick (Pinch). Stanley Wells (Times Literary
            Supp., 4–19 May, p. 474): Ian Judge’s production . . . is
            firmly grounded in David Waller’s serious delivery of the grief-stricken Aegeon’s
            opening narration, its comic potential acknowledged only as, warming to his task, he
            obligingly draws a diagram [of the arrangement of the family on the mast] to explain to
            the increasingly sympathetic Duke how he and his family succeeded in surviving
            shipwreck. This is affecting and true, but as soon as it is over we are thrust into a
            world of farcical stereotypes and mechanistic stylization which, accurately though it
            may reflect the dexterity of Shakespeare’s plotting, drains the play’s characters of
            even the limited reality with which Shakespeare has infused them. The Merchant becomes
            two nearly identical, strutting, bowler-hatted business men, one in green, the other in
            purple, carrying briefcases and umbrellas—these figure largely in the production—and
            sharing the character’s lines, sometimes speaking them in unison. Balthasar is a
            conventionally funny huntin’-and-shootin’ old buffer, Luciana a bespectacled frump first
            seen reading a copy of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, in violent contrast to Estelle Kohler’s
            wearisomely outrageous Adriana, prancing around in billowing veils and relentlessly
            burlesquing every line with exaggerated gestures, simpering leers, and camp
            intonation.

        
          This production style puts a premium upon cleverness. It takes its tone
            from the decision to have each pair of twins played almost throughout by a single actor.
            Their casting is unconventional. Antipholus (Desmond Barrit) is a fat, sleek-haired
            Latin type, actorishly skilful at milking lines for comic effect, more convincing in his
            flirtations with the audience than in his wooing of Luciana. Dromio . . . is usually
            thought of as a robust contrast to his more gentlemanly master, but Graham Turner, a
            natural mime with expressive features, is a slight figure, sweet-natured in his efforts
            to entertain and with a delicate touch of pathos in his put-upon
            resilience. . . . 
        

        
          The most original aspect of the production lies in its evocation of the
            Surrealist movement in, for example, the reproduction of Salvador Dalí’s couch modelled
            on Mae West’s lips on which Adriana and Luciana rise from below the stage on their first
            entry, and also in the symbolic devices hanging over the stage in Mark Thompson’s
            attractive, door-lined set. This is acceptable because there is something surrealistic
            in the confusions of this play, especially in its hints at supernatural forces at work
            in Ephesus. Less happy is the director’s use of traditions of popular entertainment.
            There is delicacy in the initial reminiscences of René Clair, Ibert and Chaplin, but
            before long we are in the world of Carry On films and television
            magic shows.
        

        
          Two especial traps for self-indulgent directors . . . are the Courtesan
            and Dr Pinch. Mr Judge falls into both. His Courtesan is a leering, hobble-skirted
            madam, drawing easy laughs as, tottering on high heels, she flails around with a
            besequinned handbag; and the Dr Pinch episode is drawn out interminably with Pinch as a
            tasteless caricature of Dali himself in the role of a conjurer (in the standard
            misinterpretation of Shakespeare’s use of the word) who causes Antipholus to disappear
            and Dromio to be sawn in half.
        

        
          The production reaches a climax of self-destructive vulgarity with the
            descent of a madonna surrounded by flashing neon lights to indicate the Priory from
            which the Abbess and her attendants emerge in parodic costumes. If at this late stage in
            the proceedings something Shakespearean emerges it is, first, because Cherry Morris as
            the Abbess, triumphing over her ludicrous get-up, gives a sense of emotional reality to
            her reunion with her long-lost husband, and second because, in the play’s delightful
            coda, with two Dromios at last on stage together, Shakespeare’s point that we depend for
            our sense of identity on the reactions of others is realized in the embarrassed joy with
            which Graham Turner’s Dromio finds not only his brother but himself.
        

        This production, which the critics hated, was extremely popular, and was taken on tour
          after its London performances.

        In addition to the actors mentioned in the preceding lists, the following have played S.
          Antipholus, seemingly as the more sympathetic role: Baliol Holloway, Old Vic, 1927; David
          Birney, Delacourt, New York, 1967; John Wood (to Corin Redgrave’s E. Antipholus), RSC,
          1972. Other Dromios include Charles Durning (E. Dromio), Delacourt, New York, 1967;
          Michael Flanders (S. Dromio), 1963 (audio disc Living Shakespeare
          SCE 45–46).

        Productions of Err. outside England and North America have
          appeared chiefly in the West. The first German production seems to have been an
          adaptation, one of four Shn. adaptations, played in Heidelberg in 1679 (Stahl, 1947, p. 30).
            Err. was played infrequently in the 18th and 19th c., but in
          the 20th c. performances increase. Hans Rothe’s version (1921), which strips the play of
          the romance plot, emphasizes Luce and gives her a low-comic cook Emmelina, was popular
          well into the late 20th c.; sometimes the romance plot is restored (Stahl, pp. 620–1; Gooch, Thatcher, et al. 1991, e.g., 1:210, #2185, 12 Dec. 1982).

        Milward (1997)
          mentions Japanese productions from 1951 to 1987. One, in 1980, in the words of its
          producer Tetsuo Anzai (p. 491), relied upon the style of the Commedia dell’Arte. We
            built a sham, play-within-a-play stage roofed with a tent upon the real stage of the
            hall; and all the action was done on this counterfeit stage . . . to induce a more
            willing suspension of disbelief by making the audience aware that everything is a play,
            so that we could pursue the intensity of the action to a greater extremity than possible
            otherwise. In Norio Deguchi’s production of 1987 the actors wore masks until the
          dénouement when all the errors were resolved (p. 493).

        Gooch, Thatcher, et al. (1991) list performances using incidental music in
          Santiago, Johannesburg, Limoges, Perth, Turin, Verona, Milan, Stockholm, Copenhagen,
          Aarhus, and several in Poland, the USSR, and Czechoslovakia clustered in the five years
          after World War Two, as well as later.

        No film of Err. has been made. In addition to The Boys from Syracuse and the Julian Slade BBC musical version noted above,
            Rothwell &amp; Melzer (1990, pp. 41–5) list and comment on several television
          productions including the Kraft Television Theatre, 7 Dec. 1949; the Clifford Williams
          production on 1 Jan. 1964, using the Stratford-upon-Avon cast filmed at the Aldwych
          Theatre, London (simulcast in the United States); the Trevor Nunn production, 1976,
          discussed above; and the Flying Karamazov Brothers’ 1983 production, filmed at Lincoln
          Center after moving to New York from Chicago.

        The most available of the television productions is a BBC version from 1984. Director:
          James Cellan-Jones, Cyril Cusack (Aegeon), Susanne Bertish (Adriana), Roger Daltrey (both
          Dromios), Charles Gray (Solinus), Wendy Hiller (Aemilia), and Joanne Pearce (Luciana).
            Rothwell &amp; Melzer (1990, p. 44): A main feature is the
              doubling of the principal characters, the Antipholuses and the Dromios,
            the latter being portrayed by rock star, Roger Daltrey. . . . The commedia dell arte style allows integration of
            mimes and street-players into the plot and mise en
              scène. Equally attention-getting is the huge map of the eastern
            Mediterranean that makes up the market floor and the marvellous lighting that gives the
            illusion of a sun-drenched Mediterranean seaport town.

        Locating the play, with some interest either in showing an Ephesus or, as
          is now more common, in devising a setting far removed from a historical locale, depends on
          the physical resources and aesthetics of the time. Err. requires
          no interior locations; it does require doors to be knocked on and entered and exited from.
          But over time conventional spaces have developed. With the establishment of movable
          scenery following the Restoration, the painted flats and drops follow the same pattern
          until the rise of elaborate fixed sets in the 1870s. Prompt-books and playbooks describe
          the scenery, even stipulating into which grooves the flats were to be placed. The play now
          requires a throne room, a street in the mart, a chamber in E. Antipholus’s house, and the
          exterior of the priory. For Hull’s version, there has to be a garden, and, under the
          influence of Reynolds’s staging, a chamber in the priory for the revised conclusion.
          Costumes apparently made little attempt to give a Near Eastern atmosphere. Daniel (ed. 1827)
          lists what is needed: DUKE.—Rich shape with long flowing arm-hole robe of blue
            velvet, white pantaloons, white shoes, hat and feathers . . . TWO ANTIPHOLISES.—Light
            blue shapes trimmed with yellow buttons, blue stockings, russet boots, cross belts,
            swords, hat and feathers . . . ADRIANA. Rich embroidered satin dress, with flowing
            crimson satin robe, jewels, &amp;c.

        By the end of the 19th c. elaborate scenery becomes popular. Photographs of the Crane and
          Robson production of 1885 noted above show decorative excess. The Duke, in oriental
          finery, sits on a raised throne with a canopy, guarded by soldiers in Roman armor
          (helmets, shields, chain armor). This opening scene features huge Corinthian columns and a
          view of Ephesus through a large bow window. The Abbess wears a Greek Orthodox–style habit.
          The Courtesan (Phryne) is borne in on a sedan chair carried by four bare-chested black
          youths. For Act 5, there are palm trees in the foreground, and Ephesus harbor in the
          background (The Illustrated American, 14 Oct. 1893).

        In recent times, beginning with Komisarjevsky’s famous Stratford-upon-Avon production
          (1938), the settings have taken on surprising qualities. Leiter (1986, p. 69): Hudd
            [Old Vic, 1957] and Treyz chose the environment of Elizabethan playhouses; Robin
            Phillips (1975) [Stratford, Ont.] found fun in the Canadian West of Conestoga
            wagons . . . ; John Ezell (Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, 1980) used a classical
            Mediterranean town; Arthur Storch employed seventeenth-century Florence; Gillette A.
            Elvgren, Jr. (Pittsburgh, 1981), evoked Turko-Hollywood-Roman . . . and
            Robert Woodruff [1983] went for a theatrical world suggestive of the circus. Aiming at
            an Ephesus where the strangest things could happen, Nagle Jackson in 1970 [Oregon Sh.
            Festival, Ashland] created a town with a flamboyant assortment of colorful, often
            bizarre, theatrical images. Modern dress also has been tried, as in John Bell’s
            Australian production of 1978, set in the clearly cosmopolitan city of
              Ephesus. . . . Trevor Nunn created a loosely defined modern setting that
            suggested anywhere from Turkey to Las Vegas. The 1920s were the background for Bill
            Cain’s 1980 Boston Shakespeare Company version: strobe lights, barbershop
              quartets, and costumes made of long-johns . . . tickled many funny bones.
            That same year Paul Barry’s New Jersey staging found the Mardi Gras in a 1920s New
            Orleans a congenial setting; a wild assortment of costumes was thus justified. Ben
            Levit’s 1978 Dallas production . . . successfully placed the play in a 1930s Neapolitan
            world. . . . In such modern dress productions the Duke was likely to be a garish
            dictator and the Syracusans foolish tourists.

        Err. has invited two staging opportunities that stand out, the
          doubling of one or both sets of twins by a single actor, and the perhaps surprising
          introduction of commedia dell’arte when the
          play makes no clear call for such staging.

        The first instance I can find of one actor’s playing both twins comes in 1899, when Ben
          Greet plays the Dromios (see above). In the 1923 production by the Ethiopian Art Theatre
          (also above), the New York Times (20 May 1923) praises Charles
          Olden for doubling the Dromios. Both sets of brothers were doubled in Stratford, Conn.
          (1963); in Stratford, Ont., in 1989, in a double bill with Tit.;
          in the BBC television production (1984) with Michael Kitchen as Antipholus and Roger
          Daltrey as Dromio (Willis, 1991, a detailed performance diary); and in the 1990 RSC
          production at Stratford-upon-Avon (above). The doubling requires that some speeches be cut
          or that they be combined. Sometimes a mute twin appears, playing with his back to the
          audience. In the television version, split-scene capabilities let the twins talk to each
          other.

        The problems that arise in doubling are addressed by Slawson (1991, pp. 67–8):
            While casting one actor as both Dromios or both Antipholuses may solve the
            problem of their appearance, it creates new problems for the director. Chief among these
            is blocking the final scene, in which both sets of twins appear onstage simultaneously.
            The most common solution . . . is to use a mute double for one of the
            twins and to cut or reassign the lines of that twin. However, unless skillfully done,
              [68] cutting parts of the final scene lessens the comic effect
            of the whole production.
          Holland (1997, pp.
          58–9) elaborates on the use of a single actor for both twins: Since the idea cannot
            possibly work in the theatre [as it can on television], I shall be wondering what is
            lost in the process. . . . One of the great [59] pleasures for
            the audience watching The Comedy of Errors is that we know the
            answer. We know, because Egeon has told us, that there are two pairs of twins; we know
            why Antipholus of Syracuse is recognized by the citizens of Ephesus and that the reason
            has nothing to do with Ephesus’ reputation for sorcery nor is it a dream. But we also
            find that the overweening confidence with which we begin, knowing the answers, is shaken
            in the course of the play. Every time I watch the play, I end up forgetting which Dromio
            has been sent on which errand by which Antipholus. . . . We are nearly as confused as
            the characters. When both Dromios are played by the same actor the audience’s ability to
            be confused, a confusion that the play wants us to undergo, is simply evaded, evaded
            because the audience comes to follow actor, not role, Graham Turner not
          Dromio.

        It has become usual to stage Err. with commedia dell’arte aspects, started on the English stage by
          Komisarjevsky in 1938. The first mention of such staging that I have found occurred at
          Strasbourg in 1935 in a performance by a traveling German company; the Dromios wore
            commedia costumes (Koszul, 1935, p. 184). How much
          earlier that company had adopted the costumes I do not know. The next I have found is
          Douglas Seale’s Birmingham Repertory Theatre production in 1948 (Trewin, 1963, p. 146). Clifford
          Williams’s 1962 RSC production featured an unobtrusive harlequinade as audience for
          Egeon’s tale, and thereafter as needed. Coincidentally, the 1963 Stratford, Ont., and
          Stratford, Conn., productions continued the trend.

        The Ontario production was directed by Jean Gascon to very bad reviews, not limited to
          the commedia aspects. Edinborough (1963, p. 433): He
            chose to ignore the text of The Comedy of Errors and make it a
            Punchinello pantomime affair . . . [with] five Punchinellos acting as general
            theatrical factotums around the stage. All the actors save the women wore
            commedia masks.

        The Connecticut production was directed by Douglas Seale, who presumably repeated his
          Birmingham production. Ogden (1963, p. 438) on Seale’s production: Apparently in order
            to alleviate the long opening recital, the director introduced a troupe of commedia dell’arte players. As Aegeon related
            his past history, the half-masked actors filed on, seated themselves facing the audience
            along the front edge of the apron, and occasionally one or the other mimed a bit of what
            was being said stage center. But as the evening progressed one began to wonder just what
            these figures had to do with the play. Upstage center they erected portions of a trestle
            stage, moved from pose to pose, watched the action, and at one point two members of the
            company interrupted the drama with a dance. But never did the troupe become part of the
            performance.

        Rogoff (1964, p.
          168) wonders why commedia should be used at
          all, referring to the coincidence of the employment of it in the two preceding
          productions, and says: As a directorial exercise, [Err.]
            asks only for a jubilant return to what might be called basic theatre . . . [to]
            primitive mummeries, lampoons, and Dionysiac celebrations. . . . There may be little
            inherently wrong in choosing commedia for
            production background, but it is, at least, less right than the available choice of
            earlier models, the Roman perhaps more than the Greek. . . . Why leave the roots
            behind?

        In addition to productions of Shakespeare’s play, a few adaptations are known about or
          guessed about, because only a few saw print.

        171610, 12, 13 Mar. Lincoln’s Inn Fields. Adapted in three acts as
            Every Body Mistaken by William Taverner and Dr. Brown. Not
          published. Avery
            (London Stage, 1960, 2.1:392): Main Piece Never Acted
            Before, that is, not since the reopening of the theaters in 1660.

        17349, 11, 14 Oct., 2 Nov. Covent Garden. Adapted as See If You Like It, or, ’Tis All a Mistake. Scouten (London
            Stage, 1961, 2.2:393): Afterpiece: A New Comedy in Two Acts, intermixed
            with Songs, taken from Plautus and Shakespear. &lt;Author unknown. Apparently not
            printed. Daily Journal lists Raleigh-Hall.&gt;

        1780? 1790Theatre-Royal, Edinburgh. The Twins, or,
            Which is Which. This is a three-act farce by William Woods. It begins with 1.2,
          inserting much of Egeon’s opening speech into the mouth of S. Antipholus. It inserts 1310–20 at 258. Act 1 ends at the end of Err. 3.1. Act 2 begins with a recapitulation of S. Antipholus’s adventures in
          Ephesus and continues at 861, the description
          of Nell. The act ends at 1424. Act 3 begins at
            1462. Woods (1783, p. 1) says that frequent
          repetitions of events in the play, and the mistakes, perplexed the
          audiences, which seems to indicate at least occasional performances in Edinburgh. He goes
          on, With a view to remedy these defects, the editor, a few years ago, reduced the
            comedy to three acts, and it was performed as an after-piece, with much approbation; but
            as his veneration for the author made him retain too many of the scenes, there still
            existed . . . too much confusion and uniformity of the original. He has therefore
            ventured to make further alterations. There is no record of its being played
          outside of Edinburgh.

        1780York? John Philip Kemble’s adaptation Oh! it’s
            impossible! The Dromios were played as black servants to puzzle the house
            as well as the stage (Boaden, 1825, 1:33). It was never published, and Boaden thinks that had
          it been, Kemble would have burned the whole impression on maturer
          judgment.

        ca. 1858New York. Ye Comedie Of Errours. A
            Glorious, Uproarous Burlesque. Not Indecorous nor Censorus, With Many A Chorus,
            Warranted Not To Bore Us, Now For The First Time Set Before Us. This is a
          blackface minstrel version, written by John F. Poole expressly for Charley
            White, a well-known minstrel born in 1821, who moved to England in 1859. It is
            a quite workable, small-scale transference of some of Shakespeare’s episodes to a
            New York negro setting (Wells, 1978, p. x). The main characters are named Andy Foolus
          and Dummy-O.

        Operas and musical versions based on Err. are as few as the
          adaptations.

        178612 Dec. Vienna. Stephen Storace, Mozart’s friend and likely
          student, wrote Gli Equivoci, with an excellent libretto by
            Da Ponte [who] changed most of the names: the Antipholuses becoming Euphemio,
          Adriana becoming Sofronio, sung by Storace’s sister Nancy; he invents a wife and little
          son, Dromioncino, for S. Euphemio (Fiske, 1986, pp. 495–6). It appears
          to have been successful.

        181911 Dec. Covent Garden, London. Frederick Reynolds’s operatic
          version, music (an overture and song settings) chosen by Henry Bishop, including Thomas
          Arne and Mozart (Gooch,
              Thatcher, et. al., 1991, 1:194). Genest (1832, 9:46–7):
            Shakspeare’s play was on this evening turned into an Opera—this literary murder
            was committed by Reynolds—he did not put his name to the play when printed, but in his
            Life he acknowledges the fact. . . . [47] Reynolds, when the
            important business of a song is not concerned, does not differ much from Kemble’s text
            [1811, i.e., Hull]. . . . He has added some other short speeches, which do him but
            little credit.
          Hunt (1949, pp.
          327–90), reviewing this version on 26 Dec. 1819, is disgusted by the complete lack of
          resemblance in the twins (persons no more resembling each other than moisture and
            drought), but otherwise finds the production attractive, granted that it has
          little to do with Err. It was acted 27 times.

        Act 1 scene 2—Luciana enters sola for the sake of singing a song—at the close of
            the act, a new scene is added for the sake of a sonnet and a glee—Antipholus of Ephesus
            enters with Balthazar, and wishes him good night—the improvers of
            Shakspeare rarely fail to fall into absurdities. Reynolds says in his
          introduction to his version that since Err. is such a short play,
          it has been selected as the best vehicle for the introduction of songs from
          other plays which use, however, has required additional scenes and
            passages . . . absolutely necessary for this purpose. The songs, some of them
          slightly adapted, include the Willow song; Under the greenwood tree;
          Edgar’s Swithold footed thrice the ’old; Bacchus, monarch of the
            vine; It was a lover and his lass; Blow, blow, thou winter
            wind; Tell me, where is fancy bred?; What shall he have
            that kill’d the deer; stanzas from Ven.; and several
          poems from The Passionate Pilgrim, including Come live
            with me and be my love.

        But there is more: some of the stage business found in the later prompt-books begins with
          Reynolds; his is examined below.

        19237 May. Frazee Theatre, New York. Ethiopian Art Theatre, a
          Chicago-based Negro company formed by Raymond O’Neil in the 1920s. New York Times (20 May, X): The action takes place on a rude
            platform in a circus tent and absurd scenes are shifted by clowns under the crack of the
            ringmaster’s whip. A jazz band plays, not only for the scene shifters but for Dromio
            himself when he is most furiously clowning. The Dromios were played by Charles
          Olden.

        193823 Nov. Alvin Theatre, New York. The Boys from
            Syracuse. Music by Richard Rogers; lyrics by Lorenz Hart; book by George Abbott,
          who also directed the show. Ronnie Graham was E. Antipholus, Eddie Albert was his brother,
          Jimmy Savo was S. Dromio, and Teddy Hart his brother. The production staff comprised Jo
          Mielziner (scenery and lighting), George Balanchine (choreographry), and Irene Scharaff
          (costumes). Falling in Love with Love,
          This Can’t Be Love, and Sing for Your
            Supper became popular standards. It was made into a film in 1940 with Joe Penner
          playing both Dromios, Martha Raye as Luce, Eric Blore as Pinch, and Eddie Acuff as a
          taxi-driver (Rothwell
            &amp; Melzer, 1990, p. 42).

        19508 June. Cambridge, England, Amateur Dramatic Club. Times ([London] 9 June, p. 4e): John Barton produced a musical
          burlesque that, while it had little resemblance to Err., caused
          great pleasure.

        195416 May. BBC TV. An operetta, music by Julian Slade, libretto by
          Lionel Harris, with Joan Plowright as Adriana (Gooch, Thatcher, et al., 1991,
          1:215). This production was revived 28 Mar. 1956, at the Arts, London.

        199412 Dec. Gray’s Inn hall. (Play program): With music by
              Julian Slade. Lyrics adapted from Shakespeare by James Cairncross. This was the 1954, 1956 BBC production
          (above) with new and revised music by Slade. The cast was a mixture of professionals and
          amateurs and was directed by Anthony Besch. The screen doors and balcony were used, but
          the action took place on a raised stage along the north wall, facing the audience.

        Other operas and musical versions include Irrungen, 11 Mar.
          1939, Stettin, Germany; Revolt in Ephesus, Prague, 1944; a musical theater
          piece for children, 29 Aug. 1974, at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, Cleveland; a
          musical that was first performed in Tel Aviv, 8 Mar. 1975; and errors, a chamber opera with music by Andrew Wilson-Dickson and libretto by
          Roger Warren, who also directed, Leicester Haymarket Theatre, 18 June 1980 (Gooch, Thatcher et al., 1991, 1:211–15).

      





      
        The Text on the Stage

        I have examined the following prompt-books and printed texts based on performances at
          specific theaters and dates. The prompt-books contain, on interleaved pages or blank
          spaces in the text, descriptions of the scenery, props, costumes, and stage business; I
          have excerpted a few of these to give some flavor of productions. But much of my
          discussion deals with the changes made in Sh.’s language. Halstead (1979, vol. 2) collates most
          of the following prompt-books, and several more, but his collations are sometimes
          incorrect or misleading. For the theatrical texts I give the Folger Library identification
          number, Shattuck’s
          (1965) identification number, or a library call number.

        The treatment of the text, from Smock Alley in the 1670s through most of the 19th c., is
          a history of cutting what is already a very short play. At 1,920 lines it is the shortest
          in the canon (line counts before the standardizing of TLNs use 1,735, 1,787, or some such
          as the number of lines). Songs were added as early as the Nursery arrangement; in the 18th
          c. the play was either the main piece or an after-piece in an evening of two plays, and
          indeed it has been paired with Tit. in the 20th c. The earliest
          cuts often involve ten or more consecutive lines, totaling 400–500 lines per version. All
          these cuts take out pretty much the same material: most of Egeon’s and the Abbess’s roles,
          Adriana and Luciana’s debate on wifely subordination, badinage between master and servant
          involving obscure or indecent puns, speeches expressing Adriana’s jealousy, S.
          Antipholus’s highly decorated wooing of Luciana, indecent or blasphemous material
          involving the Courtesan, and speeches in Act 5 that recapitulate the action.

        The data detailed below are drawn from the following versions of the play:

              Alley; Shattuck, no. 1.]

            Evans (1996,
              p. 73): [This] strictly speaking, is not a prompt-book. It contains no scene
                settings, actors’ names and the like, though it is fairly heavily cut
                for acting, possibly . . . to be presented as an afterpiece.
          


          
            2.Hatton Garden Nursery. Ca. 1672. (G. Blakemore Evans, Shakespearean Prompt-Books, 1964, vol. 3.)

            Shattuck
              (1965, p. 67): Prompt-book thoroughly marked and used. Cuts and alterations.
                Songs and dances indicated. Entrance cues are long lines with vertical slashes.
                Names of 11 actors appear in all.
              Evans lists
              and comments on all the markings in both this and the Smock Alley facsimile; he also
              compares the cuts and the rewrites in them to those in several of the prompt-books
              below.

              London: Printed for J. Tonson, and the rest of the Proprietors . . . 1734.

            This is a reprint of Pope (ed. 1728), to protest a pirated ed. of several of Sh.’s plays
              by R. Walker and his Accomplices . . . [who], to screen their innumerable
                Errors, advertize, that they are printed as they are acted; and industriously
                report, that the said Plays are printed from Copies made use of at the
                Theatres, as William Chetwood, prompter at Drury Lane, says in his
              introduction, declaring that no one has ever had a prompt copy from him. Pope
                degraded passages he thought unworthy of Sh. to the bottom of the
              pages, but he also marked passages he particularly liked in quotation marks (ed. 1725,
              1:xxii f.). (These lines are misunderstood as cuts in Halstead’s analysis.) This
              probably is what Macklin played in 1741, before Thomas Hull’s version replaced
              Pope’s.

              Dramatic Censor [Francis Gentleman]. London: Printed for John Bell . . . 1774.

            This ed. seems to be based on Capell (ed. 1768). Gentleman puts in quotation marks
              passages, usually accompanied by justifying footnotes, that he recommends cutting,
              though he lets them stand in the text rather than degrading them.
          


          
            5.Hull: The Comedy of Errors with Alterations from Shakspeare.
              Adapted for Theatrical Representation by Thomas Hull. As Performed at the
              Theatre-Royal, Covent-Garden. A New Edition. . . . London. Printed by John Bell,
              British Library, Strand . . . 1793. (Cornmarket Press Facsimile, 1971.)

            As noted above, the longtime actor at Covent Garden, Thomas Hull, began modifying
                Err. as early as 1762; he published his version in 1770,
              and again in 1793, the one examined here. His adaptations held the stage for over
              fifty years. In the cast list he names the Courtesan Lesbia (Lesbias is
              a misprint in the Dramatis Personae); Luce becomes Bridget in 3.1, but is not named in
              the DP.

            Halstead does
              not recognize the importance of this adaptation, and thus credits Inchbald or Kemble
              with variants found initially here; hence, Halstead’s analysis is very misleading in
              this respect.
          


          
            6.Inchbald: The Comedy of Errors; In Five Acts; By William
              Shakspeare. As Performed at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden. Printed under the
              Authority of the Managers from the Prompt Book. With Remarks by Mrs. Inchbald.
              London . . . [1808]. (The British Theatre, vol. 1.)

            This is Hull’s adaptation, very slightly adjusted. While it is common to refer to
              this ed. as Mrs. Inchbald’s, she presumably had no hand in the text. John Philip
              Kemble had taken over as manager at Covent Garden in 1802; his company played Err. on 9 Jan. 1808. Kemble customarily prepared new prompt-books
              for his revivals; Covent Garden burned down on 20 Sept. 1808, destroying the contents
              of the building including the library (Boaden, 1825, 2:452–8).
          


          
            7.Kemble: Shakspeare’s Comedy of Errors, Adapted to the Stage by
              Thomas Hull; Revised by J. P. Kemble, and Now First Published as it is Acted at The
              Theatre Royal in Covent Garden. London: Printed for the Theatre. 1811. [Folger PR
              2804|1811|Sh Col.; John Philip Kemble Promptbooks. Vol. 1.
              1974.]

            A prompt-book, lightly annotated in Kemble’s hand, of Hull’s adaptation, with a few
              verbal changes, directions for actors’ movements, blocking for ensemble scenes, and
              some stage business. Kemble names the first and second Merchants Cleon and Chares. His
                Persons Represented consist of Gentlemen—Attendants on Doctor Pinch—Executioner—Sisters of the
                Convent. He does not print the words for Hermia’s song in 3.2 (see
              below), and gives the messenger’s speech, 1641–50, to Bridget, thus perhaps saving
              himself the cost of a small speaking part.

            This is the text of the first revival following the 1808 fire. The title page makes
              it clear that Kemble sold his acting versions at his theater. Since Inchbald and
              Kemble follow Hull so closely, they will be mentioned only when they differ from Hull.

              (1974, 1:xviii ff.) contains a concise description of staging methods that use
              grooves, cuts, and drops.

        The Smock Alley reviser, probably Joseph Ashbury, streamlines the text in often admirable
          ways, as for example 45b–52, where Egeon muddies the water about why he was away (business trip) from
          his wife for most of her pregnancy (muddies because the lines about his
          agent’s death’s endangering his wealth and the periphrasis about her pregnancy are not
          strictly necessary). At To Epidamium, a hand adds
          something like where some time | wee liv’d, and at 53 rewrites: There had we [not she] not been long, before the birth of the twins.

        Balthazar is deleted from the SD to 3.1, and a single line surviving from his part, 640, is spoken instead by Angelo. Even that line
          is cut by Hull. Oddly, Balthazar reappears in Inchbald’s Dramatis Personae (Mr. Atkins),
          presumably because Hull retained (his spelling) You’re sad, Signor
            Balthasar (638); the character is
          silent, and yet the custom of casting him continued, beginning with Cumberland (1827).

        Cuts from 1.1: 12–13,
            35–9, 45b–52, 67–80, 90–7a, 101–5, 107–11, 118–23, ?149–51 (unclear whether a cut is
          intended), 153a, 154b, most to shorten Egeon’s long speech. From 1.2: 245, possibly as no longer idiomatic; and 264–71, possibly as
          redundant.

        From 2.1: 282–315,
          Adriana and Luciana’s debate about marital obedience; 317; and 364–89, which include the most garbled lines in the play;
            392, consequent in a slightly rewritten form
          on the previous cut. From 2.2: 421–35; 458–503, the wordplay on Time and baldness but including who wafts vs
            yonder; 516–17, the unclear or difficult vndiuidable Incorporate; 523, simplifying the image; 525–41, Adriana’s complaint about her
          husband’s cold distance; 564–74, her continuing complaint, containing the elm-vine topos; 596, ?indecency of she rides me;
            604, perhaps because of the popish
            shriue you.

        From 3.1: Balthazar is dropped; 641–50, the badinage about hospitality; 685–97, the possible sexual
          innuendo between Luce and E. Dromio; 702–5, more backchat; 713–20, perhaps because of a reference to hospitality again;
            725–8, sexual
          innuendo; 732–6, puns on
          breaking wind; 747–67,
          reducing Angelo’s (i.e., Balthazar’s) long speech; 769–75, E. Antipholis’s plan to dine with the Courtesan,
          with its protestation of sexual innocence (these lines undergo several cuts and later
          stets; it is hard to judge the final intention). From 3.2: 788b–94, 797–804, 807–10, 813–14, all four cuts are part of
          Luciana’s urging E. Antipholis to conduct his adultery stealthily; 820–7, S. Antipholis’s
          perhaps overdecorated language, e.g., earthie grosse conceit; 832–46, the same problem;
            910–19, part of E.
          Dromio’s description of Nell, cutting references to Scotland, France, England, but
          retaining indecent references to Spain, America, and the Netherlands; 944–54, S. Antipholis’s fear that he has
          been enchanted and his vow to leave.

        From 4.1: 1008–9,
          sexual innuendo; 1036–7,
            1043–4, perhaps to cut
          the chain passage; 1047; 1066; 1082b. From 4.2: 1105–9, 1111b, possibly to mute the
          suggestion of sexual misbehavior or possibly to cut the hearts Meteors
          conceit; 1118–34,
          Adriana’s shrewish complaints; 1143–9, S. Dromio’s perhaps unintelligible puns involving his master’s arrest;
            1170–7, puns on Time;
            1181–2, cuts the final
          couplet with its cloudy allusion to Adriana’s conceit. From 4.3: 1196–7, 1198b–1218a, more
          of S. Dromio’s perhaps unintelligible puns; 1243–7, the difficult or even lost sense of needing a long
          spoon to sup with the Devil; 1265–74, the Courtesan’s diagnosis of S. Antipholis. From 4.4: 1303; 1318–20, I beare . . . doore, possibly
          indecent; 1412–13,
          perhaps unnecessary.

        From Act 5: 1516–60, a
          provisional cut, but restored in part. Of these lines, certainly cut are 1519–21 (1519 restored), acceptance of sexual misconduct; 1526–30 (1527 restored); 1544–53, the Abbess’s perhaps too conceited diagnosis; 1561–70, the Abbess’s
          denial of Adriana’s desire to nurse her husband, covered by the next speech; 1575–81, perhaps a too
          favorable presentation of popish matters (these five cuts remove about half the Abbess’s
          lines); 1587, the ambiguous Diall
            points at fiue; 1609–10, unclear reference to why Adriana married; 1612–26, Adriana’s exaggerated
          description of her husband’s madness, some parts of which we have seen;
            1630; 1633–6, the Duke’s statement of E. Antipholis’s war service,
          cut because it comes from nowhere and leads to nothing; 1667–70, further references to E.
          Antipholis’s war service; 1674, reference to
          the cause of the marriage; 1676–8, perhaps muting Adriana’s shrewishness; ?1692–7, cut to simplify the cause of E.
          Antipholis’s behavior; 1696b–8, cut to simplify; 1708–30, the redundant report of the
          day’s happenings; 1783–7, E. Dromio’s denial of knowing Egeon, perhaps redundant; 1792–9, the conceited old-age imagery;
            1827–31, repetitious
          of known facts; 1845 and 1847, as redundant in the Abbess’s speech; 1853–5, cuts Menaphon; 1881–3, perhaps not cut; 1887–96, cuts the Abbess’s
          chronology.

        These cuts number about 538 lines and half-lines. They inevitably anticipate most of what
          later producers would cut, chiefly by shortening long speeches, getting rid of the
          unintelligible (either garbled lines or references that no longer made sense), and
          deleting offensive sexual or religious language. It is interesting that, as a reflection
          of changes in taste, Sh.’s images are sometimes apparently thought to be too
          ingenious.

        There is also some minor rewriting, e.g., 106
          At last
          [o]ur helpefull; 521
          gulfe for sea; 542
          dame for Lady; 620
          shrewish for peevish; 612
          Carkanet for golden chain; 795
          but
          [l]et; 1218
          I sent thee to the bay roge to see if
          any ships; and the senseless switching of S. and E. Dromio in the last two
          speech prefixes.

        Hull’s 1793 version, adopted by Kemble, influenced performances of Err. until Phelps restored much of the original text and cut Hull’s additions,
          though many of Hull’s cuts were retained. Child (1935, p. 8) summarizes the nature of Hull’s changes
          when he writes about Kemble’s theatrical practices: His Comedy of
              Errors at Covent Garden in 1808 was nothing but the version made for that
            theatre nearly thirty years before [i.e., Hull’s] . . . —a version which takes infinite
            pains to remove every trace of rhyme; turns the chain into a bracelet; mixes up
            Balthazar and Aegeon [sic for Angelo]; squeezes pathos or sentiment into
            the Antipholis (sic)-Adriana-Luciana plot, writes up Dromio of
            Syracuse into a fat part (Gentleman Lewis had been great in it, and Munden followed
            him), and gives to Antipholis of Syracuse one immortal line of blank verse: In
              spite of my assertion to the contrary—where Shakespeare had written:
              For urging it the second time to me.

        Hull rewrites the rhymed speeches into blank verse at 286–317, 577–81, 787–860, and 1104–34; the rewriting involves cuts as
          well. The quality of Hull’s rewriting may be seen in Luciana’s speech on female
          subordination (289–99):
            Why, headstrong liberty belongs to a man, And ill befits a
            woman’s gentle mind. There’s nothing situate under Heaven’s eye, But hath it’s
            [sic] bound on earth, in sea, and air; The beasts, the fishes, and the winged
            tribes, Are their males subjects, and at their controul. Man, more divine, the
            master of them all Indued with intellectual sense and soul, Is master to his
            female—nay her lord! Let then your will attend on his commands.

        Hull retains some of the Smock Alley cuts—how could he not?—but he also initiates many
          other changes. In 1.1, he avoids the problem of how the boys came to have the same name
            (And, which was strange, the one so like the other, | As could not be
            distinguish’d but by names,
          55–6) this way: our wealth increas’d By prosp’rous traffic—’till
            my factor’s death, Drew us unwillingly to Epidamnum. There had we not been
            long, but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons, And, strange to hear,
            the one so like the other, They hardly by ourselves could be distinguished.
          He rewrites the opening speech, adding after TLN 5
          And terminate, by this, thy rig’rous doom, | Ægeon’s life and miseries
            together. After 64, the Duke
          interrupts Ægeon’s account with Stop thy tears—| I long, yet almost dread to hear
            the rest, to break up the long speech, which he, like most producers, cuts by
          close to half. At the end of the scene, Ægeon’s exit speech becomes What friends can misery expect? This pity but prolongs the date of pain: And
            to a sure, though short protracted end, Helpless and hopeless doth Ægeon
            wend, which shows that Hull will write rhymes, though why he reverses Sh.’s
            Hopelesse and helpelesse is a mystery.

        In 1.2 following 180
          meane, Dromio wonders why Antipholis trusts him with so much money, and
          Antipholis replies that he believes that Dromio loves him too much to rob him; the
          dialogue amounts to 16 lines, serving to cement the loyalty of master and servant. The
          rest of the scene goes by largely unscathed until S. Antipholis’s final speech, which is
          replaced after 262 by lines beginning
            Misguided by my hopes, in doubt I stray, | To seek what I perchance, may never
            find; the note of a frightening Ephesus is replaced by sentimentality.

        Except for rewriting the rhymed dialogue on marital obedience and cutting 354–7, perhaps to get rid
          of the puns in 2.1, Hull allows the scene to stand, though he rewrites the garbled passage
            382–9: Sister, you know he promis’d me a bracelet— Some stranger fair hath
            caught his truant eye, And triumphs in the gifts design’d for me. Such trifles
            yet with ease I could forego, So I were sure he left his heart at home! I see
            the jewel best enameled Will lose its lustre—so doth Adriana— Whom once,
            unwearied with continual gazing, He fondly call’d the treasure of his
          life!

        In 2.2 much of the punning between servant and master on sconces and Time (429–502) is cut by Hull
          (and by most others, beginning with Smock Alley); the scene resumes at Adriana and
          Luciana’s entrance (504). For the rhymed
          couplets of 577–81, he
          substitutes What, was I married to her in my sleep; | Or sleep I now, and dream I
            hear all this? | What error thus deceives our eyes and ears? | Yet, that the mystery I
            may explore, | I’ll seem to entertain the fallacy. He then cuts S. Dromio’s 583–7, on being caught in
          fairy land; rearranges some lines; cuts 607–15; and substitutes 16 lines, beginning Spread for dinner. I am afraid I shall Be somewhat awkward, as I am
            not Acquainted with the ways of the house, Tho’ I suppose they’ll be so
            courteous As to instruct a new-comer.—Ay, there they go— The house with the
            green doors, which answers a question—whoever asked it?—about how the stranger
          managed to guard the door so well; it also tells us a bit about the scenery. The
          prompt-books specify a practical, i.e., workable, lockable door outfitted
          with a bell; this was built into the flat usually called the Street house,
          located in the second groove.

        He makes several changes in 3.1. He cuts 630–7, adding Silence, thou sot, or I shall sober
            thee! before 638, and then cuts 641–50, as does Smock
          Alley. At 651, But soft, my doore is
            lockt, he adds, Sirrah, ring the bell, allowing E. Dromio to say
            Oh, he’s a little soberer, and he does know his own house now, before an
          accompanying Rings. He then inserts before 652: An. of
                Eph.Will they not hear?
            Dr. of Eph.In good truth, I think they will not.—My
                mistress, sure, means to be quits with you, master—you denied her a while ago, and
                now she’s determined to deny you.
            An. of Eph.Have done, thou varlet. Call to them, bid them
                let us in. He cuts Either get thee from the dore, or sit
            downe at the hatch (655), presumably
          because his stage door was solid. Following 712, he cuts 713–44, as does Smock Alley in large part, and substitutes: An. of Eph.Get from the gate?—What means this saucy
                language? There’s something more in this!—Why, Adriana!
            Ad.[Within.] Hence, you
                familiar coxcomb! Cease your noise, Or you shall surely pay for all this
                outrage.— Dromio, make sure you keep fast the doors against ’em.
            An. of Eph.Why, wife, I say.—
            Dr. of Syr.[Within.]
                She’s gone back to dinner, sir, to take a refreshing cup, and has no time to answer
                idle questions now.
            An. of Eph.Now, on my soul, some strange mysterious
                guile, Lurks underneath this unaccustom’d usage. Some shameful minion is
                here entertain’d— Shall I be thus shut forth from my own house, While they
                are revelling to my dishonour? Go, fetch an instrument—I’ll break the door,
                Shatter it to pieces, but I’ll enter. At the end of the scene,
          he cuts 781–2 and adds
          after 783 for E. Antipholis: I thank you, sir.—And now, my dainty wife, Checking my rage, I’ll
            leave you to your follies Some few short hours; enjoy them while you may,
            Perchance to-morrow you may rue your jest.

        His largest addition comes at the beginning of 3.2, where he brings onstage in a
              A Garden S. Antipholis, Adriana, Luciana, and
            Hermia, whose sole function is to sing Michael Arne’s setting of Hull’s
            Stray not to those distant plains, a pastoral wish that the beloved
            tarry here with me and love. This addition with its song presumably goes
          back to the 1762 Twins (above), since Arne died in 1784; for the
          1779 revival, Charles Dibdin’s setting was used (Gooch, Thatcher, et al., 1991,
          1:197). The song is preceded by Adriana’s asking S. Antipholis why he is so distant, and
          he replies I would some friendly light | Might chase away the mist that clouds our
            fancies, | And give this dream a meaning! He goes on to describe the garden,
            These beauteous bowers, in nature’s fragrance rich, the whole addition
          apparently concocted to employ pastoral scenery and the song. Sometimes the addition was
          cut. Fawcett, in the J. S. Clarke prompt-book: When wanting to play the piece
            quickly this scene is cut to the entrance of Ant of S . . . beginning with Why
              how now Dromio [862], a
          drastic cut that deletes the wooing of Luciana.

        After the song, Adriana continues, using lines adapted and repeated from 505–41 in 2.2 until she and
          Hermia exit and 3.2 begins as in Sh. Hull’s repetition of 525–41 in 2.2 and 3.2 is puzzling; the
          lines disappear from 2.2 as early as Inchbald (1808); the lines had been cut by Smock
          Alley.

        Hull now adds 3.3, the meeting between S. Antipholis and Angelo (956–72), which cannot take place in the
          garden but rather requires a change of scenery. At the end of his 3.2 Hull, having cut
          Dromio’s geography of Nell (889–927), has Antipholis exit and lets Dromio conclude the scene with 944–5, As from a
            bear a man would run for life, | So I from her that swears she is my wife, and
          exit. His new scene begins with the entrance of Angelo greeting S. Antipholis (956). The scene is required because the garden
          scenery (located in the sixth or last groove, noted in the prompt-books) has to be
          replaced by The Street scenery (located in the first or second grooves) so
          that the two can speak. This new scene requires that Antipholis exit and return
          immediately after Dromio’s lines, unless Hull’s Act 1 ends at Dromio’s exit. This latter
          appears to be what happens. Kemble (1811) adds in his hand to the new entrance of Angelo
          and Antipholis and Dromio of Syracuse, plus the line Ant. of Syr. Haste to the port, and find me out some ship,
          before Angelo’s greeting (956). Kemble is
          elaborating the beginning of Sh.’s Act 2. The scene ends with Antipholis’s rewritten
          soliloquy praising Luciana, which concludes with Unwillingly I go—my wounded soul,
            | (Howe’er from Ephesus my body part) | Lingers behind in Luciana’s heart.

        Despite the preservation of F’s five-act division in print, Hull’s 1793 version perhaps,
          and later performances certainly, were presented in three acts. The Folger Library has a
          playbill for the 31 May 1791 performance, a benefit for Hull: After which [i.e.
              The Midnight Lover] will be performed (in Three Acts) The
            COMEDY of ERRORS.

        The 19th-c. prompt-books make it clear that the curtain drops at Dromio’s exit at 3.2
          (the bear line), and again at the end of 4.4. As we will see, Reynolds’s
          prompt-book describes a pantomime between S. Dromio and Luce that marks the end of his Act
          1. Act 2 (in a three-act version) begins with Dromio entering, repeating those two lines
          about running from a bear, and being sent off to the port. Act 2 ends at 1461, with a good deal of horseplay, recorded in
          the prompt-books, involving struggles between Pinch and the Syracusans, who enter at 1440. In fact, Cumberland’s SD is Dr. Pinch runs across from R. to L. after them. This business continues well after Phelps had
          returned to the authentic play, as prompt-books 12, 13, and 14 testify.

        Hull’s Act 2 follows Sh.’s Act 4 closely. At the end of Sh’s 4.1 he expands Dromio’s
          speech about returning to Adriana’s to get the purse of ducats; Dromio worries that
            Blowzabell, the renamed Dowsabell, may appear and fright me from
            my purpose. In Sh.’s 4.2, after 1128
          Hull gives Luciana an expanded speech urging Adriana’s patience while expressing
          admiration for S. Antipholis’s person as a prelude to her accepting him at
          the end of the play. In 4.3, the meeting of the Courtesan/Lesbia with the Syracusan twins
          is greatly rewritten. Lines 1231–63 are replaced with S. Antipholis’s scolding her for her looseness: What more temptations? Mistress, you do impeach your modesty,
            Here in the street to commit yourself Into the hands of one who knows you
            not. The Placides give us stage business to accompany her entrance:
            Fondling around his neck. As the Syracusans move to leave her, she
          follows, and Dromio turns on her: No, you don’t. [Draws.]
            Here’s my charm against witches, followed by 1237–40. The Placides, Clarke, and Crane
          &amp; Robson record a variant piece of business involving a horseshoe, the charm against
          witches and evil in general: Lesbia turns to Dromio. he faces her, pulls out a
            Horseshoe, and Xes in front to R. H. Hull follows Sh.’s 4.4 almost exactly, but
          he changes Adriana’s Oh binde him, binde him (1396) to O! hold him, hold him, which signals a
          change in business. Reynolds’s prompt-book below shows how the scene was played.

        Hull says in his preface that he provides a more satisfactory
            catastrophe than Sh.’s. Following 1831 Ægeon, Æmilia, and S. Antipholis supply the feeling that Hull finds missing,
          beginning Ægeon. Æmilia! O! support thyself, my soul! | Till
            I, once more, have caught thee within my arms, | Their long, lost happiness!
          Antipholis’s speech includes O raise my father, raise your reverend hands | And
            bless your truant son! Ægeon asks where his lost son is, Æmilia speaks 1841–7, then E. Antipholis
          comes forward with an affecting greeting of his parents, and the brothers embrace.
          Following 1863, Hull amplifies the future of
          Luciana, as S. Antipholis continues: And that the heart which
                beats alone for you, May, now the mist of error is dispers’d, Which made
                thee fearful for thy virgin fame, Obtain a gentle hearing.
            Luc.Should I find thee Worthy, and constant, as my
                mind suggests, The general joy, that smiles around, shall not Be damp’d by
                any vain reserve of mine. Following 1897, the Duke continues: And be a
                cheerful witness of the blessings, Your pious faith, and virtuous resignation,
                Have drawn upon you from relenting Heaven!
            Ægeon.Come, and partake The joys, that gild the
                evening of our days.
            Æmilia.Joys past the reach of hope!—our lesson this,
                That misery past endears our present bliss; Wherein we read with wonder
                and delight, This sacred truth, Whatever is, is
            right.

        So ends the play. Strikingly, Hull omits the happy recognition of the Dromios that ends
          the play proper.

        His 1793 text is 1,544 lines long.

        Inchbald’s 1808 version copies Hull; the differences may be no more than mistakes. For
          example, thy natiue home (33)
          becomes my native home, and is immediately corrected in 1811. The First and
          Second Merchants have not yet been given names.

        Kemble’s 1811 prompt-book has a few handwritten directions for cuts and wording, as well
          as directions for actors’ movements. As we have seen, Kemble adjusts Hull’s 3.3, the
          meeting of S. Antipholis and Angelo, to bring on S. Dromio. He cuts 1540–5, 1614–16, and 1618–19 (as do most playbooks after 1811,
          which are willing to shorten the Abbess’s role even more; Smock Alley anticipates many of
          these cuts). The first Merchant is now Cleon, the second is Chares, as they will continue
          to be named.

        Reynolds’s 1819 musical version involves some rewriting that describes stage business
          that comes to be recorded in the 19th-c. prompt-books.

        At the end of Sh’s 2.2, Reynolds modifies Hull’s lines (gone is the reference to the
          green door). Dromio is haled from within Dromio, Dromio, and he responds,
            Oh! a lady in waiting—Dear sweet unknown! thy doating Dromio comes. The
          Placides milk this business a bit: after lady in waiting, they add,
            Oh, Oh! its my turn now, and if love making be the only mischief going forward,
            the servant may take place of the master, concluding as Hull does. This business
          prepares for the pantomime at the end of Sh.’s 3.2 (Reynolds’s Act 1).

        In 3.1, when E. Antipholis has decided to break down his door, he says to Dromio
            Go. (To Dromio, stamping and menacing). Dromio.
            Gone! This addition becomes common.

        Reynolds replaces Hull’s 3.3 with S. Antipholis entering alone to
          praise Luciana, followed by S. Dromio’s lines from Sh.’s 3.2 saying that he is afraid the
          kitchen wench will turn him into a curtal dog made to turn i’ the wheel
            (935–6); Reynolds adds
            I fly with joy, for now I shall be blown safe, | From this same scullion—this
            mountain of mad flesh (moved from 1457), then As he is going off, the fat Kitchen Wench suddenly throws up
            the window in Antipholis’s house, and shakes her fist at him. Kitchen
              W. Come back, or I’ll so baste thee Dromio. Dr. of Syr.
            ’Tis she. Notice that the flat containing the workable door now requires a
          workable window. The Placides add more to the pantomime: the Cook (their Kitchen Wench)
          leans out of the window to shake a ladle (a prop suggested by the basting
          language in Err.) at him, leaves the window, enters to Dromio,
          and She catches Dromio. He throws her down—and runs off. L[eft]. She pursues him,
            through 1st &amp; 2 entrances. Dromio hides behind 1. E[ntrance]. R[ight]. H[and].—Cook
            falls over his foot—Dromio hastily pulls her dress over her feet and runs off. Cook
            rises limping. Ring quick, ending their Act 1. This business appears
          irresistible to the actors. J. S. Clarke adds Music. Enter the cook, made up very
            large, but neat—sees Drom. of S. she chases him round as she x’s he trips her up up
            [sic] &amp; while down he exits L. 1. E she being large takes time to rise &amp; as she
            rises (Enter Dromio of Ephesus R.1.E. . . . they see each other—ad lib comic bus. Dro.
            in Cooks embrace: Ring! These calls for a quick curtain complete the evolution
          of a 3-act structure going back to Hull.

        Reynolds provides more business for S. Dromio in 4.2, after he bursts in to get the purse
          E. Antipholis needs to pay Angelo. At 1158,
            this I wonder at, Adriana (turning to Dromio, who is fanning
            himself) Why how now? Thou art faint! Dr. To be sure I am. Adr. Go—refresh thyself—(Dromio smiles and bows.) Haste—repair thee
            to the kitchen. Dro. The kitchen! O Lord!—don’t mention it—I’m
            quite well, ma’am—quite! The 19th-c. prompt-books examined below write this
          material in.

        In 4.4, Reynolds follows Sh.-Hull to 1405,
          Pinch’s cry to Go bind this man, for he is frantic too, meaning E. Dromio.
          But Reynolds elaborates the action. Dr. of Eph. (Rubbing his
            hands with joy.) Good seize the gaoler! the shoulder slapper. Pinch. And him! (Pointing to Dromio.) Seize on that varlet—they are all
            possess’d, | And must be bound and laid in some dark room. Dro. of
              Eph. I! I bound in a dark room. Off. (To Doctor’s
            servants.) Stand off—. Only the Placides retain the business.

        Reynolds restores some of the Dromios’ reunion at the end of the play. They are allowed
          to say I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth. . . . And now let’s go hand in hand,
            not one before the other (1910–18), followed by their exit into the Abbey, for which
          Reynolds writes a final scene that preserves most of Hull’s sentimental conclusion. This
          restoration leads to greatly enhanced business for the Dromios. The most elaborate
          prompt-book description is the Placides’. The two Dromios at extreme corners Look
            at each other and turn away laughing—Approach each other C. and stepping in the same
            manner. When near each other, both burst out laughing and run back to proceniums [i.e.,
            the proscenium doors]. Both advance again to centre. They put up L. foot and laugh—they
            put up R. foot in same manner. Dromio of E. looks at himself from head to foot, Turns
            his brother round to look at him, and then giggles to himself—same business with Dromio
            of S. The dialogue ensues, then They place hands on each other’s
            shoulders, and go up as the others advance. The two Dromios change smiles at back, and
            come down extreme corners. Even this business evolves; J. S. Clarke gives part
          of it: at 1909
          [Dromios] who have been asleep R &amp; L Now gradually awake—yawn—both X to C &amp;
            up not seeing each other &amp; at the [proscenium] door as they are about to enter, see
            each other—start—, come down C—look at each other—the[y] embrace &amp; look
            together. Finally, the whole business becomes clear in the Crane &amp; Robson
          prompt-book, 1878: at 1775–6
          during this Dromio of Ephesus has gone to sleep L[eft]. H[and proscenium
            door], so 1783–7 is cut. At 1832
          During this Dromio of Syracuse enters quickly and unperceived and goes to sleep
            opposite the Dromio of E. R. H.

        Henry and Thomas Placide adopt many of the standard cuts noticed already; the following
          are either unique to the Placides or are the first. The most startling cut, considering
          that the passage has drawn the most academic comment, is that of S. Antipholis’s
          water-drop speech (199–204). Since the Placides played the Dromios, they may have thought that there
          was no need to make Antipholis needlessly interesting; they also take away his 1187–94. They cut the
          redundancy of 255, which repeats 254. Nearly like Smock Alley, they cut E.
          Antipholis’s plan to dine with the Courtesan (768b–75a), a cut followed by almost
          no one else. Cutting Pinch’s diagnosis of E. Antipholis as being possessed and needing to
          be tied up in a dark room (1380–2) may reflect current medical practice. They are the only ones to cut all
          of 1406–39—others cut
          bits and pieces—a passage that requires a lot of the cast to be onstage in very busy
          action at the end of Act 4. The Abbess’s refusal to turn E. Antipholis over
          to Adriana until she has cured him (1572–6; Smock Alley cuts 1575–81) may have seemed too detailed,
          though it is part of the other cuts having to do with illness, or perhaps it is just in
          the tradition of reducing the Abbess’s importance. The Placides are alone in cutting
          Ægeon’s misery at not being recognized by the Ephesian twins (1774–88a). One wonders whether the lines
          are expendably long, susceptible of misplaced laughter rather than pity, or what. Cyril
          Cusack, in the 1984 BBC TV production, wore no beard, so 1792–3 was cut.

        Samuel Phelps’s restoration (1855) has already been mentioned. He cuts only about 234
          lines, considerably fewer than anyone before him. Many are the usual cuts,
          bowdlerizations, removal of unintelligible puns, and the like. For example he cuts, from
          Egeon’s opening speech, 37–9, 46–52,
            72–8, 87, 91–3, 96, 103–5, 107–9, 116–17, 120–3, 139, 149–52, and 158–9, many anticipated by Smock Alley or Hull and followed
          by most others. He restores the garbled 385–9. Surprisingly, some of Hull’s additions remain: the
          Duke’s interruption after 64, Stop thy
            tears—| I long, yet almost dread, to hear the rest, seems irresistible; Dromio’s
          lines added by Hull at the end of 2.2 (following 607) are penciled in following 615—these are the important additions. His cuts include the punning on Time (458–502); E. Antipholis’s
          recapitulation (1698–1730); and 1910–15, reducing the Dromios’ reunion by half. The Merchants are Kemble’s Cleon
          and Chares, but Lesbia gives way to Courtezan. Phelps also adopts the act and scene
          divisions of F. Hence, the familiar statement that the Phelps production restored Sh.’s
          original text is only partly accurate.

        The Clarke prompt-book (3 Oct. 1864) is valuable in describing the
          marketplace setting of 4.3, as S. Antipholis remarks on how he has been familiarly
          approached. The prompt-book begins: Music. Scene 3. The Mart. A lively scene.
            Stalls R. &amp; L. on the extreme L. C. a tailors stall, with goods—and a large basket
            with cover to shut; goods hung over. As scene opens—Citizen Xx recross—stop at
            stalls—during which Enter Ant of Syracuse, some recognize him,—1 A woman meets him &amp;
            bows—2 A man gives him a scroll—3 a page gives him a letter—after this bus the music
            ceases and Ant of S speaks. The basket comes into play at the end of Act 2
            (Err. 4.4, TLN 1460) with business of a scuffle involving Pinch and both sets of twins, first the
          Syracusans who escape, then the Ephesians. E. Dromio breaks free and sees large
            basket L. H. jumps in &amp; shuts lid. Pinch sees him &amp; he &amp; 4 officers empty E
            Dro into the water &amp; seem done with Dro. Enter Dromio of Syracuse L. 1. E Comic
            horror of Dr Pinch—&amp; officers as they see Dromio who is C—with his back to the
            audience—&amp; Curtain. Music all through bus very ff.

        George Ellis’s prompt-book (for the 27 Feb. 1864 performance) markings are somewhat
          unlike the preceding ones because of his frequent canceling or replacing of just a word or
          two in a line, as well as adding more frequent notes on how to emphasize readings, e.g.,
            Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight (844–5). Examples of his minor changes are
            troubles for travels (142), failing for falling
            (201 in the water-drop speech), males
            subject for males subjects (293), woman for strumpet
            (1416), and strangers for harlots (1682). He
          follows several bowdlerizations of his predecessors: and she
            would . . . Sir-reverence (876–82), diviner (929), privy (930), as well as the expected replacements for
            God.

        He has fuller notes of business than his predecessors as well, especially when others
          than the Dromios are concerned. In 2.2, when Adriana and Luciana approach the Syracusans,
          Adriana takes his hand (505),
            embraces him (507), and at
            515, Antipholus is bewilder’d during
            this,—suddenly withdraws from Adr,—Dromio greatly excited, also. At 560–1, How can she
            thus then call us by our names | Unless it be by inspiration,
          Dro goes up L—in bewilderment,—looks about, at every thing &amp; every body &amp;
            goes over to R,—stands gaping with wonder—his back to the audience.

        It is interesting that in the same year (1864) that Clarke’s American prompt-book records
          the marketplace setting at the beginning of 4.3, Ellis has a new scene, his scene 7, that
          begins at Angelo’s entrance in 3.2 (955); this
          new scene is the one examined as Hull’s 3.3 above. Ellis’s setting is Exterior of
            the House of Antipholus of Ephesus | 2 Gro[ove]; the scene opens with Dromio’s
            As from a bear a man would run for life, | So fly I from her that would be my
            wife (944–5),
          then Enter Antipholus of Syracuse from the House. X’s stage—is going off R-1C—as
              Mercht &amp; friend enter L-1C—friend X’es &amp; Exit
            R-2C—as Mercht calls Ant—. His next scene, Sh.’s
          4.1., is the Mart, with a sketch showing two bales; directions call for two merchants and
          two porters, Mercht seated on a bale, writing mems
            &amp; notes—which he gives to both porters, and sends them off R &amp; L. These
          extras have additional business as far as 1040.

        Ellis’s production was in Feb. 1864, Clarke’s in Oct., but Ellis’s prompt-book was not
          prepared until 1882. Just when the staging of the busy marketplace began I cannot say.

        Komisarjevsky’s 1938 prompt-book gives a fascinating description of that landmark
          production, famous for its set with a manic clock that chimes hours unconnected with the
          chronology of the play. In the center of the stage is the abbey, with the clock, flanked
          on stage left by the Phoenix, Pinch’s house, the Tiger Inn, a pawn shop (the
            usurer’s, designated the 4th Merchant in SPs), Balthazar’s
          house, and the Porcupine, and on the right by the Centaur, a tailor’s house, an unmarked
          door, a fish stall (5th Merchant), and Angelo’s house. The Phoenix and the
          Porcupine have windows, used prominently. Ranged before the houses are three squat blocks
          used as seats. Sh.’s cast has been fleshed out with a tailor, innkeeper, three policemen,
          two sailors, two ladies, and the extra merchants. Luce is always called Nell. These extras
          groan, sigh, and murmur during the long speeches in the first and final acts. They are
          also given portions of the long speeches (e.g., 1588–97 are divided among the fourth Merchant, Balthazar,
          Angelo, Courtesan, the fifth Merchant, the tailor, and the first Merchant). Another
          feature of this production is the silent presence of Pinch and the Courtesan throughout
          the play; Nell appears at the Phoenix’s window or at the door, once amorously embracing E.
          Dromio.

        Komisarjevsky rearranges one section of the play to conclude his first act: after S.
          Antipholus’s wooing of Luciana and her exit to get Adriana’s goodwill (860), Angelo enters with the chain, offering it
          to the wrong brother (955–79). After the exit, Komisarjevsky inserts 1103–34 from 4.2, Adriana’s mortified
          response to Luciana’s report, played from the window of her house, followed by Dromio’s
          description of Nell, which brings down the curtain.

        The clock strikes seven times in the play, ringing 12 o’clock at the end of 1.1; 1
          o’clock and 2 o’clock at the end of 1.2, with the notice to Turn hands of clock
            quickly; 3 o’clock at 615, and 4
          o’clock at the interval curtain. But the next time it rings, it sounds 9 o’clock at 1161, presumably to account for the interval,
          then twice more, the last (10 o’clock) at 1598. The dialogue is adjusted either by cutting references to the passage of time
          (e.g., halfe an houre since—1051) or by rewriting (nine, eight for two, one—1166).

        Very little of the play is cut, but some speeches are reassigned, as we have seen.
          Perhaps the most interesting rearrangement occurs at 290–9, part of Luciana’s speech on female subordination;
          these lines, which sound bookish, are spoken by Pinch, who enters reading a book and is
          perhaps quoting from it.

        The 1962 Clifford Williams prompt-book contains by far the most detailed descriptions of
          movement of all these prompt-books. Pages of the unidentified printed play are pasted on
          workbook pages measuring 8″ x 10″ so as to put between 30 and 45 lines on a page, on
          average. Opposite these pages are the directions, sometimes as many as 30 to a page, which
          typically read (1.2): Enter U|S P|S Antipholus of Syracuse with 1st
            Merchant (to Ant’s P|S). X to C ros[trum] 1. Dromio of Syracuse follows X behind Ant to
            O|P C ros 1 to 8.

        1. 1 Mer gives Ant. money bag. Ant X to Dromio and gives it to him. 1 Mer
            break to P|S and face U|S. This full detail, some of it recording what common
          sense demands (giving and receiving the money bag), perhaps is the result of Williams’s
          having to get this production ready under emergency conditions, Paul Scofield’s inability
          to play Lear (above, ).

        The stage consisted of a podium at the rear, a rostrum of two levels four steps lower,
          and a forestage or proscenium lower still. There is no scenery; the locked door (3.1) is
          mimed. The wittiest direction is the introduction to 2.1: [Luciana] carries a small
            felt board with patience [solitaire] cards which she begins to prepare—witty
          because she urges patience on the impatient Adriana.

        The language of the play is practically untouched, the changes being in the nature of
            lighter for lesser (111), unstain’d for distain’d (541), and
            Who for That (1829); Thirtie three is changed to Twenty three (1890). Most
          surprising is the single cut of Fly pride, says the peacock,
            mistress, that you know (1262–3). Halstead, who collates the 1963 revival, records a few more
          cuts.

        Nunn’s 1977 production at the Aldwych cuts fewer than 100 lines, though many are used as
          songs. The play begins with the Duke’s I am not partial to infringe our
            laws (8), followed by Egeon’s
          opening lines, then 9–14, minus Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more, which is moved to
          follow 23. The cuts of 68, 72–8, 101–2,
            122–4, 143–4, 155, and 161–2 pare away awkwardnesses, especially Try all the
            friends thou hast in Ephesus (155), which seems silly considering that Egeon has just arrived
          after his five-year search for his sons. Well, perhaps a merchant might have business
          associates, a consideration that may explain why none of the other acting versions
          considered cuts the line. But he does not sound confident about getting the money.

        Act 1 ends with the first song, Beg Thou, a setting of 156–7, performed while the
          stage is transformed into an outdoor cafe. In 1.2, only the joke about scoring on posts
            (229–30) is cut. In
          2.1, the rhymed couplet 300–1 is cut, making way for Liberty Song, set from 304–16. The garbled 385–9 disappear. In 2.2,
          following porridge (493) comes
          the setting of the jokes on time and baldness (494–502), though the lines are not canceled as they are for
          all the other songs. The scene ends with Am I on Earth, set from
            608–12.

        Act 3.1 is the last before the interval; cuts include 713–14, 725–6, 756–7, 762–3, 766–7. The pattern of cutting, usually
          involving no more than a single obscure speech, continues in the second part. Antipholus’s
          wooing of Luciana provides Why Call You Me Love, a duet setting
          of 839–60. S.
          Antipholus’s wondering report of his treatment in Ephesus (1184–94) is set as Everywhere I Go. In 4.4, E. Dromio’s lament over his unceasing punishment (1310–20) is set as Beats Me. Lines 1414–15 are bracketed, with Pinch Song and
            Dance written opposite them. Act 5 stands nearly untouched. Of the cuts,
            the Diall points at fiue (1587), cut by Smock Alley but then allowed to stand until Komisarjevsky (whose
          set prominently features a clock), must seem unintelligible; and Egeon’s complaint about
          the transforming power of age (1788–98) might cause unwanted merriment and is usually trimmed, from Smock Alley
          onward. Opposite Thirtie three (1890) is a firmly written 25. The last song is Hand in Hand (1917–19).

        These prompt-books record the theatrical tastes of their eras, from a time beginning in
          the Restoration, when Err. could be cut to the barest of bones
          and serve as an after-piece lasting less than an hour, to Hull’s 18th-c. rewriting to make
          up for Sh.’s perceived deficiencies, to an increasing willingness to accept the play as it
          appears in F1. In this history, Err.’s fate is
          no, or not much, different from those of Sh.’s other plays.
