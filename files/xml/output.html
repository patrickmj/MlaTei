      <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Irregular, Doubtful, and Emended <br/>Accidentals in F1</h4>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The following emendations made in the Variorum text correct obvious typographical
        irregularities in F1. Mistakes that produce English words are not recorded
        here, but they are in the historical collation. In each note the lemma is the emended
        Variorum reading, and the first siglum is that of the source from which the emendation is
        drawn, followed by the rejected F1 reading.</p>

        <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Authorship</h4>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Though there has been spotty resistance to attributing all of <i>Err.</i> to Sh., the consensus is that he wrote it as we have it in F. The
          following raise doubts:</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_ritj0001" class="ref bibl">Ritson</a> (in <a href="#s_v1793" class="ref witness">Steevens</a>, ed. 1793,
          7:209): This comedy though boasting the embellishments of our author’s genius, in
            additional words, lines, speeches, and scenes, was not originally his, but proceeded
            from some inferior playwright, who was capable of reading the <i>Menæchmi</i>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_v1793" class="ref witness">Steevens</a> (ed.
          1793, 7:316): On a careful revision of the foregoing scenes [he apparently refers
            to the whole play], I do not hesitate to pronounce them the composition of two very
            unequal writers. Shakspeare had undoubtedly a share in them; but that the entire play
            was no work of his, is an opinion which (as Benedick says): fire cannot melt out
              of me; I will die in it at the stake.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_v1821" class="ref witness">Boswell</a> (ed.
          1821, 1:15), transcribing <a href="#s_pope1" class="ref witness">Pope</a>’s preface (ed. 1725, 1:xx): And I should conjecture of some
            of the others (particularly Love’s Labour’s Lost, The Winter’s Tale, Comedy of Errors,
            and Titus Andronicus,) that only some characters, single scenes, or perhaps a few
            particular passages, were of his hand. Pope does not include <i>Err.</i>; whether it was added by <a href="#b_male0001" class="ref bibl">Malone</a> or Boswell is not known.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">This mistake is noted by <a href="#b_eict1903" class="ref bibl">Eichhoff</a> (1903, p. 32 n.), who, however, accepts <a href="#s_pope1" class="ref witness">Pope</a>’s notion that all the plays printed
          in F suffer from an accretion of actors’ additions to the playhouse manuscripts over a
          period of years. Thus Pope accounts for much of what he thought was unworthy of Sh.
          Eichhoff attempts to locate and account for all such interpolations in
            <i>Err.</i> He ascribes 366 lines to this or these interpolators,
          including much of the low comedy of the Dromios and all the Courtesan’s lines, as having
          been added to please the populace. It is, for example, unthinkable that distinguished
          citizens such as Adriana and the Duke would be seen talking to a prostitute in the
          streets.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Other critics who believe that Sh. adapted an earlier play include
            <a href="#b_olie1908" class="ref bibl">Oliphant</a> (1909,
          p. 349); <a href="#s_cam3a" class="ref witness">Wilson</a>
          (ed. 1922, p. 77; withdrawn ed. 1962, p. 65); and <a href="#b_robj1923" class="ref bibl">Robertson</a> (1923, p. 127), who writes:
            That any one should ever have seen a Shakespearean touch in any of it is a
            monition to us of the difficulty which faces every attempt to modify the temper of
            traditionism [he thinks Marlowe wrote the blank verse sections of <i>Err.</i>]; and <a href="#b_gawa1926a" class="ref bibl">Gaw</a> ( “Evolution,”  1926), who thinks that Kyd was
          responsible for part of the play and that Sh. wrote the Luciana sections.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The following anti-Stratfordians attribute <i>Err.</i> to various
          figures: <a href="#b_ther1901" class="ref bibl">Theobald</a>

          It is the fifth of the comedies. The first four were printed from transcripts made by
          Ralph Crane, and the next four, <i>Ado</i>, <i>LLL</i>, <i>MND</i>, and <i>MV</i> were printed
          from quarto copy. Since <i>Err.</i> was probably printed from Sh.’s foul
          papers (argued in detail below), Jaggard’s compositors encountered Sh.’s handwriting for
          the first time in setting <i>Err.</i>, which may account for some of the
          mistakes in the text. <a href="#s_cam3a" class="ref witness">Wilson</a> (ed. 1922, p. 65) raises the question of whether
            F1 was set from a quarto because he finds no instances of what he
          thinks were characteristic Shn. spellings, which would, he says, have been smoothed out by
          earlier compositors, but he dismisses the possibility in favor of his theory that copy for
          F involved dictation and annotation (see below). The folios of 1632, 1663–4, and 1685
          copied each other in succession without recourse to other printed or manuscript copy.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The play is divided into acts but not into scenes save for <i>Scena

            Clearly then copies 64 and 79 were among the first copies of H2<sup>v</sup>:5 to be printed and they preserve the earlier, uncorrected state of the forme.
            Proofreading of H2<sup>v</sup> must have been unusually prompt, for
            only two of eighty-two Folger copies of the page show the uncorrected

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">Hinman</a> (1963,
          2:389–92), using evidence drawn from rules, the misnumbering of p. 86 as 88, and the
          patterns of recurring distinctive type, demonstrates that quire H was set in the normal
          Folio fashion, that is, set by formes from the innermost to the outermost type pages, from
          cast-off copy, by compositors setting forme pages simultaneously. Quire I was set out of
          normal sequence (<a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">ibid.</a> 2:395–7): I3<sup>v</sup>:4, I3:4<sup>v</sup>, I1<sup>v</sup>:6, I2:5<sup>v</sup>, I1:6<sup>v</sup>, I2<sup>v</sup>:5, where I3–I6<sup>v</sup> contain <i>Ado</i>. Hinman has no explanation for this odd order of setting.
          Compositors C, D, and B set the play.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Each compositor normally set from his own type case and distributed the pages he had set;
            <a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">Hinman</a> calls
          these cases x, y, and z. He makes this analysis by observing the recurrence of battered
          individual types in successive formes and by charting the order of setting and of
          distributing the types back into their type cases (for <i>Err.</i>,
          2:388–97). He correctly assigns B’s pages but is uncertain about a few pages he thinks
          were set by Compositor D: H3, H2, H1<sup>v</sup>, and H1. He proved to be
          wrong about H4<sup>b</sup> and H2<sup>v</sup> as well.
          Further analysis by <a href="#b_howt1973" class="ref bibl">Howard-Hill</a> (1973), <a href="#b_ocoj1975" class="ref bibl">O’Connor</a> (1975), and <a href="#b_werp1982" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> (1982) has apparently settled the compositors’
          stints. I use Werstine’s case designations (r, s, t) because Hinman could not identify the
          cases correctly until quire I. Formes in parentheses indicate the setting of <i>Ado</i>.</p>

          determined the order of printing and made what compositorial assignments he could, others
          turned to solving the questions he candidly raised, especially about printing the
          comedies, undertaken in Jaggard’s printing house simultaneously with the printing of
          Thomas Wilson’s <i>Christian Dictionary</i> (1622) (1:343–6).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_mckd1984 #b_mckd1969" class="ref bibl">McKenzie</a> (1969 and 1984) has attacked the enterprise of inferring much
          about the order of printing as detailed by Hinman, or detecting spacing preferences such
          as Howard-Hill and others have done. He in turn has been opposed by <a href="#b_jacm1987" class="ref bibl">Jackson</a> (1987) and <a href="#b_tang1991" class="ref bibl">Tanselle</a> (1991), who
          judge that the force of corroborative evidence of various kinds brings assurance of
          validity.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The work on the compositors done by <a href="#b_wile1932" class="ref bibl">Willoughby</a> (1932), <a href="#b_wala1953" class="ref bibl">Walker</a> (1953), and <a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">Hinman</a> (1963) was refined by <a href="#b_howt1973" class="ref bibl">Howard-Hill</a> (1973),
            <a href="#b_ocoj1975" class="ref bibl">O’Connor</a> (1975),
            <a href="#b_reis1976" class="ref bibl">Reid</a> (1976), and
            <a href="#b_werp1982" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> (1982),
          who have settled the stints of these three in <i>Err.</i> The earlier
          spelling tests showed Compositor B’s preference for spelling <i>do</i>,
            <i>go</i>, <i>heere</i>. His reputation as a bad
          typesetter of Sh.’s plays (Walker) has been rehabilitated by Werstine, and now he is
          regarded as one of the best who worked on F. Reid expands the list of B’s spelling
          preferences. Hinman (1:193–6) first identifies Compositor C as a <i>doe</i>, <i>goe</i>, <i>here</i> speller, and
          (1:196–7) Compositor D as one who slightly prefers <i>doe</i>-<i>goe</i> to <i>do</i>-<i>go</i>, and
          strongly prefers <i>here</i>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_howt1973" class="ref bibl">Howard-Hill</a>
          expands the typesetting habits beyond <a href="#b_wala1953" class="ref bibl">Walker</a>’s simple spelling tests. He adds to the list of
          spelling preferences and shows that compositors treated spaced and unspaced commas in
          short lines and at the ends of lines in distinguishable ways. He also (p. 71) notices that
            there are occasions on which compositors, obliged to turn over a line of verse
            which was too long for their measure, and unable or unwilling to set it as a turn-down
            or turn-up at the right margin of the column, have carried the remaining part of the
            line on to the next line. Often these have been indented from the left-hand
            margin. These lines he calls indented turn-overs. He gives the
          following table of indented turnovers up to <i>WT</i>: 
            
              Compositor
              B
              C
              D

              94
            
           On the basis of these preferences, he says (p. 72): It is therefore more
            likely than not that any page with more than one such indented turn-over was set by
            compositor D, and it is very unlikely to have been set by . . . C.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">These preferences show Compositor C at work in quire H on columns <a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">Hinman</a> is unsure about (H3<sup>a</sup>, H2<sup>b</sup>, H1<sup>va</sup>, H1<sup>a and b</sup>) and correct <a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">Hinman</a>’s attribution of H4 and H2<sup>v</sup> from Compositor D to Compositors C and D. <a href="#b_howt1973" class="ref bibl">Howard-Hill</a> does not use damaged-type
          evidence to corroborate his spelling or psychomechanical evidence such as spacing, but his
          expansion of typesetting habits greatly improves identification of compositors and their
          stints.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_ocoj1975" class="ref bibl">O’Connor</a> accepts
            <a href="#b_howt1973" class="ref bibl">Howard-Hill</a>’s
          reassignments except for H3<sup>v</sup> (he assigns it to Compositor C,
          not <a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">Hinman</a>’s and
          Howard-Hill’s D) and the last twenty lines of H5<sup>vb</sup> (which he
          assigns also to Compositor C, not D). He usefully invents (p. 89) the term indented
            flow-over for Howard-Hill’s indented turn-overs. Despite D’s
          clear preference for indented flow-overs—36 on H3<sup>v</sup>—O’Connor
          assigns H3<sup>v</sup> to C because he finds C’s preferred <i>you’ll</i> (<a href="#tln_0663" class="ref lb">663</a>, <a href="#tln_0692" class="ref lb">692</a>, <a href="#tln_0702" class="ref lb">702</a>) and the contractions <i>y<sup>e</sup></i>,
            <i>y<sup>u</sup></i>, <i>y<sup>t</sup></i> on that page; he accounts for the flow-overs as the
          result of tumbling-verse dialogue [in H3<sup>v</sup> and L6–L6<sup>v</sup>], where little or no room exists for a turn-over (p.
          90). This assignment of all H3<sup>v</sup> has not been generally
          accepted, but that of H5<sup>vb</sup>
          <a href="#tln_1235" class="ref lb">1235–54</a> to Compositor C
          has been. There O’Connor (pp. 112–13) finds <i>gon</i> and <i>wee’ll</i>, C preferences, as well as a failure to fill out line <a href="#tln_1234" class="ref lb">1234</a> with a short <i>And</i> for
          which there is room; he compares <a href="#tln_1200" class="ref lb">1200</a>, where
            <i>but</i> fills the line, and he argues that between <a href="#tln_1234" class="ref lb">1234</a> and <a href="#tln_1235" class="ref lb">1235</a>
          something caused Compositor C to replace D. Like Howard-Hill, O’Connor expands the number
          and range of spelling preferences that help identify individual compositors; like him,
          O’Connor does not use battered-type evidence to support his spelling preferences.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It remained for <a href="#b_werp1982" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> (1982) to test <a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">Hinman</a>’s battered-type tables to see whether they could
          corroborate the newly assigned compositorial stints of <a href="#b_howt1973" class="ref bibl">Howard-Hill</a> and <a href="#b_ocoj1975" class="ref bibl">O’Connor</a>. Hinman, believing that only
          two compositors set quire H (but open to the possibility that one or more other workmen
          participated in setting the quire), is puzzled by observing that types from the upper and
          lower portions of a preceding type page recur in the work of compositors different from
          the ones who set the preceding page; this means that compositors distributed parts of the
          same type pages, in a way unlike the normal Folio practice—normal after a few more quires
          had been set—of each compositor’s distributing only his own pages. Werstine, using the
          types identified by Hinman, confirms or slightly changes the stints analyzed by
          Howard-Hill and O’Connor; he shows that in fact from the beginning of Folio setting, three
          type cases were employed, the ones Hinman only firmly locates as beginning in quire K.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Case differentiation settles the <a href="#b_howt1973" class="ref bibl">Howard-Hill</a>–<a href="#b_ocoj1975" class="ref bibl">O’Connor</a> assignments of H3<sup>v</sup>
          (Compositor D) and lower H5<sup>vb</sup> (Compositor C). <a href="#b_werp1982" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> points out
          that, because no forme in quire H was set entirely by a single compositor, each
            forme provided an opportunity for simultaneous composition by at least two workmen and
            sometimes by all three (p. 212; he judges that all but H2:5<sup>v</sup> and H3<sup>v</sup>:4 underwent some degree of
          simultaneous composition).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He draws (p. 234) two major implications for editors and textual critics of the
            early Folio comedies. The first deals with cast-off copy for quires G and H. Ordinarily,
            as <a href="#b_hinc1963" class="ref bibl">Hinman</a>
            observed, when a quire was set in normal Folio printing order, there was need to cast
            off copy only for the first half of the quire, since the pages of the second half were
            set in their reading sequence [4–6<sup>v</sup>]. . . . However,
            simultaneous composition of successive formes of a quire—possible for quire G, probable
            for quire H—would have necessitated casting off copy for both halves of the quire so
            that compositors could work concurrently from separate blocks of copy to set pages of
            the second half of the quire. Thus editors must be wary of compositorial attempts to
            stretch or squeeze the texts of <i>MM</i> and <i>Err.</i> into the space available. One such attempt is evident in the last half
            of quire H at the bottom of H5<sup>v</sup>b, set by Compositor C, and
            the top of H6a, set simultaneously by Compositor B, where verse is compressed into
            prose. Second, identification of cases x, y, and z [his former r, s, t] in quires G–I
            confirms attribution of pages in these quires to Compositors B, C, D, and F. Editors of
            the Folio Comedies may then have greater confidence in using the available studies of
            compositorial accuracy in arriving at judgments about when and how to emend.
            (<a href="#b_werp2001" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a>
          [2001], doubts that Compositor F, supposed to have set pages of the four comedies
          preceding <i>Err.</i> from Ralph Crane copy, can be differentiated from
          Compositor D, i.e., he does not exist.)</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_werp2001" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a>’s
          example of verse compressed into prose on H5<sup>vb</sup>–H6<sup>a</sup> is weakened by observing how erratic that verse
          is (<a href="#tln_1254" class="ref lb">1254–8</a>; what did the
          compositors see in their copy? <a href="#cn_1254a" class="ref note_cn">see n.</a>),
          and how much white space appears in the SDs on H6. The evidence of compression on H5<sup>vb</sup> is the turnunder of (<i>sup</i>|<i>ping</i> (<a href="#tln_1248" class="ref lb">1248–9</a>)—one of only three turnunders in the entire play, one by each
          compositor—and, in the last line of the column, no space between the SP and the first line
          of a prose-lined speech, which is squeezed in when the last word <i>naile</i> might have been set on the next page. However, Compositor B’s H6<sup>a</sup> shows no sign of compression carrying over from H5<sup>vb</sup>. As Werstine argues, Compositor B was probably setting H6
          simultaneously from cast-off copy, leaving Compositor C to make all the necessary
          adjustments to get his allotted text into his type pages; nothing about the difficulty of
          reading printer’s copy can be inferred from how B set the top of H6.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Because the compositors are setting from Sh.’s MS for the first time, how they punctuated
          their stints proves interesting. If Hand D of <i>Sir Thomas More</i> is
          really Sh.’s, he punctuated very lightly; indeed, fewer than 20 marks appear in the type
          facsimile in <a href="#s_evns" class="ref witness">Evans</a>
          (ed. 1974, pp. 1686–96). Such light pointing would impede reading comprehension, so when
          such copy came to the printing house, it <i>is look’d on as a task
              and duty incumbent on the</i> Compositor, <i>viz. to discern and emend
              the bad</i> Spelling <i>and</i> Pointing <i>of his
              Copy</i> (<a href="#b_moxj1683" class="ref bibl">Moxon</a>, 1683–4; 1962, p. 192). Moxon goes on to say (p. 215): As
            he <i>Sets</i> on, he considers how to <i>Point</i> his
            Work, viz. when to <i>Set</i> , where ; where : and where . . . . But
            the Rules for these having been taught in many School-books, I need say nothing to them
            here, but refer you to them. If Sh. carefully punctuated <i>Err.</i>, we would expect the compositors to follow his punctuation in such matters
          as the use of colons, semicolons, periods, and capitalization after midline question marks
          and periods; they were expected to follow good copy <i>strictly</i> (p. 192). In too lightly pointed copy, however, they were to make
          sense of the text. What happens is that each compositor treats the pointing differently. I
          do not mean that each compositor parses his text in a distinguishable way but rather that
          each shows preferences in his choice of punctuation marks. The following chart shows how
          each compositor handles colons and semicolons between the beginning and the end of verse
          lines and within prose passages; how frequently each capitalized after internal question
          marks; and how often each capitalized after an internal period. The relative lack of
          midline punctuation in the figures below reflects the fact that in Sh.’s early blank verse
          the clause and the metrical line coincide most of the time.</p>

          Compositor B is different from them in the clause break: category and especially so in his

          was more nearly like C’s and D’s.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The charts below show the total SPs for the major speaking roles (Chart 1) and the SPs
          for the Antipholuses in the order in which the type pages were set (Chart 2).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The compositors set from cast-off copy, setting H3<sup>v</sup>–H4 first;
          that is, they started at Act 3; then Compositors C and D went backwards to the beginning
          of the play, and Compositor B went forwards to the end, save for H5<sup>v</sup>, which was set by the other two.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In this play with two Dromios and two Antipholuses, keeping the Ephesians and the
          Syracusans straight is useful, especially for a reader. So when D and C begin setting
            (H3<sup>v</sup> for D, H4<sup>a</sup> for C), they
          distinguish, though not consistently, which Antipholus and which Dromio is speaking. They
          probably had some guidance from their copy, but they apparently choose the form of the SP.
          Compositor D sets <i>E. Anti.</i>, <i>E. Ant.</i>, and <i>E. An.</i> 5 times (all in column a), and plain <i>Anti.</i> 3 times and <i>Ant.</i> once. By column b he has settled on
            <i>Anti.</i> and <i>Ant.</i> He distinguishes between
            <i>E.</i> and <i>S.</i> Dromio in 26 prefixes. When he
          sets H4<sup>b</sup>, however, he sets <i>Ant.</i> 9 times
          after an initial <i>S. Anti.</i>, and one <i>S. Dro.</i>
          to two <i>Dro.</i> Compositor C, setting column a, sets only <i>Ant.</i> and <i>Anti.</i> (He also sets <i>Iuliana</i> and <i>Iulia.</i>, apparently unable to read Sh.’s
          indication that Luciana enters and speaks. He gets the names right thereafter.) As C
          continues to set his pages, however, he always but thrice (<a href="#tln_0352" class="ref lb">352</a>, <a href="#tln_0355" class="ref lb">355</a>, <a href="#tln_0358" class="ref lb">358</a>) sets <i>E. Dro.</i> (6
          times) or <i>S. Dro.</i> (28 times) plus a crowded <i>S.
            Dr.</i>, and Compositor D thereafter fails to use the markers only 5 times (<a href="#tln_0179" class="ref lb">179</a>, <a href="#tln_0550" class="ref lb">550</a>, <a href="#tln_0868" class="ref lb">868</a>, <a href="#tln_0872" class="ref lb">872</a>, <a href="#tln_1136" class="ref lb">1136</a>), 2 of
          them at the bottom of H4<sup>b</sup> where he seems to be running out of
          space for the allotted words.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The Antipholuses are treated differently. They are hardly ever distinguished, as for
          example on H2<sup>vb</sup>, where Compositor C sets 17 <i>S. Dro.</i>s and 14 <i>Ant.</i>s (plus 1 <i>Antiph.</i>, 1 <i>Anti.</i>, and 2 <i>An.</i> in a
          full line and a catchword). Only in Act 5, when at <a href="#tln_1820" class="ref lb">1820</a> the brothers start appearing together, does Compositor B, or the copy,
          consistently identify them.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Since all the compositors follow this pattern of designating the Dromios but not the
          Antipholuses, they are probably following copy, where keeping the Dromios straight is
          important because they are the cause of so much confusion from 1.2 on. Compositor C sets
            <i>Antip.</i> at the bottom of H3<sup>a</sup>, having
          set <i>An.</i> six times at the top of the column; the speech,
            Plead you to me faire dame? I know you not, is the climax to Adriana’s
          attack on her husband for neglecting her, and the SP may well be authorial,
          though shortened to justify the line. Compositor C then sets H2<sup>v</sup>, with three <i>Ant.</i>s and one <i>E. Ant.</i>
          in column a, but then <i>Antiph.</i> at the top of column b before
          settling into <i>Ant.</i> (with one <i>Anti.</i> and
          another <i>An.</i> at the bottom of the column, set in a short line,
          followed by <i>An.</i> in a condensed catchword). These anomalous
          spellings come near the beginning of Compositor C’s setting of Antipholus’s speeches, and
          he may have been trying to figure out what the best SP should be.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Next (Chart 1), we see that all three prefer <i>Ant.</i> compared with
          B’s frequent <i>Anti.</i> and prefer or tolerate the shorter <i>Adr.</i> and <i>Luc.</i>, the forms that B much prefers.
          The first time Compositor C sets Luciana’s speeches (after recovery from calling her
              <i>Iuliana</i> in H4<sup>a</sup>), he
          sets <i>Luci.</i> (H3<sup>a</sup> and H2<sup>va</sup>); and the first time he sets Adriana’s speeches, he sets <i>Adri.</i> (H3<sup>a</sup>, 2<sup>v</sup>, except for one <i>Ad.</i> in a full line), but on H2<sup>b</sup>, the only other time he sets her speeches, he sets <i>Adr.</i> five times and <i>Adri.</i> another five,
          including a catchword. It is tempting to think that the long form is influenced by copy.
          Compositor D, however, strongly prefers <i>Luc.</i> and <i>Adr.</i> from the beginning.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In Act 5, Egeon enters, called by a number of variations on Father. He is <i>Mar. Fat.</i> (I1<sup>va</sup> in the order of setting);
            <i>Merchant of Siracuse</i> (SD, I1<sup>b</sup>); <i>Fa.</i> (4 [2f]), <i>Fath.</i> (3), <i>Father.</i> (in a verse line set as two prose lines), <i>Fat.</i> (1),
          all on I2<sup>a</sup>; and <i>Fa.</i> once again, in the
          next column. <i>Mar. Fat.</i> and <i>Merchant of
            Siracuse</i> look authorial, but the remaining forms are anybody’s guess.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Compositor B has been studied thoroughly, including his setting of
          verse as prose by <a href="#b_werp1978a" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> (1984), who does not study <i>Err.</i>
          because he deals with how compositors change printed copy in setting F, and how
          Compositors A and B demonstrate different lining habits. Compositor B’s tendency to set
          SDs flush right has been noticed, but no one has observed another punctuating habit, that
          of omitting periods in many SDs and, in <i>Err.</i> but not often in the
          other plays he set, at the ends of sentences that fill up his type measure. In the
          comedies, only Compositor B regularly omits periods in SDs; Compositor D does it once much
          later (Q4<sup>vb</sup> 456), and Compositor A also once (Aa2<sup>vb</sup> 452). (In the histories, Compositor A fails to punctuate just
          seven times; in the tragedies, when Compositor E appears, he fails to punctuate about as
          often as B.) These full-set lines lack periods: <a href="#tln_1111" class="ref lb">1111</a>, <a href="#tln_1388" class="ref lb">1388</a>, <a href="#tln_1398" class="ref lb">1398</a>, <a href="#tln_1562" class="ref lb">1562</a>, <a href="#tln_1597" class="ref lb">1597</a>, <a href="#tln_1851" class="ref lb">1851</a>, <a href="#tln_1901" class="ref lb">1901</a>.</p>

        
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">We saw above that <a href="#b_howt1973" class="ref bibl">Howard-Hill</a> and <a href="#b_ocoj1975" class="ref bibl">O’Connor</a> were interested in <i>indented</i>
          flow-overs as a way of distinguishing compositors. I am now looking at what happens when
          compositors do <i>not</i> indent turned verse lines. A feature of
            F1
          <i>Err.</i> is lines of verse set as prose, scattered between <a href="#tln_0347" class="ref lb">347</a> and <a href="#tln_1914" class="ref lb">1914–15</a> but clustering in the work of Compositor B (<a href="#tln_1335" class="ref lb">1335</a> through <a href="#tln_1916" class="ref lb">1916</a>), as listed below. In most of the instances involving
          10-syllable lines, one or two words are turned under at the left margin for lack of space
          in the first type line. To produce these flow-overs, all three compositors often set extra
          spaces between words and commas.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Likewise, variable spacing—compressed and expanded—is a standard way compositors meet the
          demands of fitting text into the space available. Expanded spacing is used to make space
          to fit in text that has been undercounted in casting off. The frequency with which
          Compositor B uses expanded spacing seems to have no bearing on this verse lined as prose,
          since he could have indented his flow-overs and achieved the same spatial effect.
          Compositor B expands normal spacing significantly more often than the others do,
          especially in <i>Err.</i>, where he is setting from a different kind of
          copy from what he had before. Here are examples of his practice, contrasting normal
          spacing with extra spacing. <p class="noindent">Free from these slanders, and this
                open shame. [normal spacing]</p><br/>
            <br/><b>Anti.</b><p class="noindent">Din’d at home ? Thou Villaine,whatsayest <br/>thou?

[extra] <a href="#tln_1356" class="ref lb">1356–7</a></p><br/>
          There is not quite enough space to fit <i>thou?</i> and <i>out.</i> into <a href="#tln_1352" class="ref lb">1352</a> and <a href="#tln_1356" class="ref lb">1356</a>, so Compositor B adds spaces to justify the line before
          going on.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Compositor B does not try hard to fit the verse line into the type line by abbreviation:
          but see <i>husbãd</i> (<a href="#tln_1608" class="ref lb">1608</a>),
            <i>y</i><sup>t</sup> (a logotype, the <i>t</i> above the cleft of the <i>y</i>) (<a href="#tln_1673" class="ref lb">1673</a>), and <i>&amp;</i> (<a href="#tln_1909" class="ref lb">1909</a>), as well as the missing periods noted above. This list
          does not include SDs set flush with the right margin, which he punctuates with periods
          about half the time (8 of 15).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Compositor D abbreviates when he can: If y<sup>e</sup> skin were parchment, &amp; y<sup>e</sup>
              blows you gaue were ink, (<a href="#tln_0631" class="ref lb">631</a>,
            with two logotypes); <i>countermãds</i> (<a href="#tln_1146" class="ref lb">1146</a>), <i>Iudgmẽt</i> (<a href="#tln_1149" class="ref lb">1149</a>), <i>hel</i> (<a href="#tln_1149" class="ref lb">1149</a>).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The single certain example from Compositor C’s work (<a href="#tln_0442" class="ref lb">442–4</a>) is slightly different; see the
          discussion below: <b>S.Dro.</b><p class="noindent">Was there euer anie

                the why and the wherefore,is neither <br/>rime nor reason. Well
                sir,I thanke you.</p><br/></p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In the Folio pages set before <i>Err.</i>, I find two instances of
          these open-spacing practices, both in the work of Compositor B in <i>MM</i>: at F6<sup>a</sup>, 1251–2, in a passage of concealed verse
          lines 1249–61; and at G3<sup>va</sup>, 2200–1. There are a few in the
          remainder of the comedies: K6<sup>a</sup>, 2347–8, where Q <i>Ado</i>, printer’s copy for F, has verse; M3<sup>va</sup>, 2049–50, where Q <i>LLL</i> has one verse line; M3<sup>vb</sup>, 2112–13 and 2114–15, where Q <i>LLL</i>
          has verse; P6<sup>va</sup>, 2169–70; S6<sup>vb</sup>,
          1084–5; T3<sup>vb</sup>, 1896–7; X1<sup>b</sup>, 1500–1.
          Flow-overs of verse lines do occur, but they are either unspaced or indented, e.g., A1<sup>b</sup>, 66–7, unspaced; E2<sup>va</sup>, 1652–3,
          unspaced; E5<sup>va</sup>, 2389–90, unspaced; F1<sup>b</sup>, 83, spaced but indented; K4<sup>a</sup>, 1808–9, verse as
          prose copied from Q <i>Ado</i>; X2<sup>b</sup>,
          1719–20, unspaced.</p>

        
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The combined effect of these mislineations is that the compositors misrepresent the verse
          lines of their copy. The flow-overs produced by spacing are important because of editorial
          uncertainty about whether to treat the lines as verse or prose. Now, however, editors are
          justified in counting these prose-set lines as verse. There is some danger in not
          attending to these flow-overs. <a href="#b_eccm1980" class="ref bibl">Eccles</a> (ed. <i>MM</i>, 1980) does not note or comment
          on the two occurrences listed above, so a reader of his text would not know that verse is
          intended, and <a href="#b_spem1990" class="ref bibl">Spevack</a> (ed. <i>Ant.</i>, 1990) has the same failing at
          TLN <a href="#tln_0024" class="ref lb">24–5</a>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The following table lists the unindented flow-overs; the asterisk marks expanded

        <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">The Printer’s Copy</h4>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Commentators generally describe the text as an unusually good one. <a href="#s_knt2" class="ref witness">Knight</a> (ed. 1842, p.
          125): This copy presents many typographical errors; and in a few passages the text
            is manifestly corrupt. The difficulties, however, are not very considerable; and the
            original copy is decidedly better, for the most part, than the modern innovations.
            Malone, in adhering to this text, was more distinctly opposed to Steevens than in other
            plays, in which he has, though evidently contrary to his own better opinion, adopted the
            suggestions of Steevens and others, who introduced what they considered amendments, but
            which amendments were founded upon an imperfect knowledge of the phraseology and metre
            of their author. The rejections by Malone of the changes of Steevens are here made with
            somewhat more of pertinacity, and perhaps of ill-temper, than was common with
            him. For an example of Malone’s ill-temper, see n. <a href="#cn_0585c" class="ref note_cn">585</a> (<i>Sprights</i>).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_ard1a" class="ref witness">Cuningham</a> (ed.
          1907, p. xi) believes F was printed from Sh.’s MS. He notes that <i>Err.</i> has no names of the characters at the end as do three of the
          preceding plays, <i>Tmp.</i>, <i>TGV</i>, and <i>MM</i>: We are left to conjecture the reason, which was probably
            sheer carelessness, if not too rapid work, on the part of the printers, and the want of
            any proper supervision; since there is ample room for the names on folio 100, the
            concluding page of the play. The lists of dramatis personae were probably
          provided by Ralph Crane.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Approval of the text is borne out by listing the number of unquestioned or probable
          mistakes committed by the three compositors. Compositor C produces dittography at <a href="#tln_0020" class="ref lb">20–1</a>
            (any . . . any), at <a href="#tln_0154" class="ref lb">154</a>
            (helth . . . helth), and at <a href="#tln_0407" class="ref lb">407</a> (did didst). He gets pronouns wrong at <a href="#tln_0126" class="ref lb">126</a> (them for <i>thee</i>), <a href="#tln_0474" class="ref lb">474</a> (them for probable <i>men</i>), and <a href="#tln_0750" class="ref lb">750</a>, <a href="#tln_0752" class="ref lb">752</a> (your . . . your for <i>her . . . her</i>). He garbles <a href="#tln_0383" class="ref lb">383</a> and <a href="#tln_0385" class="ref lb">385–9</a>
          so badly that no one can figure out how to emend. He sets vp for <i>upon</i> (<a href="#tln_0105" class="ref lb">105</a>),
            backe for <i>barke</i> (<a href="#tln_0119" class="ref lb">119</a>), too for <i>two</i> (<a href="#tln_0320" class="ref lb">320</a>), hundred for <i>thousand</i> (<a href="#tln_0338" class="ref lb">338</a>),
            trying for <i>tyring</i> (<a href="#tln_0492" class="ref lb">492</a>), ruinate for ?<i>ruinous</i> (<a href="#tln_0790" class="ref lb">790</a>), attaine
          for <i>attaint</i> (<a href="#tln_0802" class="ref lb">802</a>),
            not for <i>but</i> (<a href="#tln_0807" class="ref lb">807</a>), and do for <i>you do</i> (<a href="#tln_1243" class="ref lb">1243</a>). The dittographs and the garbling probably result from
          his characteristically attempting to memorize too much (<a href="#b_ocoj1977" class="ref bibl">O’Connor</a>, 1977, p. 60).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Compositor D’s mistakes seem to be the result of misreading; his substitutions are
          orthographically similar to what he misreads, hence he is easier to emend
          than Compositor C (<a href="#b_ocoj1977" class="ref bibl">O’Connor</a>, p. 61). His a riuall for <i>arrival</i> (<a href="#tln_0166" class="ref lb">166</a>), cooke

            (<a href="#tln_0285" class="ref lb">285</a>), thus for <i>ill</i> (<a href="#tln_0286" class="ref lb">286</a>),
            stranger for <i>stronger</i> (<a href="#tln_0569" class="ref lb">569</a>), free’d for <i>offer’d</i>
            (<a href="#tln_0581" class="ref lb">581</a>), a name for <i>an aim</i> [= ame] (<a href="#tln_0677" class="ref lb">677</a>), hope for <i>trow</i> (<a href="#tln_0693" class="ref lb">693</a>), bud for ?<i>bed</i> (<a href="#tln_0836" class="ref lb">836</a>), thee for <i>them</i> (<a href="#tln_0836" class="ref lb">836</a>), when for
            <i>where</i> (<a href="#tln_0844" class="ref lb">844</a>), and
            Thus for <i>That</i> (<a href="#tln_1160" class="ref lb">1160</a>) look like careless work rather than difficulty with his
          copy. To these may be added God sake for ?<i>God’s sake</i>
            (<a href="#tln_0258" class="ref lb">258</a>), sister for <i>sister’s</i> (<a href="#tln_0833" class="ref lb">833</a>), and
            ships for <i>ship</i> (<a href="#tln_1218" class="ref lb">1218</a>), all of which involve D’s characteristic trouble with
          initial and final -<i>s</i> (O’Connor, p. 67).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Compositor B sets is for ?<i>and</i> (<a href="#tln_0900" class="ref lb">900</a>), chalkle for <i>chalkie</i>
            (<a href="#tln_0917" class="ref lb">917</a>), depth for <i>death</i> (<a href="#tln_1590" class="ref lb">1590</a>). He makes a
          single pronoun mistake: their for <i>her</i> (<a href="#tln_0999" class="ref lb">999</a>). Oh, for <i>Of</i> (<a href="#tln_1109" class="ref lb">1109</a>) rounds out the errors that
          most editors emend.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Other possible errors do not draw agreement that they are wrong: me by
            (<a href="#tln_1042" class="ref lb">1042</a>), the first sir (<a href="#tln_1076" class="ref lb">1076</a>), glanced it (<a href="#tln_1535" class="ref lb">1535</a>), go (<a href="#tln_1895" class="ref lb">1895</a>), and the second Natiuitie (<a href="#tln_1896" class="ref lb">1896</a>) have all been defended; burthen
            are (<a href="#tln_1892" class="ref lb">1892</a>) is a recognized problem,
          but whether it should read <i>burdens are</i> or <i>burden
            ne’er</i> is undecided. Like Compositor D, B sets God sake (<a href="#tln_1498" class="ref lb">1498</a>), raising the possibility that both are
          authorial forms.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Some mistaken punctuation occurs and, as I have shown, quite a lot of verse is set as
          prose. But the small number of errors, and especially of those that defy satisfactory
          emendation, confirms the repeated opinion that <i>Err.</i> is a good
          text. F2 emends 13 of the substantive mistakes in F1
          that most subsequent eds. adopt, and F3 emends 3 more. Of course, there
          may be hidden, unrecoverable errors the compositors made but that make such good sense
          that they are undetected. The Commentary discusses all the certain and possible
          errors.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Until very recently, critics agreed that the play was set from Sh.’s
          autograph manuscript (foul papers), perhaps lightly annotated in the
          playhouse for performance purposes. But <a href="#b_werp1988" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> (1988, p. 244) advises caution: What then is
            the nature of the manuscript underlying the Folio text of <i>Errors</i>? This question, it seems to me, must go without an answer. His
          doubts are too recent to have influenced eds.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Evidence that Sh.’s own hand lies close to the printer’s copy, if in fact that copy was
          not his manuscript, comes chiefly from the SDs and SPs. These have usually been
          characterized as too confusing to serve in a prompt-book; see, e.g., <a href="#s_evns" class="ref witness">Evans</a> (ed. 1974, p.
          104), and, in German, <a href="#pw_rosk1982" class="ref bibl_pw">Tetzeli von Rosador</a> (ed. 1982, pp. 11 f.). <a href="#b_werp1988" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> (1988, pp. 239–40) believes
          that the difficulties posed by the variations may be overstated. The following are the
          inconsistencies usually offered as evidence:</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Merchant of Siracusa</i> (<a href="#tln_0002" class="ref lb">2</a>), <i>Marchant.</i> (<a href="#tln_0004" class="ref lb">4</a>), <i>Mer.</i> (<a href="#tln_0030" class="ref lb">30</a>),
            <i>Merch.</i> (<a href="#tln_0101" class="ref lb">101</a>) for

          must be granted that the various <i>Father</i> SPs would not confuse
          anyone, and some may be compositorial.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">There is a failure to distinguish two Ephesian merchants, the first at <a href="#tln_0162" class="ref lb">162</a>, the second at <a href="#tln_0981" class="ref lb">981</a>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Enter Antipholis Erotes.</i> . . . (<a href="#tln_0162" class="ref lb">162</a>), <i>Enter Antipholis Errotis</i> (<a href="#tln_0394" class="ref lb">394</a>). <i>Erotes</i>, <i>Errotis</i> are probably errors for <i>Erraticus</i>
          (wanderer). These are slightly misleading to a reader because they identify <i>S.</i> Antipholus, not his Ephesian brother. <i>Antipholis</i> is spelled this way by Compositor C only in a SD (<a href="#tln_0394" class="ref lb">394</a>), but he spells <i>Antipholus</i> at <a href="#tln_0505" class="ref lb">505</a> in dialogue. All but one—<a href="#tln_0273" class="ref lb">273</a>—of the variations (<a href="#tln_0162" class="ref lb">162</a>, <a href="#tln_0273" class="ref lb">273</a>, <a href="#tln_0394" class="ref lb">394</a>, <a href="#tln_0409" class="ref lb">409</a>, <a href="#tln_0786" class="ref lb">786</a>, <a href="#tln_0788" class="ref lb">788</a>) involving proper names occur in the work of Compositor C, as does the most
          serious garbling in the dialogue (<a href="#tln_0383" class="ref lb">383–9</a>), so it is tempting to suppose that C had trouble
          reading his copy. But the -<i>is</i> spellings must have been in the
          printer’s copy, because both Compositors C and D had correctly set <i>Antipholus</i> in H3<sup>v</sup>–H4 and H3 when they started setting
          the play, before the -<i>is</i> spellings on H2<sup>v</sup>, H2, and H1<sup>v</sup>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Enter . . . Antipholis Sereptus</i> (<a href="#tln_0273" class="ref lb">273–4</a>). <i>Sereptus</i>
          is probably an error for <i>Surreptus</i> (snatched away). This is
          misleading for <i>E.</i> Antipholus. It is amusing that the garbled Latin
          should just reverse the initial letters of the twins’ designators, though of course only
          readers (including compositors) would have to deal with the problem, as in the next
          example.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>E. Ant.</i> (<a href="#tln_0409" class="ref lb">409</a>), rather
          than <i>Ant.</i>, appears just once in 2.2. This is erroneous for S.
          Antipholus. Compositor C probably was influenced by <i>Errotis</i> as he
          noticed that <i>S. Dro</i> was being distinguished in the SPs.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Enter Luce</i> (<a href="#tln_0679" class="ref lb">679</a>),
          Compositor D. She becomes <i>Nell</i> in dialogue (<a href="#tln_0900" class="ref lb">900</a>, Compositor B) for the pun on her being an Ell and
            three quarters in girth (<a href="#tln_0901" class="ref lb">901</a>).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Enter Iuliana.</i> . . . (<a href="#tln_0786" class="ref lb">786</a>), SP <i>Iulia</i> (<a href="#tln_0787" class="ref lb">787</a>) H4<sup>a</sup>, Compositor C; Compositor D correctly sets
            <i>Luc.</i> in column b. Eds. have thought that the mistake lay in the
          manuscript, possibly reflecting Sh.’s uncertainty about what to call her, but this is the
          first page of the typesetting of <i>Err.</i>, and it is most likely that
          Compositor C misread his copy, whereas Compositor D got it right.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Enter Angelo with the Chaine</i> (<a href="#tln_0955" class="ref lb">955</a>), with SP <i>Ang.</i> to his exit at <a href="#tln_0972" class="ref lb">972</a>, near the end of Act 3 (H4<sup>vb</sup>, Compositor B). Beginning at <a href="#tln_0981" class="ref lb">981</a> (4.1) he is <i>Goldsmith.</i> His
          reappearance on stage after only eight lines following his exit is unusually soon in Sh.;
          I think it argues for a clearly marked pause in the action beyond what a scene ending
          might indicate. At the beginning of Act 3 (H3<sup>va</sup>, Compositor
          D), he enters as <i>Angelo the Goldsmith</i>, so the text is clear about
          his name and trade (that is, both are written down; the dialogue tells the audience the
          same facts). At the beginning of Act 4, Sh.—I suppose—chooses the term (<i>Goldsmith</i>) that he likes at the moment. Perhaps the shift from name to trade
          indicates a hiatus in the composition of the play?</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Curtizan</i> (<a href="#tln_1227" class="ref lb">1227</a>), <i>Courtizan</i> (<a href="#tln_1321" class="ref lb">1321</a>, <a href="#tln_1426" class="ref lb">1426</a>) and <i>Courtezan</i> (<a href="#tln_1497" class="ref lb">1497</a>) are given in SDs, but in SPs <i>Curt.</i> (<a href="#tln_1328" class="ref lb">1328</a>) and <i>Cur.</i> (e.g., <a href="#tln_1334" class="ref lb">1334</a>). These
          are minor discrepancies that cause no trouble. The conclusion to be drawn is that
          printer’s copy was Sh.’s manuscript.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Stage directions for entrances and exits are clear and reasonably complete. Some are
          indefinite or permissive directions, usually understood as indicating the author’s own
          hand in the manuscript; others are descriptive directions, usually understood as the
          author’s visualization of the action or else additions to the manuscript of performance
          activity. See <a href="#b_werp1988" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> (1988) for an analysis of the SDs that makes him skeptical that
          they can be used to identify with complete certainty just who is responsible for the
          wording; he quotes some of the extant dramatic MSS classified by <a href="#b_grew1931" class="ref bibl">Greg</a> in 1931 (<i>Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses</i> vol. 2) under the anachronistic
          term <i>promptbooks</i> to show that there are unclear SDs in them,
          sometimes because theatrical personnel left authorial SDs unchanged.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The indefinite directions include <i>Enter the Duke of Ephesus, with the
            Merchant of Siracusa, Iaylor, and other attendants</i> (<a href="#tln_0002" class="ref lb">2–3</a>), where the last two words leave the
          casting up to the resources of the acting company. Likewise <i>Enter
            Adriana</i>, <i>Luciana, Courtezan, &amp; others</i> (<a href="#tln_1497" class="ref lb">1497</a>), <i>Enter . . . &amp; other
            Officers</i> (<a href="#tln_1599" class="ref lb">1599–1601</a>). Last, <i>Exit one to the Abbesse</i> (<a href="#tln_1761" class="ref lb">1761</a>), where from a full stage—13 speaking
          characters plus others—there are plenty of people to draw from, but Sh. did
          not specify which one. Akin to these is <i>Enter three or
            foure, and offer to binde him</i> (<a href="#tln_1394" class="ref lb">1394</a>),
          where the <i>three or foure</i> is permissive.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Descriptive directions deal with props, stage action, and elaborations of characters’
          names (e.g., <i>Angelo the Goldsmith, and Balthaser the Merchant</i>—<a href="#tln_0617" class="ref lb">617–18</a>), matters that
          strictly speaking affect the audience rather than the actor, who is supposed to know who
          he is, what to bring on stage, and what to do once there. One cannot be sure whether such
          directions derive from the author or are records of useful performance experience.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Those involving props are <i>Enter Angelo with the Chaine</i> (<a href="#tln_0955" class="ref lb">955</a>), followed three lines later by, loe
            here’s the chaine, and <i>Enter Dromio Eph. with a ropes end</i>
            (<a href="#tln_1288" class="ref lb">1288</a>), followed by language making it clear
          what he bears. Both props have thematic importance, hence Sh. might be emphasizing them;
          yet the bag of coins S. Antipholus brings to Ephesus is likewise thematically important
          but is never denoted by a SD, as it might be at <a href="#tln_0170" class="ref lb">170–1</a> (There is your monie that I had to keepe. <i>Ant.</i> Goe beare it to the Centaure, where we host). In 4.2,
          where S. Dromio goes to fetch a purse of money to pay his master’s debt,
          <i>Enter Luciana</i> (<a href="#tln_1178" class="ref lb">1178</a>)
          might easily be completed, <i>with the purse</i>. Such lack of systematic
          identification of major, thematic props seems most likely to point to the author.</p>

        
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">As the play draws to its climax, stage action becomes hectic and the SDs grow more
          elaborate, beginning with <i>Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him:
            Hee striues</i> (<a href="#tln_1394" class="ref lb">1394–5</a>). <i>Enter Antipholus Siracusia with his Rapier
          drawne</i>, <i>and Dromio Sirac.</i> (<a href="#tln_1440" class="ref lb">1440–1</a>) marks the climax of S.
          Antipholus’s belief that he is besieged by malign forces he is determined to flee from. He
          and Dromio had exited at <a href="#tln_1263" class="ref lb">1263</a> after the
          Courtesan approached him; in the meantime his brother had been bound and removed to a
          madhouse, so the armed entrance is all the more alarming to the characters who suppose the
          madmen are loose. The SD seems to say that only Antipholus is armed, but the dialogue,
          with its plurals, makes it clear that Dromio has a rapier as well.</p>

        
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Their entrance precipitates the most perplexing direction in the play, <i>Runne all out</i> (<a href="#tln_1445" class="ref lb">1445</a>) and (two lines
          later) <i>Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted</i> (<a href="#tln_1447" class="ref lb">1447</a>). Such literary descriptions, common in play
          texts, are often regarded as evidence of the author’s own hand, but <a href="#b_chae1930" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> (1930, 1:306 f.) and <a href="#b_grew1954" class="ref bibl">Greg</a> (1942; 1954, p.
          140, and 1955, p. 201) believe that Sh.’s foul papers were lightly annotated by a prompter
          or book-keeper, Greg pointing especially to <i>Exeunt omnes</i> as a
          book-keeper’s mistaken addition. <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed. 1962, pp. xiii ff.) argues against them: It
            is reasonable to suppose that a stage-direction was somehow duplicated at this point,
            but the ready and easy way of accounting for what happened, by invoking a prompter, is
            not very convincing. At first sight it looks plausible enough to argue, as W. W. Greg
            does, that Exeunt omnes was added by a prompter or book-keeper on the
            left of the manuscript page, so duplicating the author’s original direction on
              the right, and that the compositor [<i>xiv</i>] fitted them
            together in the printed text. He went on to say it is possible that the similar
                Exeunt omnes at [<a href="#tln_1898" class="ref lb">1898</a>]

          However, Greg does not seem to have realized that the direction at [<a href="#tln_1898" class="ref lb">1898</a>] takes a common Shakespearian form, and is
            not at all analogous to the duplication at [<a href="#tln_1445" class="ref lb">1445</a>, <a href="#tln_1447" class="ref lb">1447</a>]; it is in fact
            paralleled by the direction at [<a href="#tln_1426" class="ref lb">1426</a>],
              Exeunt. Manet Offic. Adri. Luci. Courtizan. As for the duplication at
              [<a href="#tln_1665" class="ref lb">1665</a>], this may well be a compositor’s
            careless expansion of what was in the manuscript—perhaps Enter E. Antipholus and
              E. Dromio. In other directions of this kind both characters are usually
            identified as of Syracuse or Ephesus, as at [<a href="#tln_1440" class="ref lb">1440–1</a>], Enter Antipholus of Siracusia with his
              Rapier drawne, and Dromio Sirac., or [<a href="#tln_1811" class="ref lb">1811–12</a>], Enter the Abbesse with Antipholus
              Siracusa, and Dromio Sir., and it may be conjectured that here the
            identification of Antipholus has been transferred to the end of the direction. The
            phrase a School-master, call’d Pinch, . . . is probably authorial, and
            Greg could not see why Chambers wanted to invoke a prompter to explain it; but the
            reason is, I think, clear enough, and it is the same reason that caused Greg to detect
            the intervention of a prompter at [<a href="#tln_1665" class="ref lb">1665</a>] and
              [<a href="#tln_1898" class="ref lb">1898</a>]. Both scholars wished to account
            for the split direction and duplication at [<a href="#tln_1445" class="ref lb">1445</a>]; this could be plausibly explained by supposing that a prompter made an
            addition to the manuscript at this point; and this explanation would appear more
            convincing if the prompter’s hand could be found elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It was natural that, having discovered signs of the prompter, they should
            find him useful in elucidating other difficulties. However, there is no need to invoke
            him elsewhere than at [<a href="#tln_1445" class="ref lb">1445</a>], and this
            passage deserves further scrutiny, to see whether an alternative explanation may not be
            just as satisfactory. The fact that the passage in F is split between the foot of one
            column and the top of another needs to be taken into account. He suggests that
          Sh. wrote a single direction in the right margin of his manuscript (p. xv), but
            divided it because of its length into two lines, Runne all out / as fast as may
              be, frighted, then, in the accident of printing, and of the division between
            columns, the direction was split into two and attached to different lines. If so, then
              Exeunt omnes could be the compositor’s addition to make sense of
              as fast as may be, frighted.</p>
        
        

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">What accident of printing he does not say, but perhaps he was thinking of
          how a compositor might discover, as he transferred his block of composed type from the
          setting stick to the forme, that he had set too much for column a, and had to improvise to
          start column b, thus separating what had been a comprehensible SD. But again, this
          procedure hardly accounts for the fact that <i>Runne all out</i> is set in
          the empty space left in column a to match the space in column b used for catchwords and
          signatures. <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a>
          is misleading when he says the passage in F is split at the foot of one column and
            the top of another, since foot means the last line of type
          normally used in a type page for text. <a href="#b_werp1988" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a> (1988, p. 244) thinks the placement of <i>Runne all out</i> in the direction line is unique in F and continues:
            It would appear that Compositor B was ready to take extraordinary
            measures to avoid setting a marginal stage direction at the top of a column. For this
            reason, he would not have completed the direction begun at the bottom of column H6va
            with the top line of column H6vb. That is, if Foakes (and Greg) are right in believing
            that Shakespeare wrote only a single stage direction, it is probable that Compositor B
            would have split it in two to avoid the typographical blemish of a marginal stage
            direction beginning a column. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">My only reservation about Foakes’s account is the possibility that
            Shakespeare himself could have written both stage directions as they now stand.
                <i>Exeunt omnes, as fast as may be, frighted</i>
            closely resembles the following stage directions in the First Folio text of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>: <i>Exit Biondello,
                Tranio and Pedant as fast as may be</i> (TLN 2490), [likewise] thought to have been printed from [annotated foul
            papers]. In support of Sh.’s having written the SD is Compositor B’s preference
          for <i>run</i>, and the judgment that he sets <i>runne</i>
          under influence of his copy (<a href="#b_reis1976" class="ref bibl">Reid</a>, 1976, p. 131).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It may be noted that there is enough space in <a href="#tln_1447" class="ref lb">1447</a> to fit in <i>Runne all out</i> with the rest of the
          direction. The line would then run the length of the type line, and look like the SD at
            <a href="#tln_1497" class="ref lb">1497</a> at the bottom of the same column, <i>They draw. Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtezan, &amp; others</i>. That
          setting would be a simpler or, if not simpler, a more conventional one than the
          extraordinary measure Compositor B took.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> concludes
          (p. xvi): It is unnecessary to introduce a prompter . . . to account for the
            peculiarities of this text; they may all be explained in terms of an author inattentive
            to petty details, a printer who added act-divisions, and compositors who solved an
            occasional puzzle as best they could. He does not explain on what principles a
          printer would provide act divisions, a very doubtful suggestion.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Editors have been powerfully influenced by <a href="#b_grew1954" class="ref bibl">Greg</a> (1942; 1954) and <a href="#b_grew1955" class="ref bibl">Idem</a> (1955), e.g., <a href="#s_pel1" class="ref witness">Jorgensen</a> (ed. 1964,
          p. 26), <a href="#pw_kitg1966" class="ref bibl_pw">Kittredge

          p. 76).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Continuing with the descriptive SDs: <i>They draw</i> (<a href="#tln_1497" class="ref lb">1497</a>), part of the action continuing from 4.4 into the
          beginning of Act 5, falls into the same category of literary authorial descriptions.
          Perhaps slightly different are <i>Cry within</i> (<a href="#tln_1657" class="ref lb">1657</a>) and <i>All gather to see them</i> (<a href="#tln_1815" class="ref lb">1815</a>). The first prompts Harke, harke, I
            heare him Mistris: flie, be gone (<a href="#tln_1658" class="ref lb">1658</a>) and might indeed literally be a prompt inserted into the MS by Sh. or
          another, though it comes without warning to anyone holding the book, hence would be of
          little value as a backstage aid. The other direction, <i>All gather to see
            them</i>, comes when the Abbess brings S. Antipholus and S. Dromio out of the abbey to
          join their twins onstage for the first time. Such a clustering was inevitable, but the SD
          might mark a decision about how to block the climactic moment. <i>Enter the
            Duke of Ephesus, and the Merchant of Siracuse bare head, with the Headsman, &amp; other
            Officers</i> (<a href="#tln_1599" class="ref lb">1599–1601</a>), has, in <i>bare head</i>, a phrase so thoroughly
          integrated into the large entrance as to make it very doubtful that it is not authorial;
          besides, the direction is indefinite. <i>Beats Dro.</i> occurs at <a href="#tln_0418" class="ref lb">418</a>, where it is not necessary (take thou
            that, &amp; that) and at <a href="#tln_1327" class="ref lb">1327</a>, but
          not at <a href="#tln_1299" class="ref lb">1299</a>, where it might be most needed
            (And to that end sir, I will welcome you). (Pope adds it.) E. Antipholus
          uses the newly provided rope at <a href="#tln_1327" class="ref lb">1327</a>
            (Wilt thou still talke?). Such randomness seems authorial, though not
          irrefutably so.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Three directions apparently point to special staging effects, the use
          of three locales: the bay; the abbey; and the Porcupine, the Courtesan’s house. <i>Enter Dromio Sira. from the Bay</i> (<a href="#tln_1073" class="ref lb">1073</a>) is oddly literary rather than theater-based, for of
          course it means from the stage door that conventionally in this play is used for
            characters coming into Ephesus from the water-front. Through that door, we may
          guess, enter S. Antipholus, S. Dromio, and the Merchant at the beginning of 1.2. Through
          it S. Dromio may depart when he is sent to find out if any vessel is available for
          escaping from Ephesus (<a href="#tln_0937" class="ref lb">937–45</a>). If the inn called the Centaur is thought of as a seaside inn, Dromio
          goes through that door at <a href="#tln_0181" class="ref lb">181</a>, and his master
          and he use it at <a href="#tln_1461" class="ref lb">1461</a>. <i>Enter
            Antipholus Ephes. Dromio from the Courtizans</i> (<a href="#tln_0995" class="ref lb">995</a>), and <i>Exeunt to the Priorie</i> (<a href="#tln_1503" class="ref lb">1503</a>) are likewise literary, but they may mean that these
          locales were marked with signs. It is hard to imagine who but Sh. wrote those
          directions.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe</i> (<a href="#tln_1473" class="ref lb">1473</a>). <a href="#b_chae1930" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> (1930, 1:307) and <a href="#b_grew1955" class="ref bibl">Greg</a> (1955, p. 201) argue that <i>againe</i> means that the action is continuous from Act 4 to Act 5, hence
          that the act division is nonauthorial. <a href="#b_tayg1993" class="ref bibl">Taylor</a> (1993, p. 45 n.), arguing that F is printed from Sh.’s
          foul papers, thinks that the word indicates continuous writing rather than
            continuous performance and that the act divisions might well be authorial if the
          play were written specifically for Gray’s Inn.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Finally, <i>Enter Ladie Abbesse</i> (<a href="#tln_1504" class="ref lb">1504</a>) withholds the identity of Æmilia even from the first
          readers of the manuscript (and the audience) and from all subsequent ones. Sh. may, of
          course, be thinking of how the actor is to be costumed; or he may be thinking, as <a href="#b_mckr1935" class="ref bibl">McKerrow</a> (1935, p.
          465) argues, of her function as a peacemaker when she enters, especially as Sh. knows who
          she is. As with almost all the SDs, it is hard to imagine anyone but Sh. as being the
          author of this one.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Only one SD perhaps calls for an entrance at the wrong place, and that probably by no
          more than a single line. <i>Enter three or foure, and offer to binde him:
            Hee striues</i> (<a href="#tln_1394" class="ref lb">1394–5</a>) might be better placed, as with <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a>, after Adriana’s Oh binde him, binde him,
            let him not come neere me (<a href="#tln_1396" class="ref lb">1396–7</a>).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Unmarked exits occur at <a href="#tln_0361" class="ref lb">361</a>, <a href="#tln_0615" class="ref lb">615</a> (<i>Exeunt</i> perhaps
          omitted by Compositor D who had to use the last line in column b for the catchword <i>Actus</i>), <a href="#tln_1279" class="ref lb">1279</a>, and <a href="#tln_1581" class="ref lb">1581</a>, a very small number compared with most
          plays. Editors have expanded some directions, especially in 3.1, where the staging of the
          locked-out husband is so puzzling.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Err.</i> was revived for presentation at court in 1604 (28 Dec.,
          Innocents’ Day); one would think, although there is no evidence that it was or was not
          played in the intervening years (though <a href="#b_merf1598" class="ref bibl">Meres</a> names it in 1598), that a version of the play that has
          as many apparent puzzles in it as this version has could not serve the playhouse well.
          Recent scholarship, however, has made it clear that just such manuscripts did serve as
          prompt-books. It seems best to believe that the printers got Sh.’s autograph manuscript or
          a decidedly unmediated copy of it to set the Folio text. See also <a href="#b_werp1988" class="ref bibl">Werstine</a>’s warning,  above.</p>

          in the playhouse who wrote out the play as it was dictated to him from assembled players’
          parts, i.e., the roles of paper containing only the lines a single
          character speaks. Wilson found evidence for such dictation-transcription in
            auditory misprints, mishearings in the course of transcribing, e.g.,
            vnhappie a (<a href="#tln_0204" class="ref lb">204</a>) for <i>unhappier</i>, a name (<a href="#tln_0677" class="ref lb">677</a>) for <i>an aim</i>, burthen

          added most of the SDs to that transcript, though he did not bother to read it but instead
          confidently put them in, relying on his memory of an earlier version of the play, the
          (nonextant) <i>History of Error</i>, recorded once in 1577, which Sh.
          adapted by sporadic rewriting. <a href="#s_cam3b" class="ref witness">Wilson</a> (ed. 1962, p. 65) abandons most of his theory, but he is
            still inclined, however, to take the normal spelling and
              auditory misprints as evidence that the actual copy for [F] was not
            Shakespeare’s autograph MS but a transcript therefrom, such a transcript as might have
            been made for the Gray’s Inn performance or for the printers of [F]. Misprints
          like these may be caused by compositors’ carrying words in their memories.</p>

        that it falls between 1592 and 1594. The most recent study of Sh.’s chronology, <a href="#b_wels1987" class="ref bibl">Wells &amp; Taylor</a>’s (1987, p. 97), dates it 1594, associating it with <i>LLL</i>, <i>R2</i>, <i>Rom.</i>, and

            <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>
          </h4>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The first apparent written notice of <i>Err.</i> appears in <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>, an account of the Christmastide revels at Gray’s Inn
            in 1594. The Inn was a law school, one of several clustered together in London, that
            prepared young men for a career and offered them opportunities for recreation. One of
            these occasions took up the weeks between 20 Dec. 1594 and Shrovetide, the first three
            days in Feb. 1595; this extended party seems to have resulted from the long suspension
            of any revels, a hiatus caused by a bad siege of the plague from mid-1592 to spring
            1594.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Though <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> was not printed until 1688, everyone
            since <a href="#b_male1780" class="ref bibl">Malone</a>
            (1780, 1:103) first drew attention to it has granted the authenticity and
            contemporaneity of the account, which in somewhat sophomoric language tells of the
            revels engaged in by the law students during that holiday season, intermitted by
              the space of three or four Years, by reason of Sickness and Discontinuances,
            i.e., nonattendance (ed. Bland, 1968, p. 5). (For a full analysis and quoting of the
            relevant text, see .) The members of Gray’s Inn invited students and guests
            of the Inner Temple, another law school, to join their revelry on Holy Innocents’ Day,
            28 Dec., but either because too many invitations were accepted or because of
            gate-crashing, Gray’s Inn hall became overcrowded and the planned entertainment was
            abandoned after the visiting Templarians left in a huff. As a substitution, a
              Comedy of Errors (like to <i>Plautus</i> his <i>Menechmus</i>) was played by the Players. So that Night was begun, and
              continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and Errors; whereupon, it was ever
              afterwards called, <i>The Night of Errors</i> (<i>Gesta Grayorum</i>, ed. Bland, 1968, p. 32).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The play is assumed to be Sh.’s. <a href="#b_male1780" class="ref bibl">Malone</a> himself (above) thought that
            the reference in <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> was not to Sh.’s play, but
              was probably a translation from Plautus.
            <i>Gesta</i>’s like to <i>Plautus</i>
            probably influenced this judgment. Those who propose that Sh. wrote the play on
            commission for the Gray’s Inn revels must explain, as none of them does, how to deal
            with the statement in <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> that it was only on or

            Innocents’ Day (see <a href="#b_chae1923" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> below). <a href="#b_flef1886" class="ref bibl">Fleay</a> (1886, p. 125) notes that it is singular that
              the performance . . . should have also been performed apparently by the same company
              at Gray’s Inn, also on December 26th [sic]. It is unlikely that the

            though the Gray’s Inn performance would have occurred very late, since the Templarians

              men, and the Treasurer of the Chamber’s record . . . of a play at court by these men,
              as well as the Admiral’s, on 28 Dec. is a slip for 27 Dec., referring to his

            <i>MLR</i> 2 (1906, pp. 10–11). Halliwell-Phillipps produces a line

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The next reference to <i>Err.</i> comes in Francis Meres’s <i>Palladis Tamia</i> (S.R., 7 Sept. 1598; fol. 282<sup>r</sup>): As <i>Plautus</i> and <i>Seneca</i>
              are accounted the best for Comedy and Tragedy among the Latines: so <i>Shakespeare</i> among y<sup>e</sup> English is the most excellent
              in both kinds for the stage; for Comedy, <i>witnes his</i>
              <i>Gẽtlemẽ of Verona</i>, his <i>Errors</i>, his
                <i>Loue labors lost</i>, his <i>Loue labours
                wonne</i>, his <i>Midsummers night dreame</i>, &amp; his
                <i>Merchant of Venice</i>. Missing from this list (quoted
            here only in part) are versions of the <i>H6</i> plays and <i>Shr.</i>, plays dated earlier than the formation of the Lord
            Chamberlain’s men in mid-1594; they may not have been known as Sh.’s. But, if Meres
            intended to list all of Sh.’s plays to date, their not being named gives some added
            likelihood to the dating of <i>Err.</i> after 1592–3 when Pembroke’s
            men, who owned them, broke up.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">This list caused no comment when dating studies began because other commentators using
            internal allusions to contemporary events had already placed the composition of <i>Err.</i> well before 1598, including those who knew nothing about <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> with its 1594 date. For a brief time, however, a late
            chronology of the plays was postulated by <a href="#b_male1778" class="ref bibl">Malone</a> and <a href="#s_v1778" class="ref witness">Steevens</a>, based on Sh.’s dedication of <i>Ven.</i> (1593) to the Earl of Southampton: But if the first

              <i>Err.</i> 1593, and in <a href="#s_v1821" class="ref witness">Boswell</a> (ed. 1821, 2:295), changing the date to

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_chae1923" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> (1923,
            2:123), on the repertory of Lord Strange’s men in the 26-day season of Dec.–Jan. 1592–3:
              In addition, there were a comedy called <i>Cosmo</i>, and two
              new plays, [one being] <i>The Jealous Comedy</i>, which may, I
              think, be <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. A few pages later,
            writing about Pembroke’s men (2:130): He [Sh.] also wrote <i>The
                Jealous Comedy</i> or <i>Comedy of Errors</i> for
              Strange’s, a conjecture modified again (2:201): But they [the
              Chamberlain’s men] got <i>The Jealous Comedy</i> [from Strange’s
              men], if I am right in identifying it with <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i>. He fills out his thinking in 1930 (1:310): The <i>Comedy of Errors</i> might quite well be the gelyous
                comodey produced as a new play by Strange’s men on 5 January
              1593. . . . I am not sure that it was not. Jealousy is a sufficiently prominent
              motive (ii. 2; iii. 1; iv. 2; v. 1) to justify such a description from the inexact pen
              of Henslowe [<i>Henslowe’s Diary</i>, ed. Foakes &amp; Rickert
              (1961), p. 19]. On the other hand, it is a prominent motive in many
            comedies.</p>

        





        
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Lord Chamberlain’s Company, Founded 1594</h4>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_balt1927" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> (1927),
            and thereafter repeating his theory as a fact, says that the early comedies, including
              <i>Err.</i>, require only a five-man cast to cover the major roles.
            What he does not deal with is the difference in cast size that, as <a href="#b_wels1987" class="ref bibl">Wells &amp; Taylor</a> (1987, p. 95) say, separates the large number of dramatis
            personae of <i>Shr.</i>, <i>Tit.</i>, and <i>1–3 H6</i> from the smaller casts of most of the remaining plays:
              Noticeably, all five plays can be assigned, on reliable external evidence, to
              the period before 1594; all were performed, or at the very least might have been
              written in whole or part, before the closure of the theatres in mid-1592. Such large
              casts are also presumed in some other plays of this pre-plague period. . . . It
              therefore seems reasonable to suppose that these plays were written at a time when a
              playwright could count, as a matter of course, upon a company larger than the later
              Chamberlain’s men. This change in company structure cannot easily be dissociated from
              the devastating effects on the London acting profession of the long interregnum caused
              by plague.
            <i>Err.</i> can be played by 12 men and 4 boys (see ), a number that
            accords better with the smaller Chamberlain’s company than with the larger earlier
            company. (All the comedies, however, have fewer dramatis personae than the histories or
            tragedies.)</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_alep1929" class="ref bibl">Alexander</a>
            (1929, pp. 196–7) makes an important argument based on the plague of mid–1592 to
            mid-1594: The central fact round which the fragmentary information of
              Shakespeare’s early career in London must be arranged is the Plague of
              1592–[4]. . . . It is a safe conjecture . . . that the plays they [the actors] took
              into the provinces in 1592 they brought back again without additions to their number:
              a company on tour would have no need or desire to commission new work. Hence
            the plays known to have been presented just after the return to London must predate the
            plague.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The plays . . . which may on these grounds be dated before midsummer 1592 are:
                [<i>Err.</i>, <i>Shr.</i>, <i>Tit.</i>, (<i>197</i>) <i>1–3 H6</i>, and
              perhaps an early version of <i>Ham.</i>].

            clock time (two o’clock: 277; five o’clock: 189, 991, 1587) as particularly apt in 1594
            when, on 8 Oct., the Lord Chamberlain assured the Lord Mayor (see <a href="#b_chae1923" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a>, 1923, 4:316) that his
            players, who used to begin plays towardes fower a clock, . . . will now begin at
              two, &amp; haue done betwene fower and fiue, thus settling—at least for his
            company—a decade-long complaint that plays interfered with Evening Prayer and also
            released crowds into the streets after dark. Whatever Egeon’s fate, the audience
              will be able to reach home during daylight. Thus <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i> offers the City Fathers a dramatic model of faithful adherence to
              their demands and the audience some knowing amusement (1980, p. 348). If this
            is true, it means Sh. had only about two months to write the play before the 28 Dec.
            performance at Gray’s Inn—unless he inserted the clock times into an already written

              measure that he had first used in these poems, naturally presented itself to him in
              his first dramatick essays. Subsequent chronologies that call for dating some
            or all of these plays before the printing of <i>Ven.</i> must by this
            logic either date the composition of <i>Ven.</i> even earlier or see
            the elegant <i>Ven.</i> stanza as the product of Sh.’s precedent
            dramatic efforts or other literary models. Hyder Rollins (ed., <i>The
              Poems</i>, 1938, pp. 384–90), summarizes speculation about the date of composition
            of <i>Ven.</i>, ranging from 1580 to 1593, without settling the

            that opposes lust and love, the former leading to loss of identity, the latter to
            self-discovery and integration. The verbal similarities used to express this notion are
            so nearly identical that he thinks <i>Err.</i> was probably composed
            soon after <i>Ven.</i> (1592) and <i>R3</i> (1592–3,
            Uhlig following <a href="#b_chae1923" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a>’s chronology)—after because, he says, only
              <i>Err.</i> moves from how lust and self-hate confuse identity to

              1H6</i>, <i>Tit.</i>, and <i>R3</i>—have less
            rhyme than those probably written just after the theaters opened in 1594: What
              causes the sudden increase in the use of rhyme? Apparently, the event which
              immediately precedes that increase is the composition of the 1,194 rhymed lines of
                <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, followed within the year by composition
              of the 1,855 rhymed lines of <i>Lucrece</i>; at about the same time
              Shakespeare probably began writing large numbers of rhymed sonnets. No other
              explanation so readily and naturally accounts for Shakespeare’s fondness for rhyme in
              comedies, histories, and tragedies, all most probably dating from the years
              1594–5.</p>

              No one doubts that <i>Edward II</i> came late in Marlowe’s
              career, cut short on about 30 May 1593. His career in the drama perhaps did not
              continue beyond January, when <i>The Massacre at Paris</i> was
                ne [= new?] for Henslowe. During the rest of his life, the theatres
              were closed because of plague; one imagines him working at <i>Hero and

              for <i>Edward II</i> later than spring of that year. A date then of

              though not watertight case for actually placing the <i>Comedy</i>
              late in 1592, it harmonises with our hypothesis of 1592 or at the end of 1591 for

              Lost</i>. He believes that Sh. revised an earlier <i>Err.</i> and dates the revision between early 1592 and the end of that

            1962, pp. xxii f.): The play has particular links also with two other plays. One
              is <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>, which is set at the court of the
              King of Navarre, and is generally thought to have been written when Henry of Navarre
              was engaged in civil war with the support of the English government and forces, that
              is, between 1591 and November 1593, when support for him was withdrawn on his becoming
              a Roman Catholic. This play, however, has its own dating problems, for it seems to
              refer to the Gray’s Inn Revels of Christmas 1594, in which, as in the play, there
              appears a mock-embassy of Russians, and also shows signs of a later revision. The play
              which has the closest links with <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is
                <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>; there are many phrases, jests,
              and relatively unusual words, such as hapless,
              timeless,
              overshoes,
              minion,
              peevish,
              ruin­[<i>xxiii</i>]ous, and peasant
              (used of a servant) common to the two plays, and the vexing dialogue of
              the clowns, Launce and Speed, has connections with, and is similar in kind to, that of
              the Dromios, notably in such passages as the mock-inventory of the virtues of Launce’s
                mistress. . . . <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> has in common with
              these plays a use of doggerel couplets, and has connections with <i>The
                Comedy of Errors</i> both in the theme of the shrewish wife, Katherina, who is a
              type similar to Adriana, and in its indebtedness to George Gascoigne’s <i>Supposes</i> (1566) for many details; Shakespeare seems to have known
              this play of errors and mistaken identities when he wrote his own play of
              errors. But dating <i>TGV</i> and <i>Shr.</i> is likewise difficult.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            These linkages tend to reinforce the supposition that <i>The Comedy
                of Errors</i> was written not long before or immediately after the long spell of
              plague which caused all acting to be prohibited in London throughout most
              of . . . 1593. . . . It is not possible to be more conclusive than this.

            remarks on the similarity between the description of Doctor Pinch and that of one Jack
            Fitten, who does not appear in the play but is described. Pinch is a hungry
              leane-fac’d Villaine; A meere Anatomie, a Mountebanke, A thred-bare Iugler, and a
              Fortune-teller, A needy-hollow-ey’d-sharpe-looking-wretch (<a href="#tln_1714" class="ref lb">1714–17</a>); Fitten is A

              stormy brows, Long hair down his shoulders curled; His chin was bare, but on his upper
              lip A mutchado, which he wound about his ear (ed. Martin H. Wine, 1973,
            2.47–52). Both are leane-fac’d and hollow-ey’d; but the
            dating of <i>Arden</i> is as doubtful as that of <i>Err.</i> Wine guesses 1587–92, with a half-confident assertion in limiting
                <i>Arden</i> to 1588–91 (p. xlv). <a href="#b_balt1965b" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> (<i>Genetics</i>, 1965, pp. 18–22), canvassing all the possible combinations of

            the difficulty which Henri of Navarre experienced in attaining the French throne owing
            to his being a Protestant; he was opposed by the Catholic League, which forced him into
            exhausting and inconclusive warfare, chiefly in Normandy and Brittany, for several years
            after he was named heir to the throne following Henri III’s assassination on 2 Aug.
            1589. He eventually ascended the throne in July 1593, having converted to Roman
            Catholicism after his supposed bon mot, Paris is worth a Mass. In the
            geographical itemization, Dromio says he found France in Nell’s forhead, arm’d

              heir. Then <a href="#b_simr1870" class="ref bibl">Simpson</a> (1870, p. 38) raised the question of just when Navarre could
            have been considered heir, proposing that Henri was heir between 1584, at
            the death of the Duke of Anjou, next in line to the throne, and 1589 when he became de
            facto king: During the heredity of Henry of Navarre France was reverted, or in
              reversion, because her crown descended to a new line on the proximate extinction of
              the house of Valois. She began to arm for war against her heir in April 1585, when the
              declaration of the League was made. She was in the thick of the war in 1587, when the
              League fought and lost the great battle of Coutras. In April 1589, Henry III. and
              Henry of Navarre met as friends in Plessis-les-Tours. This indication therefore fixes

              not applicable to any Man of that time but himself, it is plain by the last <i>Stanza</i> that Mr. <i>Spencer</i> does not mean that
              he was then really Dead, but only that he had with-drawn himself from the Publick, or
              at least with-held his Hand from Writing, out of a disgust he had taken at the then
              ill taste of the Town, and the mean Condition of the Stage. Mr. <i>Dryden</i> was always of Opinion these Verses were meant of <i>Shakespear</i>; and ’tis highly probable they were so, since he was three and
              thirty Years old at <i>Spencer</i>’s Death; and his Reputation in
              Poetry must have been great enough before that Time to have deserv’d what is here said
              of him. Knight points to the trouble the players were getting into by the
              introduction of matters connected with religion and politics, referring
            to Lord Burghley’s instruction (autumn 1589) to Lord Mayor Sir John Harte to close down

            trade wars in 1589–91 that might be connected to Egeon’s being sentenced to death. (P.
            278): These allusions to the rivality of trade are so particularly marked, as to
              relate, plainly, to the commercial transactions of that eventful period. In 1589,
              Queen Elizabeth seized sixty ships, belonging to the Hans Towns, which were carrying
              warlike stores to Spain. In 1590, the Hollanders complained of the English
              depradations on their trade. In 1591, there were commercial complaints between England
              and Denmark. In this year, the English merchant-adventurers were expelled from
              Staaden; but were favoured by Elbing: Here, then, are the <i>adverse
                towns</i> [<a href="#tln_0019" class="ref lb">19</a>], which are so
              emphatically mentioned by Shakspeare. Add to those applicable facts, that the Lord
              Admiral was commanded, in July, 1591, to arrest all <i>Hamburgh</i>
              ships, and [<i>279</i>] goods, for satisfaction of four hundred and
              sixty pounds to George Leate. These were all very striking events to a commercial
              city, which, when mentioned by the poet, must have been felt by the inhabitants of
              London: And, those facts, when coupled with the allusion to the repugnance of France
              to Henry IV, fix the time, when this Comedy of Errors was written, to
            1591.</p>

              made a great stir in the Star Chamber in the years 1591–1592. Hearing that his son had
              disposed of a gold chain to a goldsmith named Underwood, he sent for the goldsmith and
              terrified him into handing over the chain, which he put into his pocket and refused to
              give back. The goldsmith complained to the Star Chamber, with the result that the
              episode made a noise in Westminster Hall, of which the <i>Comedy of

              began with the loan of the gold chain about two years since. Presumably
              the scandal was already the talk of the town in the winter of 1589–90. The

            Sh. was referring to the topography of Holywell Priory, a Benedictine nunnery near the
            Curtain and the Theater, where both Lord Strange’s men and the Admiral’s men were
            performing late in 1589: Thus it would appear that this allusion [<a href="#tln_1588" class="ref lb">1588–91</a>] was written
              for a performance at one of these buildings. If so, the whole conclusion of the play,
              centering as it does around the Priory, was written for this performance. . . . We
              should [<i>xv</i>] thus on this evidence date the planning and
              completion of the fifth act as not earlier than November 5, 1589, when
            Strange’s men apparently had to move to the Curtain from the Cross Keys Inn, nor
              later than November, 1590, which again confirms our date of Christmas
              1589–1590.
            <a href="#b_balt1931" class="ref bibl">Idem</a> (1931, pp.
            129 f.) goes on to say that Sh. witnessed the hanging of a seminary priest, William
            Hartley, on 5 Oct. 1588, from a gallows erected at Holywell, near the Theater, and based
            Egeon on Hartley. Furthermore, Solinus bears some traits of Sheriff Hugh Offley, who
            presided at the execution: In life, we have two men opposed, Sheriff Hugh Offley,
              and the priest William Hartley . . . as in the picture we have Duke Solinus, and
              Aegeon. Duke Solinus of Ephesus was engaged in a mercantile warfare. Likewise, Master
              Sheriff Offley, a merchant of London, was accustomed to act the prince [he played
              Prince Arthur in archery shows in the late 1580s], was at the time considered a London
              champion against Spain, and was prominently engaged in a mercantile warfare which had
              grown out of the struggle with that country. Aegeon was a hapless victim of the
              mercantile warfare, with whom Solinus sympathized, but whom he could not alter the law
              to save. As a merchant of souls (a frequent figure with priests generally), Hartley
              was the hapless victim of the warfare, both mercantile and religious, with Spain. Him
              too Offley pitied; but could [<i>130</i>] not alter the law to save.
              In age and dignified bearing, the two sets of characters are alike.</p>

            (1950, p. 24) rejects <a href="#b_balt1931" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a>’s (1931) belief that Sh. utilized his
              impressions of Hartley’s hanging (see above) for the Egeon story to compose
            the play in 1589. It seems to me entirely possible that Shakespeare could have
              recalled the circumstances of Hartley’s death as late as 1592 or 1593, and I find it
              difficult to believe that the gentlemen of Gray’s Inn would have entertained their
              guests on a grand night in 1594 with a play staled by five years on the public
              stage.
            Staled by five years on the public stage is a little misleading, since
            the playhouses were closed between 23 June 1592 and about May 1594 because of the
            plague. McManaway incorrectly dates the second recorded performance 1598 rather than
            1604; he is probably thinking of Meres’s list (see ).</p>

            pp. 80 ff.) suggests that <i>Err.</i> formed one of a series of
            political advice plays peculiar to Inns of Court, and that <i>Err.</i>
            was perhaps written specifically for the 1594 Gray’s Inn revels. The topic to be
            addressed was the need to unify Scotland and England, something Elizabeth resisted:
              The revels of 1594/5 and Shakespeare’s <i>Comedy of
                Errors</i> manifest their authors’ [plural because she includes the <i>Gesta</i>] awareness of the specific political implications of such
              general moral and religious language, i.e., Eph.
              2:12–16, which speaks about unifying Gentile and Jew in Christ.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 81): The Gray’s Inn knights of the helmet might well have seen Shakespeare’s
              play and written a revels fiction with similar themes or they may have commissioned
              his play specially for the occasion. She remains agnostic, however, about
            whether Sh. wrote the play for the revels.</p>

          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Doggerel</h4>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">An aspect of the verse, the doggerel (<a href="#tln_0629" class="ref lb">629–744</a>, <a href="#tln_1136" class="ref lb">1136–77</a>), confirms early commentators in dating <i>Err.</i> among Sh.’s earliest plays. Doggerel (often spelled <i>doggrel</i> or <i>dogrel</i>), a word of unknown origin
            but associated pejoratively by <i>OED</i> with dog (<i>a</i>.: An epithet applied to comic or burlesque verse; or to
              mean, trivial, or undignified verse), was the chief medium for comic verse in
            the drama before the 1580s, after which prose influenced by Lyly took over for a while.
            Most of the doggerel in <i>Err.</i> occurs in 3.1 when E. Antipholus
            tries to enter his house for dinner with Angelo and Balthasar but is blocked by S.
            Dromio. Actually the doggerel begins at <a href="#tln_0629" class="ref lb">629</a>
            and is so powerful that it draws all the speakers to it instead of being restricted, as
            one would expect, to the Dromios. It ends, after a transitional rhymed iambic couplet,
            with a return to blank verse at <a href="#tln_0747" class="ref lb">747</a>. <a href="#b_blaw0001" class="ref bibl">Blackstone</a> (in <a href="#b_male1780" class="ref bibl">Malone</a>, 1780,
            1:103): I suspect this and all other plays where much rhime is used, and
              especially in long hobbling verses, to have been among Shakspeare’s more early
              productions.
            <a href="#s_mal" class="ref witness">Malone</a> (ed. 1790,
            2:203 n.) fleshes out the point: The long doggrel verses that Shakspeare has
              attributed . . . to the two Dromios, are written in that kind of metre which was
              usually attributed by the dramatick poets before his time, in their comick pieces, to
              some of their inferior characters; and this circumstance is one of many that authorize
              us to place [<i>Err.</i> with <i>LLL</i> and
                <i>Shr.</i>] (where the same kind of versification is likewise
              found), among our author’s earliest productions; composed probably at a time when he
              was imperceptibly infected with the prevailing mode, and before he had completely
              learned to deviate boldly from the common track. Examples in
            these early plays are <i>LLL</i> 2.1.194 ff.
              (692 ff.), <i>Shr.</i> 1.2.11 ff. (576
              ff.), <i>TGV</i> 2.1.133–6
              (528–32).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The notion that Sh. could write such mean, trivial, or undignified verse
            brought opposition. <a href="#b_ritj0001" class="ref bibl">Ritson</a> (in <a href="#s_v1793" class="ref witness">Steevens</a>, ed. 1793) objects to <a href="#b_blaw0001" class="ref bibl">Blackstone</a>. <a href="#s_mal" class="ref witness">Malone</a>’s note above is not acknowledged,
            perhaps because of a falling out between Steevens and Malone, and because of Ritson’s
            animosity toward Malone): I have much doubt whether any of these long
                hobbling verses have the honour of proceeding from his pen; and, in fact,
              the superior elegance and harmony of his language is no less distinguishable in his
              earliest than his latest production. The truth is if any inference can be drawn from
              the most striking dissimilarity of stile, a tissue as different as silk and worsted,
              that this comedy though boasting the embellishments of our author’s genius, in
              additional words, lines, speeches, and scenes, was not originally his, but proceeded
              from some inferior playwright, who was capable of reading the <i>Menæchmi</i> without the help of a translation, or, at least, did not make use
              of Warner’s.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Critics who for various reasons think that Sh. adapted an earlier
            but not extant play (see ) point to the doggerel
            as fossil remnants of it, or perhaps as conscious imitations, e.g., <a href="#b_colj1831" class="ref bibl">Collier</a> (1831, 3:62–3): The
              circumstance, that he borrowed certain parts from the old <i>History of
                Error</i>, will explain all that the commentators have said regarding doggerel
                [<i>63</i>] verses, and the apparent authorship of two different
              persons in the same play. The doggerel fourteen-syllabic verses given to the two
              Dromios are precisely such as were used in dramatic performances not long before the
              period when Shakespeare began to write for the stage.</p>

            author thought his only business was to see that his plays pleased the
              people.</p>

                of doggerel couplets . . . which are identical in form with the typical metre of
                the mid-sixteenth century academic comedy, of which <i>Ralph
                  Roister-Doister</i> and <i>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</i> are
                the sole surviving specimens [Wilson, ed. 1922, p. 77]. I am at a loss to
              find any way in which these two plays may be said to be the sole survivors of the
              type. He refers to the plays quoted by <a href="#s_mal" class="ref witness">Malone</a> (ed. 1790, 2:203–4). In [<i>107</i>] more recent times, Mr. R. W. Bond [<i>Early
                Plays from the Italian</i>, 1911, pp. lxxxiii ff.] has examined this doggerel
              verse to show that it was the prevalent early comic form, and was being displaced only
              in the decade between 1580–1590 by prose under the example of John Lyly. . . . It is
              thus clear that Malone’s is the natural inference: that since this doggerel form is a
              survival from the earlier period, Shakespeare’s plays in which it occurs presumably
              belong to his early work. . . . The considerable bulk of doggerel in Shakespeare’s
              early plays makes it hard to avoid the conclusion that Shakespeare must himself have
              written some of this type. But if he wrote some, then there is as yet no evidence nor
              inference to deprive him of any.</p>

              times or less—and maps it by date, text, and speaking character. The results provide a
              new window on Shakespeare’s dual career as a writer and a man of the theater,
              revealing that his choice of words was shaped by his reading and by the plays in

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>133</i>] Shakespeare’s writing after 1594 registers

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The structural match between the recollected language of W. S. and
              Shakespeare can be traced back to the earliest years of Shakespeare’s career. For
              instance, the Egeon role, which Shakespeare appears to have studied as early as 1594
              and again in 1604–05 and 1612–13, supplies 11.9 percent of the rare words in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. Of <i>The Comedy</i>’s
              rare words that appear also in <i>Henry VIII</i>, 22.0 percent are
              supplied by the Egeon role. In other words, Shaxicon locates roughly twice as many
              Egeon words in this cross sample as would be produced by a proportionate distribution
              by character. <i>Henry VIII</i> is thus influenced by Shakespeare’s
              having learned the Egeon role. The role likewise influences other late texts. Of the
              rare words that appear both in <i>The Comedy</i> and in
              Shakespeare’s portion of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, 39.0 percent
              are supplied by Egeon, more than triple Egeon’s share of the lexical pool. . . . In
              comparison, Egeon supplies just 11.4 percent of the rare words that appear in the
              cross sample of <i>The Comedy</i> and Jonson’s <i>Every Man in His Humor</i> and [<i>134</i>] only 9.1 percent of
              the rare words that appear in the cross sample of <i>The Comedy</i>
              and Fletcher’s presumed portions of <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i> and
                <i>Henry VIII</i>. Clearly, neither Jonson nor Fletcher studied or
              memorized the Egeon role as Shakespeare did, i.e., neither of them wrote this
            role. (For criticism of <a href="#b_fosd1997" class="ref bibl">Foster</a>’s statistical methods, see <a href="#b_vicb2002" class="ref bibl">Vickers</a> [2002], esp. pp.

            doggerel, alternate rhymes, and rhymed couplets decreases from the first to the last
            plays, while alexandrines, weak endings, double endings, short lines, and the like
            increase (pp. 70–1). In a metrical table (p. 135) he counts 380 five-foot rhymes and
            1,150 blank verse lines, which place <i>Err.</i> third in the
              Plays of the first (rhyming) period, after <i>LLL</i>
            and <i>MND</i>, and before <i>Rom.</i> and <i>R2</i>, though on p. 25 he places it second, between <i>LLL</i> and <i>MND.</i></p>

            1882, pp. 41, 43): Light and weak endings increase with time. To the former class

              fugitive and evanescent in character, including such words as <i>and</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>if</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>of</i>, <i>or</i>. Now weak endings hardly appear in Shakspere’s early or middle
              plays. The <i>Errors</i> and <i>The Two Gentlemen of

            time. (P. 43): If double endings are rare, we may infer that the play is of early
              date; if they are numerous, that the play is one of Shakspere’s middle or later

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Critics who see a development in Sh.’s growth as a dramatist play-by-play, looking now at
          one aspect, now at another, usually grant that it is impossible to know the precise order
          of composition of the early comedies, but then construct one that supports their theories.
          Few attempt to give dates.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_dowe1875" class="ref bibl">Dowden</a> (1875, pp.
          56–7) lists <i>2, 3 H6</i>, <i>TGV</i>, <i>LLL</i>, and <i>Err.</i> as five experiments: The
            Comedy of Errors [is] a comedy of incident, of almost farcical adventure—the sole
            attempt of Shakspere at imitation of the comic drama of ancient Rome. In this [<i>57</i>] play Shakspere gaily confronts improbabilities, and requires
            the spectator to accept them. . . . Let the incredible become a twofold incredibility,
            and it is none the worse. We may conclude that, while Shakspere was ready to try his
            hand upon a farcical subject, a single experiment satisfied him that this was not his
            province; for to such subjects he never returned.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_dowe1882" class="ref bibl">Idem</a> (1877; 1882,
          pp. 37–9) lists impressionistic criteria for internal dating: (<i>a</i>)
          style and diction: In the earliest plays the language is sometimes as it were a
            dress put upon the thought—a dress ornamented with superfluous care. . . . Under this
            head of style may be noticed Shakspere’s early conceits, puns, frequent classical
            allusions, occasional over-wrought rhetoric (especially in the historical plays), all of
            which gradually disappear or subside. . . . (<i>b</i>) The growth of
            Shakspere’s taste and judgment. . . . [<i>38</i>] (<i>c</i>) In the structure of the play and grouping of characters there is, in some of
            the early plays, a tendency to formal symmetry, an artificial setting of character over
            against character, and group against group: Antipholus and Dromio against Antipholus and
            Dromio. . . . Afterwards the outline of the play is drawn with a freer because a firmer
            hand. (<i>d</i>) The characterisation changes. At first there are bright
            and clever sketches of character; . . . sometimes character is subordinate to incident
            (as in the <i>Errors</i> . . . ). By degrees the characterisation
            becomes profound and refined. . . . (<i>e</i>) The entire reflective
            power deepens. . . . (<i>f</i>) The imagination, which at first worked
            intermittently, leaving . . . spaces for the fancy to practise its slight devices in,
            becomes passionately energetic, of daring and all-comprehensive power. . . . (<i>g</i>) The sympathy with human passion and power of conceiving and
            dramatically rendering it in its most massive and most intense [<i>39</i>] forms increases. (<i>h</i>) . . . The humour of the
            dramatist, which was at first comparatively superficial—an enjoyment of amusing
            absurdity, with pleasure in the keen play of wit—becomes full of grave significance, and
            works in conjunction with his (<i>i</i>) Deepening pathos. . . . (<i>j</i>) Finally, in moral reach, in true justice, in charity, in
            self-control, in all that indicates fortitude of will, the writings of the mature
            Shakspere excel, in an extraordinary degree, those of his younger self.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_dowe1882" class="ref bibl">Dowden</a> knows that
          these matters cannot be weighed and measured but believes that the changes
          in Sh.’s verse admit of exact scientific estimations.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          (1) . . . At first Shakspere has his breaks and pauses at the end of the line—the
            verse is end-stopt; gradually he more and more found pleasure in carrying
            on the sense from one line to another without a pause at the end of the line—the verse
            is run on, and the breaks and pauses occur with great frequency in some
            part of the line other than the end.

            changed [from metaphors used to decorate rather than to define and illustrate thought as
            in <i>LLL</i>], approaching more nearly to that of Shakspere’s later
            works than in any other of the first four comedies, especially the blank verse passages.
            In the opening the Duke uses metaphors to express his meaning with greater force [<i>400</i>] than plain, straightforward speech could do; they give
            judicial weight. [Quotes <a href="#tln_0007" class="ref lb">7–14</a>.]</p>

          Ægeon’s long story is clearly and simply told, with a few metaphors to
            give it strength and vividness. Nearly all are personifications: We were
              encountered by a mighty rock [<a href="#tln_0104" class="ref lb">104</a>], is a good example of Shakspere’s later use of them, in which, by
            lending individual life to inanimate objects, or abstract qualities, he gives a force to
            thought or situation not otherwise obtainable. . . .

            Antipholus of Syracuse and Luciana, Act III. sc. ii., we get an artificial style, an

              with some show of blindness [<a href="#tln_0794" class="ref lb">794</a>],
            is a repetition of that line in a series of metaphors; as though Shakspere felt that
            lover’s talk required beautiful poetry, but could not yet adapt it to express all the
            throes, concealments, and confessions of the human heart.</p>

            treatment of Sir Eglamour or Thurio . . . with his development of Angelo in the first
            scene of Act IV of this play. Again his great gain in control of his material appears in
            his sure-footed movement as he threads his way through the confusion worse confounded of
            the last scene of Act IV and in his development of the last act. All that he was unable
            to do in closing <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> he is competent
            for in this play. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>140</i>] Indeed, so wise and so firm is the handling
            of the material in this adaptation [of Plautus] that one would almost be inclined to say
            a large part of its merit must date from the performance at Court in 1604, when
            Shakespeare had acquired his technique, were it not that the plays we are to consider
            next, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and <i>The Merchant of
              Venice</i>, give proof that shortly before their composition such work as this
            must have been possible for Shakespeare.</p>

          tables inserted between pp. 228 and 229) presents a chronology of the plays that, despite
          many repetitions and great elaboration, has not enlisted support. This chronology depends
          in part on his concept of how Sh. learned to manage the plotting of plays, discussed in
          the section on structure, . Baldwin’s
          chronology is as follows: <i>LLL</i> in its first version, winter 1588;
            <i>Love’s Labor’s Won</i>, an early version of <i>AWW</i>, summer 1589; <i>Err.</i>, winter 1589; <i>TGV</i>, summer 1590. The chronicles and early tragedies were, he says, written
          after these four.</p>

          proposes. At the end of a very long book, <a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Idem</a> (1947, p. 785) says that his true aim is to get the
          sequence of Sh.’s plays in order, not their absolute dates. But in fact he must make
            <i>LLL</i> depend on an amalgamation of <i>Endimion</i> and <i>Gallathea</i>, plays he thinks Sh. saw in
          London in the season of 1587–8, because <i>LLL</i> is his first play and
          so must predate <i>Err.</i>, solidly fixed in 1589. That the two Lyly
          plays were printed in 1591 and 1592 makes it imperative that Sh. saw the plays earlier so
          that he could construct <i>LLL.</i> (P. 623): The whole structure
            and character types and groupings . . . derived from <i>Endimion</i>
            and Shakspere’s company, with some structural assistance from <i>Gallathea</i>.</p>

            versification of poetry which is to be read, not spoken. It is the versification of
            Spenser, of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>Lucrece</i>, and it was some time before Shakespeare grew out of it. For one
            thing, it jingles prettily, for another, it helps to increase the speed. The actor can
            take the lines at a run. . . . [<i>141</i>] This might best be called
              <i>stanza movement</i> . . . . [<i>182</i>] Young
            poets, especially when they are writing to order and against time, use adjectives to
            fill up gaps. Shakespeare is no exception. In the <i>Comedy of
              Errors</i> we frequently meet with the familiar combination of two epithets and
            two nouns [quoting <a href="#tln_0054" class="ref lb">54–7</a>].</p>

            might be too piercing for so light a play if we did not know that presently all will be
            well. The style—of the kind that comes to sustained perfection in the <i>Dream</i>—is of the purest; and the verse, though still, and for long afterwards,
            moving within the bounds of the self-enclosed line, still runs over freely, the whole
            period being spoken almost in a breath.</p>

          observes Sh. trying to harmonize the elements of romance and comedy, the one requiring
          men, especially, to behave in conventionally loverly ways that the theater finds absurd;
          romance tends toward sprawling plots, comedy requires considerable shaping. Hence he
          speaks of Sh.’s recoil from the (p. 47) formlessness and the
            spinelessness of the thing [<i>LLL</i>] as a play to a
            discipline which, however uncongenial to the spirit, was a salutary apprenticeship to
            the mechanics of play-building.</p>

          219): This [early] style possessed its own merits and found expression, not only in
            diction and imagery, but in all other elements of dramatic art as well. Thus the
            artificial and formal quality of the imagery has its equivalent in the artificial and
            symmetrical grouping of the characters (e.g. in the <i>Comedy of
              Errors</i>). And the imagery’s tendency to typify and conventionalize rather than
            to individualize, to express commonplace truisms instead of unique experiences also
            corresponds to the whole manner and atmosphere of these early plays.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_half1954" class="ref bibl">Halliday</a> (1954,
          pp. 71–2): The earliest example of [the] extension of the harmony from the line to
            the passage as a whole is in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, III.ii,
            where Antipholus of Syracuse makes love to the bewildered Luciana. His speech is in
            alternate rhyme, and the assonance is emphasized by fixing it on trochaic words that
            immediately precede or succeed the middle of the line: Than our
              earth’s wonder; more than earth divine . . . [<a href="#tln_0819" class="ref lb">819</a>] <br/>To make it wander in an unknown field. [<a href="#tln_0825" class="ref lb">825</a>] [<i>72</i>] It is all very
            self-conscious and unashamedly undramatic—Shakespeare has forgotten the play in the
            excitement of the poetry—but it is a development of profound significance. As so
          often, development depends on the chronology used by the critic.</p>

              <i>A Comedy of Errors</i> [sic] and <i>The
              Shrew</i> with some of the warmth and eloquence, the surplusage of word-play,
            found in <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> and <i>Love’s
              Labour’s Lost</i>, the play probably belongs to the same group, though it may be
            earlier than these, for it treats its romantic theme with a somewhat jejune absence of
            self-criticism hardly possible after their delighted mockery of love.</p>

          pp. 9–10, 13): Since the working out of a complex pattern to its formal
            conclusion is an essential part of Shakespeare’s mature comic conception, we should not
            underestimate the importance of this exercise in plot-making to his developing
            art.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          Scarcely less important is the skilful use of different forms of verse,
            and where necessary of a contrasted prose, to point the contrasts which operate within
            the carefully contrived unity of the plot. The prose given to the servants, generally to
            convey a comic comment upon the way in which their [<i>10</i>] masters
            are behaving, stands out effectively against the stiffness of much of the surrounding
            verse. It can rise on occasion to a notable vivacity, as when Dromio of Syracuse
            describes for his master’s benefit the sargent of the band, the police
            officer coming to make his arrest: [quotes <a href="#tln_1206" class="ref lb">1206–11</a>]. The comparisons are indeed far-fetched in their
            variety, pressed too deliberately into use; but the vigour of the sequence, the firm
            grounding in situations seen and familiar, is of a kind that Shakespeare will develop to
            superb effect in his later work. Taken together with the lively use of the hitherto
            crude long verse line in a close chain of rhyming repartee (such as we find . . . in
            Act III scene i) and the solid construction of the blank verse whenever the play’s more
            serious moments require it, we must be struck with a facility, a fluent command of
            familiar modes of expression, that causes the play to stand out from its classical and
            contemporary models.

            early farces which, besides their own close relationship, are heavily indebted to
            Plautine theme and tone; and it is equally likely that <i>The Two
              Gentlemen of Verona</i> initiates in earnest the entrance of romance into
            Shakespearean comedy, henceforth to become its chief theme for which the dramatist is to
            fashion his own special structure.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Earlier, in his introductory chapter on <i>Err.</i>, <a href="#b_phip1966" class="ref bibl">Phialas</a> notes the
          additions of the shipwreck story and of Luciana as a romantic interest (p. 4):
            Shakespeare gave the whole a slightly new coloring by complicating its structure
            and by adding two new themes to the extravagant realism of the <i>Menaechmi</i>. One of these is the framing story of Egeon and Emilia, the
            accidentally separated parents of the lost twin brothers, which makes possible the
            general family reunion at the conclusion of the play. . . . The other
            addition . . . is the creation of Luciana and the episode of her wooing by Antipholus
            of Syracuse in [<a href="#tln_0787" class="ref lb">787–860</a>]. In view of Shakespeare’s later comedies this is a far more
            significant addition since love and wooing became the chief concern of those plays. In
            introducing these two themes Shakespeare attempted for the first time what he was to do
            far more adroitly later in play after play, that is, to present in meaningful comic
            relationship elements of romance and realism.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He recognizes that the date of composition is not certain, but says that he is more
          interested in the sequence in which the early plays were written than in absolute
          dates.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 6) <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> shares with <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> a boisterous farcical action as well as the theme of
            the shrewish wife, a theme the latter play treats far more extensively. Furthermore,
            while <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> deals with love and wooing in a
            single episode, <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> devotes its entire
            action to the wooing of the two sisters . . . although of course the wooing of the
            latter is of a special kind. In the third play, <i>The Two Gentlemen of
              Verona</i>, Shakespeare gives further prominence not only to wooing but also to
            romantic love which henceforth becomes the chief subject of his romantic comedy. This
            relative emphasis on wooing and romantic love in the three plays indicates strongly that
              <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> was almost certainly Shakespeare’s
            earliest comedy.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>9</i>] Shakespeare, then, whose development as a
            comic playwright is consistently in the direction of complexity or depth of
            characterization, deals with each of these levels of characterization. His earliest
            works, like those of his contemporaries, are essentially situation comedies: the humor
            arises from action rather than character. There is no significant development of the
            main characters; instead, they are manipulated into situations which are humorous as a
            result . . . of mistaken identity or slapstick confusion. Thus, the characters are
            revealed only in terms of what they do, outer action. The Antipholuses and
            Dromios . . . are cases in point, manipulated as they are amidst a confused wife,
            courtesan, kitchen wench, sea captain [sic], and goldsmith.</p>

          rhetoric to compose his first plays, is valuable and does not really need the priority of

          later. Similes are fewer, tending in fact to disappear; he counts seven similes to 112
          metaphors. Those metaphors (p. 157) have increased greatly, not only in quantity
            but in power too, and the whole poetic texture has become infinitely richer, he
          says, singling out Adriana’s reproaches in 2.1 and 2.2, the wooing of Luciana in 3.2,
          Egeon’s laments in 5.1, and Balthazar’s advice to E. Antipholus in 3.1. He dates <i>Err.</i> autumn 1591 (see Comparative Chronologies below).</p>

            upstart Crow attack of 1592, with its clear implication that its
            object is a Johnny-come-lately trying to imitate his betters, in reference to an
            established playwright with eleven plays to his credit, including the enormously popular
              <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, defies belief.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_ornr1986" class="ref bibl">Ornstein</a> (1986,
          p. 25): Since these plays [<i>Err.</i>, <i>LLL</i>, <i>TGV</i> in his order] are very different from one
            another in form and substance and seem to be discrete artistic experiments by a
            playwright still seeking his own metier in comedy, I see no point in arguing about their
            chronology. I begin with <i>Errors</i>, not because it is more
            primitive artistically than the others, but because it seems to me probable that
            Shakespeare began his career in comedy by imitating and adapting Plautus, and struck out
            on his own in <i>Love’s Labor’s</i> and <i>Two
              Gentlemen</i> after exploring the possibilities and recognizing the limitations of
            Roman farce. The fluent verse of <i>Errors</i> suggests that like the
            other early comedies it was written after Shakespeare had already served his
            apprenticeship as a dramatic poet in the Henry VI plays. . . . At its best the poetry
            of <i>Errors</i> has a colloquial ease and raciness that is not
            achieved in the history plays until the Bastard enters in <i>King
              John</i>.</p>

            Aduentures</i> (revised <i>STC</i> 709.5, dated 1594; entered in
          S.R. 7 Jul. 1576), a version of  “Apollonius of Tyre,”  and <i>Mother Bombie</i> (entered in S.R. 18 June 1594) and was then asked in the
          summer or fall to produce something for the Gray’s Inn revels. He prefers the order <i>TGV</i>, <i>LLL</i>, <i>Err.</i> Those
          revels were not settled on until Dec. 1594; see .</p>

          57): Although much of it is written in verse of considerable virtuosity <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is one of Shakespeare’s least obviously
            poetical plays. In it his verbal powers are fully at the service of his overall dramatic
            aims. Often the situations require no more than swift, economical writing, carrying us
            along briskly from one comic point to the next. But Shakespeare, already a master of
            dramatic rhythm, knew that the pace would become wearisome if it remained unvaried. From
            time to time he relaxes the pace of the ongoing action to allow the inclusion of
            passages of comic writing in which the situation is not advanced but enlarged upon. Such
            is Dromio of Syracuse’s brilliant description of the kitchen wench who, mistaking him
            for his twin, presses her attentions upon him: [quotes <a href="#tln_0886" class="ref lb">886–91</a>]. . . . [Dromio’s] comic
            catechism . . . preserves the comic tone while giving us a rest from following the
            complications of the action. Equally brilliant in a different way is Antipholus of
            Ephesus’s description of Dr Pinch and his efforts to cure him of his supposed madness:
            [quotes <a href="#tln_1712" class="ref lb">1712–17</a>].</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In its matching of style to content, its dramatic economy, its tautness of
            construction, and its bold interfusion of farce with romance, <i>The
              Comedy of Errors</i> has claims to be considered as Shakespeare’s first real
            masterpiece.
          <a href="#b_wels1994" class="ref bibl">Wells</a> places
            <i>Err.</i> in time after <i>TGV</i> and <i>Shr.</i></p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">On the basis of the <i>abab</i> rhymes as influenced by <i>Ven.</i> and <i>Luc.</i>, on the skillful casting for a smaller
          company following the establishment of the Lord Chamberlain’s men, and on the advance in
          character manipulation argued for by <a href="#b_bakg1907" class="ref bibl">Baker</a> and <a href="#b_wels1994" class="ref bibl">Wells</a>, I believe that Sh. wrote the play after he joined the
          Chamberlain’s men in mid-1594, but well before December. If he did use Twine’s <i>Patterne of Painefull Aduentures</i> (1594), as <a href="#b_colh1993" class="ref bibl">Cole</a> and others argue, that would
          settle the matter. The likely echoes of Marlowe, noted by <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> and <a href="#b_broh1968" class="ref bibl">Brooks</a> above, however, make 1592 a
          possibility, in the last few months before the closing of the theaters in May 1592.
          Likewise, the arguments for earlier dating by <a href="#b_balt1927" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a>, <a href="#b_phip1966" class="ref bibl">Phialas</a>, <a href="#s_evns" class="ref witness">Evans</a>, <a href="#b_turr1974" class="ref bibl">Turner</a>, and others have weight.</p>

      <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Sources and Influences</h4>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The commonly agreed on sources are Plautus’s <i>Menaechmi</i> and <i>Amphitruo</i>; the Bible, Acts 19 and the Epistle
        to the Ephesians (not certainly one of Saint Paul’s compositions); the liturgy; and John
        Gower’s  “Apollonius of Tyre”  (in Book 8 of the <i>Confessio Amantis</i>). Although <a href="#b_bulg1957" class="ref bibl">Bullough</a> (1957, vol. 1) does not include the biblical or
        liturgical passages, the rest are reprinted or excerpted by him: <i>Menaechmi</i> in the 1595 version of William Warner; <i>Amphitruo</i> in the translation of Edward Sugden, which lacks a passage known to Sh.
        included below; and  “Apollonius”  in G. C. Macauley’s ed., different
        from the lines included below. Warner is reprinted quite often, e.g., <a href="#b_hazw1874" class="ref bibl">Hazlitt</a> (1874–6), <a href="#s_ard1a" class="ref witness">Cuningham</a> (ed. 1907),
        and <a href="#s_ban2" class="ref witness">Bevington</a> (ed.
        1988). <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed.
        1962) summarizes the plots of <i>Menaechmi</i> and <i>Amphitruo</i>; he also prints extracts of Acts and Ephesians.</p>





      
        <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Titus Maccius Plautus</h4>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">While, so far as I know, everyone now agrees that Sh. read Latin well enough to study
          both <i>Menaechmi</i> and <i>Amphitruo</i>, there was
          a brisk debate about his ability that ran from the beginning of the 18th c. into the
          middle of the 20th c. Both the date of composition and Sh.’s reliance on Plautus are
          affected by how one decides the matter. The following summarizes the debate. Any
          uncertainty about Sh.’s Latinity was settled massively by <a href="#b_balt1944" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> (1944), who also presents the
          18th-c. positions with substantial abstracts (1:53–74).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Was Sh. a schoolmaster? <a href="#b_chae1930" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> (1930, 2:254) quotes John Aubrey, <i>Brief
            Lives</i> ca. 1681: Though as Ben: Johnson sayes of him, that he had but
            little Latine and lesse Greek, He understood Latine pretty well: for he had been in his
            younger yeares a Schoolmaster in the Countrey. &lt;<i>In margin</i>,
              from M<sup>r</sup> —— Beeston.&gt; Beeston is
          William, son of Christopher, a Chamberlain’s man with Sh. <a href="#b_adaj1923" class="ref bibl">Adams</a> (1923, pp. 94–5) champions this
          notion of Sh.’s occupation during the so-called Lost Years, between his marriage and the
          christenings of his three children in 1582–5, and 1592, when he is probably the object of
          Robert Greene’s attack as the only Shake-scene in a country in his <i>Groats-worth of witte</i>. <a href="#b_lang1691" class="ref bibl">Langbaine</a> (1691, p. 455): This Play is founded
            on <i>Plautus</i> his <i>Mænechmi</i>: and if it
              [<i>Err.</i>] be not a just Translation, ’tis at least a Paraphrase:
            and I think far beyond the Translation, call’d <i>Menechmus</i>, which
            was printed 4o. <i>Lond.</i> 1595. Langbaine seems to say that
          Sh. had enough Latin to make any use of Warner unnecessary, but his language is not as
          clear as one would like. <a href="#b_gilc1699" class="ref bibl">Gildon</a> (1699, pp. 126–7): I am of Opinion, in spight of Mr. <i>Johnson</i> [i.e., Ben Jonson], . . . that though perhaps he might not
            be that Critic in Latin and Greek as <i>Ben</i>; yet that he understood
            the former, so well as perfectly to be Master of their Histories. . . . [<i>127</i>] <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, a Comedy, <i>fol.</i> The Ground from <i>Plautus</i>, <i>Amphitruo</i>, and <i>Mænechmi</i>. He repeats
          and expands his opinion in 1710, p. 300. <a href="#s_knt2" class="ref witness">Knight</a> (ed. 1842, p. 129): The commentators have
            puzzled themselves, after their usual fashion, with the evidence which this play
            undoubtedly presents of Shakspere’s ability to read Latin, and their dogged resolution
            to maintain the opinion that in an age of grammar-schools our poet never could have
            attained that common accomplishment.
          <a href="#s_hal" class="ref witness">Halliwell</a> (ed. 1854,
          p. 445): [R.] Bentley, one of the publishers of the Comedy Mistaken Husband, 4to
            Lond. 1675 . . . thus alludes to the Comedy of Errors in his address to the
              reader:—the resemblance of one man to another has not only been the foundation
              of this, but of many other plays. Plautus his Amphitrion was the original of all, and
              Shakespear and Moliere have copied him with success.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Those who do not think Sh. knew sufficient Latin include the following. <a href="#b_cape1783" class="ref bibl">Capell</a> (1774, p. 70)
          speaks of the model he had to work upon, namely Warner, inventing an
          acquaintanceship between the two Warwickshire men, from whom Sh. probably gained his
          admirable knowledge of the classical unities. <a href="#s_v1773" class="ref witness">Steevens</a> (ed. 1773, 2:165) and <a href="#s_mal" class="ref witness">Malone</a> (ed. 1790, 1:289) likewise assume
          Sh. used Warner’s translation, perhaps because it circulated in manuscript before
          publication, as the title page says it did. <a href="#b_farr1789" class="ref bibl">Farmer</a> (1789, pp. 63–4), the most skeptical and
          persistent of the anti-Latinists: That the <i>Comedy of
              Errors</i> is founded on the <i>Menæchmi</i>, it is notorious:
            nor is it less so, that a Translation of it by W. W. perhaps <i>William
              Warner</i> . . . was extant in the time of <i>Shakespeare</i>; tho’
            Mr. <i>Upton</i>, [<i>64</i>] and some other advocates
            for his [Sh.’s] learning, have cautiously dropt the mention of it.
          <a href="#b_milj1885" class="ref bibl">Mills</a> (1885, p.
          189) in a lecture for the Bristol Shakspere Society, 24 Jan. 1885, denies that Sh. had
          read Plautus or Warner: Ben Jonson had read the <i>Menæchini</i>
            [sic; always so spelled in this report], and from him Shakespeare doubtless learned the
            incidents of the play.</p>






        
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">
            <i>Menaechmi</i>
          </h4>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Warner’s translation of <i>Menaechmi</i> was printed in 1595. Many
            early critics argue that Sh. used it as a source. Judgments about Sh.’s possible
            indebtedness will be found above, in Date of Composition. The translation is printed
            here as being the only contemporary translation and in lieu of the Latin that Sh.
            presumably knew but that most modern readers are unable to read. In the Commentary I
            have quoted <a href="#b_gile1930" class="ref bibl">Gill</a>’s (1930) parallels to the Latin play as an aid to those who wish to

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Warner’s translation follows the Latin quite closely in lively, idiomatic prose. He
            does not translate about 75 lines, spread out over the 1,162 lines of the Latin text,
            and gives brief paraphrases of two passages that total 17 lines. It is an eminently
            actable translation, but I have found no contemporary references to it. Warner
            bowdlerizes Plautus a bit by removing some lines of sexual innuendo and by translating
              meretrix and scortum as
              Gentlewoman or woman.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The quarto is well printed; a few editorial adjustments are in square brackets. So as
            to make placement of signatures and other references most visible, the text preserves
            the lineation of Q, except for sigs. A4 and A4<sup>v</sup> where a few
            lines are indented by display capitals P (A4) and I (A4<sup>v</sup>).
            Q’s conventional use of italic and roman faces has been followed, except that when the
            compositor(s) ran out of, chiefly, italic letters and substituted roman or swash
            letters, the fonts are normalized. Occasionally, punctuation and spacing have also been
            normalized. Signatures appear in the right margin. TLN references in the right margin
            are to the Commentary where Warner is identified or quoted. The text is taken from the

                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">First and foremost, spectators, I am the bearer of the very best wishes
                    for—myself and—you. I bring you Plautus, orally, not corporally, and I pray you
                    receive him with amiable ears. Lend me your attention and learn our argument
                    now; I will frame it in the fewest possible words.</p>

                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Now writers of comedy have this habit: they always allege that the scene of
                    action is Athens, their object being to give the play a more Grecian air. As for
                    me, I will report the scene as being nowhere, save where, by report, the events
                    occurred. And though this argument is à la Greek, yet it is not à l’Attic but
                    rather à la Sicilian. So much by way of antelude to this argument; now I will
                    give you your rations of the argument itself, not by the peck or three peck
                    measure, but by the very granary—such is my generosity in giving arguments!</p>

                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">There was a certain old merchant in Syracuse who had twin sons born him, so
                    much alike that their foster mother who suckled them could not distinguish them,
                    nor even their real mother who gave them birth—so I was told, at least, by a man
                    who had seen the boys; I myself have not seen them, and none of you is to
                    suppose I have. When the boys were now seven years old, their father loaded a
                    large ship with many articles of [<i>369</i>] merchandise; one
                    twin he put aboard and took away with himself to Tarentum, his place of trade,
                    the other being left with his mother at home. At Tarentum it happened they were
                    having a festival when he arrived. Many people had congregated, as they do at
                    festivals; the boy strayed from his father in the crowd. A certain merchant of
                    Epidamnus was there; this merchant picked the boy up and took him off to
                    Epidamnus. As for the father, after he lost his son he was broken-hearted and
                    died of grief at Tarentum a few days later.</p>

                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">When news of all this—how the boy was stolen and his father dead at
                    Tarentum—got back to Syracuse to the boys’ grandfather, he changed the name of
                    this other twin. See what a deep affection he had for that other boy, the stolen
                    one! He gave that boy’s name to the one at home, calling him Menaechmus, the
                    name of his lost brother. This was the name of the grandfather himself,
                      too,—(<i>confidentially</i>) I remember his name the more
                    easily for having seen him vociferously dunned. To keep you from going astray
                    later, I herewith forewarn you—both twins have the same name.</p>

                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Now I must (<i>chuckling</i>) foot it back to Epidamnus so as
                    to clarify this situation for you perfectly. If any one of you should want any
                    business transacted for him in Epidamnus, command me freely and speak out—that
                    is, in case you furnish the wherewithal for the transaction. For if a man has
                    not furnished the necessary funds, it will come to nothing; if he has furnished
                    them, it will come to—less than nothing. However, I return to the place I left,
                    yes, and without stirring a step.</p>

                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>371</i>] That Epidamnian I mentioned some time ago, who
                    stole that other twin, had no children at all except his money. He adopted that
                    kidnapped boy and gave him a wife with a dowry, and made him his heir by his own
                    demise. For he happened one day to be going to the country after a heavy rain,
                    and while he was trying to ford a rapid stream quite near the city, the rapids
                    rapt the feet of the boy’s abductor from beneath him and swept him off to
                    perdition. His enormous fortune fell to his adopted son. And there it is (<i>pointing to the house</i>) that this stolen twin lives.</p>

                  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Now that twin whose home is in Syracuse will come to-day to Epidamnus, with his
                    servant, in search of this twin brother of his. This city (<i>with a wave toward the houses on the stage</i>) is Epidamnus, during the
                    presentation of this play; when another play is presented it will become another
                    town. It is quite like the way in which families, too, are wont to change their
                    homes: now a pimp lives here, now a young gentleman, now an old one, now a poor
                    man, a beggar, a king, a parasite, a seer[.]</p>

                    Sessions are holden: there thru­ <br/>sting our selues into the prease of
                    people, when I was in <br/>midst of all the throng, he gaue me the slip, that I
                    could ne­ <br/>uer more set eye on him, and I dare sweare, came directly
                    <br/>to dinner. That I would he that first deuised these Sessions <br/>were
                    hang’d, and all that euer came of him: tis such a hinde­ <br/>rance to men
                    that haue belly businesses in hand. If a man be <br/>not there at his call, they
                    amearce him with a vengeance. <br/>Men that haue nothing else to do, that do
                    neither bid anie <br/>man, nor are themselues bidden to dinner, such should come
                    <br/>to Sessions, not we that haue these matters to looke too. If it <br/>were
                    so, I had not thus lost my dinner this day, which I think <br/>in my conscience
                    he did euen purposely couzen me off. Yet <br/>I meane to go see: if I can but
                    light vppon the reuersion, I <br/>may perhaps get my peny-worthes. But how now?

          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal"><i>Amphitruo</i> and the Supposita</h4>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed.
            1962, p. xxvii) summarizes the plot of <i>Amphitruo</i>:
              Jupiter takes the place of Amphitryon in his house, and sleeps with his wife,
              Alcmena, who believes she is with her husband. Meanwhile, Mercury adopts the
              appearance of Amphitryon’s slave, Sosia, and first confuses, then drives away the real
              Sosia. A little later, Mercury, still Sosia in appearance, abuses Amphitryon when he
              knocks at the door of his own house and is not allowed to enter. In this play there
              are two pairs of twins, masters and servants, who cannot be distinguished by their
              friends or by Alcmena.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">What has not been printed for about a century is an addition to the authentic <i>Amphitruo</i> to make up for a lacuna between 4.2.16 and the beginning
            of Act 5, a gap of about 225 lines. The addition, written by Hermolaus Barbarus, was
            printed in 16th-c. editions, one of which Sh. presumably studied. In Lambinus’s ed.
            (1576), which <a href="#pw_balt1928 #b_balt1947" class="ref bibl_pw">Baldwin</a> identifies as the one Sh. read (see n. <a href="#cn_0000" class="ref note_cn">0</a>), the first few lines are printed in italics, with a warning
            that the best manuscripts do not contain the addition, but that Lambinus intends to
            print the lines, siue sint Plauti, siue non sint. This
            addition came to be called Supposita in 19th-c. scholarly editions in recognition of its
            being a late, non-Plautine text, or else it was dropped as spurious, so that the lines
            have been ignored in more recent source studies. <a href="#b_gile1930" class="ref bibl">Gill</a> (1930, pp. 52–5): This reconstruction was made by Hermolaus Barbarus, Cardinal of Aquileja
              (1464–1493), to be used when the <i>Amphitruo</i> was played in Rome
              and Florence. . . . The author of <i>The Birth of Hercules</i>
              (about 1600) follows quite closely these reconstructed scenes, translating or
              paraphrasing the greater part of them. . . . [<i>53</i>] It seems
              very probable to me that Shakespeare was familiar with them. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>54</i>] In studying these characters I have
              suggested that the rôle of Balthazar . . . is not unlike that of Blepharo [quotes
                <a href="#tln_0755" class="ref lb">755–8</a> of the
              authentic text]. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>55</i>] The altercation over the closed door, the
              talk of sorcery and transformation, Amphitruo’s doubting his identity, and, more
              particularly, Blepharo’s activity as peacemaker, are suggestive of Shakespeare’s play,
              and of this interpolation.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The following prose translation (tr. <a href="#pw_plat1852" class="ref bibl_pw">Riley</a>, 1910, pp. 47–57) of the lines added to 16th-c. editions of <i>Amphitruo</i> is used because no modern editions include the Supposita.
            The addition begins after line 1034. Italicized words are not in the Latin, but are
            added by Riley to achieve clarity or idiomatic English. No standard line numbering
            exists; page numbers in brackets are those of the translation. TLN references inserted
            in the text identify nn. that discuss the Supposita. I reprint the whole passage because
            Sh. would have read it (in Latin) and because of its rarity.</p>

            <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">General Indebtedness</h4>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">To begin with Sh.’s debt to Plautus’s <i>Menaechmi</i> beyond the
              mere notice of additions and subtractions such as <a href="#pw_herw1870" class="ref bibl_pw">Hertzberg</a> (ed. 1870, 8:189)
              offers (wife’s father, parasite, cook, and maid missing from <i>Err.</i>; Solinus, Egeon, Balthazar, Angelo, the Abbess, Luciana, and
              especially the second Dromio added to <i>Err.</i>), the fullest
              exposition is <a href="#b_gile1930" class="ref bibl">Gill</a>’s (1930), which lays out the parallels so well that no one has
              had to redo the project. Her conclusion sensibly claims that Sh. (p. 59) seems
                to have assimilated thoroughly the two classical comedies; he has made a
                remarkable—probably unconscious—selection of details, has added to these some
                entirely new elements and a touch, at the beginning and the end, of an old tale, and
                has moulded the whole into an excellently plotted play. This modest
              description does much to deflect objections that she has found detailed influences
              which, if she were to have said they were entirely conscious manipulations of the two
              plays, would have defied credibility.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Whether Sh. used Warner rather than Latin Plautus causes comment, as the issue of
              Sh.’s Latinity mentioned above demonstrates. <a href="#b_ritj0001" class="ref bibl">Ritson</a> (in <a href="#s_v1793" class="ref witness">Steevens</a>, ed. 1793): I am
                possibly singular in thinking that Shakspeare was not under the slightest
                obligation, in forming this comedy, to Warner’s translation of the <i>Menæchmi</i>. . . .  He has not a name, line or word, from the old play, nor
                any incident but what must, of course, be common to every translation.
              <a href="#b_isah1884a" class="ref bibl">Isaac</a> (1884,
              p. 28), after comparing many parallel passages in Warner and <i>Err.</i>—most are too faint to be useful—and after comparing the treatment of
              the characters common to both plays, concludes that Sh.’s play is the altogether
              richer version, even if Sh. knew Warner; he does not consider the Latin play. <a href="#s_ard1a" class="ref witness">Cuningham</a> (ed.
              1907, pp. xxv ff.) gathers 14 passages from Warner which may be considered with
                much reason to have been in Shakespeare’s mind when engaged on the composition of
                his <i>Errors</i>.
              <a href="#pw_balt1928" class="ref bibl_pw">Baldwin</a>
              (ed. 1928, p. xvii n.): A curious illustration of Warner’s stage eye is the <i>spinter</i> of Plautus, which Cooper defines as
                  A . . . bracelet. But a bracelet is not spectacular enough for the
                stage duty to which Shakespeare wishes to put this piece of jewelry, so he changes
                it to a chain, seemingly of aldermanic proportions, to be worn with flaunting
                visibility around the neck. And a chain it becomes in Warner, for no apparent reason
                unless it be whim, or an echo of Shakespeare.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_tans1932" class="ref bibl">Tannenbaum</a>
              (1932, pp. 103–5) adds phrases from Warner that have counterparts in <i>Err.</i>: pulses beate so sore ( above; TLN <a href="#tln_1336" class="ref lb">1336</a>);
                his eies sparkle: they rowle in his head; his colour goes and comes: he
                lookes wildly (; TLN <a href="#tln_1381" class="ref lb">1381</a>); and threatens to pull out mine
                eyes (; TLN <a href="#tln_1392" class="ref lb">1392</a>).</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed.
              1962, pp. xxv f.): It is possible that Shakespeare had seen [Warner]. . . . It
                is written in lively prose, and reveals some parallels with <i>The
                  Comedy of Errors</i>, for example, in echoes of words like patch [<a href="#tln_0654" class="ref lb">654</a>], stale [<a href="#tln_0377" class="ref lb">377</a>], and harlots [<a href="#tln_1682" class="ref lb">1682</a>]; in an emphasis on madness; in the suggestion that [<i>xxvi</i>] Erotium is a witch (this is not in the Latin); and in the phrase
                  birds that bear feathers, or fishes that have fins (Latin avis squamosas, piscis pennatos, l. 918; i.e. birds with
                scales, fish with feathers), which could have suggested the line, [<a href="#tln_0743" class="ref lb">743</a>]. He notices the substitution
              of the chain for Plautus’s bracelet (see n. <a href="#cn_0382" class="ref note_cn">382</a>). However, even those who have made as much as possible of the
                verbal similarities have not been able to build up a convincing case that
                Shakespeare knew Warner’s translation; indeed, the reverse could be true, that
                Warner echoed Shakespeare.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">No recent commentator believes that Sh. used Warner rather than Plautus.</p>

              acknowledgment of <i>Amphitruo</i> above is noticed apparently only
              by <a href="#pw_balt1928" class="ref bibl_pw">Baldwin</a>
              (ed. 1928, p. xx n.). <a href="#b_balt1965b" class="ref bibl">Idem</a> (<i>Genetics</i>, 1965, p. 210): The
                earliest reference works had connected <i>Amphitruo</i> with
                  <i>Menaechmi</i> as sources of <i>Errors</i>.
                But the connection dropped out of the eighteenth-century tradition and was
                halfheartedly reinstated only in the second half of the nineteenth. The early
                reference works, however, had not specified the details of the relationship. The
                first to specify both the doubled twins and the shut-out husband was Moritz Rapp [in
                  <i>Shakspere</i>, ed. Keller &amp; Rapp, 1843,
              7:3–4].</p>

              (p. 91) to two lines from the Supposita, Tun’, furcifur, meis procul prohibessis aedibus? | Tun’ meas pulsare foreis? hasce
                illico toto demoliar cardine (What, rascal, would you be for driving me away from my own house? What, <i>would you hinder me</i> from knocking at my own door. I’ll this
                instant tear it from off all its hinges; ). He likens them to <i>Err.</i>

                statement would be that the two plots have been combined to the marked modification

              one wished to deny the influence of <i>Amphitruo</i>; it had not yet
              been translated into English and hence presumably could not be read by a Sh. who
              supposedly could not read Latin. <a href="#b_couw1903" class="ref bibl">Courthope</a> (1903, p. 79) thinks he is the first to name

                Alcmena, pious [<i>30</i>] <i>matrona</i>, who
                elevates Adriana beyond the merely dull or shrewish stereotype. The rhetoric of
                accusation and protest between husband and wife in <i>Amphitruo</i> inspires several confrontations in <i>Errors</i>. He cites Gill (1930), who lists all the parallels between
                <i>Err.</i> and <i>Amphitruo</i> (numbers are to

              (1966, pp. 7–9): In the <i>Captivi</i> the father’s name is
                Hegio, which Shakespeare could easily have turned to Egeon, although . . . the
                exact form of the name may have come from the legends of Theseus and his father
                Aegeus, King of Athens. He tells the <i>Captivi</i> story
              of a father losing two sons, one stolen, the other taken prisoner in war. After a
              long-delayed reconciliation comes a passage in which Hegio displays a (p. 8) clash of emotions . . . when it is revealed that one of the prisoners is
                his own long-lost son. The passage . . . is one that would have appealed strongly

              Another feature of the <i>Captivi</i> which would

              that Sh. did more than merely multiply the incidents of the <i>Menaechmi</i>: He let us know that some power was at work in
                these misadventures and in their very multiplicity, or at least that there were
                grounds for supposing so; and the audience, so differently from that attending to
                Plautus, is being brought to think of all this as somehow the demonstration of
                mysterious influences making use of the confusion, turning it all to
                good. . . . </p>

                sense of the tenderness as well as the strength of human love, and I think he gave
                Shakespeare the lead he wanted on this very matter although he himself could not
                have conceived of the happiness Shakespeare took into view. The hint for bringing
                this unearthly loveliness into this high-spirited comedy came from another of
                Plautus’s, the <i>Rudens</i>. Here there is a scene like that with
                which <i>The Tempest</i> was to begin, where two men from the
                shore are watching a storm tear a ship to pieces. They see survivors, two women,

              devotes his book to demonstrating (p. 3) that Shakespeare . . . made a close
                study of the classical tradition at the beginning of his career, especially
              an exhaustive study of all Plautus’s plays. He strongly denies <a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a>’s emphasis on Terence as
              an influence, and in this respect Riehle needs studying to help students balance the
              massive scholarship and emphatic certainty of Baldwin. But in his way Riehle is as
              certain as Baldwin that he can trace to Plautus the sources for major and minor
              aspects of <i>Err.</i> He credits Sh. with a level of classical
              attainments that is not credible, as for example when he derives Erotes and Errotis
              from the Greek (p. 178) <i>ἐρωτάω</i>
                to ask,
                to try to find out. The proper form of the name would then be
                  Erotetes, but the contraction may be explained as a case of
                haplology. . . . This cognomen has to be seen in the light of other Shakespearean
                names of Greek [<i>179</i>] origin, such as, for example, Ophelia
                and Sycorax. In any case, it is an astonishing instance of Shakespeare’s
                erudition. (<a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> [1947, p. 697] makes the same claim for to
                ask, only to abandon it.) Excesses such as this and others, equally
              implausible, about the names are compensated for by careful, detailed readings of
              Plautus and <i>Err.</i> where it is often likely that Sh. responded
              to patterns of theme and structure that a sensitive playwright might absorb.</p>

                reformulates and interrogates his New Comedic heritage. . . . Throughout his works
                Shakespeare creatively adapts New Comedic dramaturgy. . . . Dramatic devices like
                the lock-out, disguise, and eavesdropping appear in strange translations as do
                familiar New Comedic configurations: the blocking father, his daughter, her lover;
                the clever slave and master; the importunate lover and worldly courtesan; the
                reunion of parent and child. As always, classical elements, present in different
                degrees in different plays, combine with non-classical ones—the Bible, medieval
                literature, the Italian novella, contemporary fiction and drama—not in static

              elements of Plautus and Terence generally, using them in whatever new combinations he
              needs; Sh. has been saturated with New Comedy, not just two plays. (P. 22):
                Although no one would deny Shakespeare’s general indebtedness to Plautus in
                this play, the specific tally of debits and credits has occasioned some dispute.
                Because the two Dromios . . . sport Italian names . . . some have thought them
                Italianate rather than Plautine. But not every classical slave is <i>callidus</i>; many, including Messenio of <i>Menæchmi</i> and
                Sosia of <i>Amphitruo</i>, are humorous victims of abuse and
                misunderstanding. Moreover, the two Dromios continually replay jokes and routines
                from New Comedy, such as complaining about obeying orders, yearning for
              freedom, running breathless onstage, using the rope as a stage prop after the
              convention of calling people mastigia (one who deserves a whipping),
              and so on, elements taken from other plays than <i>Menaechmi</i>.

              influenced the romantic tone of <i>Err.</i> and not just the
              farcical spine of the action. His chapter is as much about Plautus as Sh., but as with
                <a href="#b_gile1930" class="ref bibl">Gill</a> (1930)
              above, he emphasizes the Latin Plautus, since he says that Sh. could have had no
              recourse to all the plays in translation. (P. 22): In the <i>Menaechmi</i>, in the jockeying with dreams and madness, there is nothing of
                the poignancy of the thought of real madness that hovers over the confusions of
                  <i>Amphitryon</i> and especially over the servant Sosia in that
                play . . . ; nor . . . is there anything like the sense of pain we share with
                Hegio in <i>The Captives</i>, who believes a servant has destroyed
                his last hope of retrieving a son. Nor as in <i>The Shipwreck</i>
                is there the pathos and loneliness of a youth whose betrothed has been stolen from
                him, although Menaechmus of Syracuse is in bad straits. The hints of such feelings
                in the <i>Menaechmi</i> may have been enough for Shakespeare for
                the emphasis he required in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, or the
                  <i>Amphitryon</i> may have given him the lead, but, however that
                may be, for Plautus as for Shakespeare comedy such as theirs would always entertain
                sharp distress and pathos in the midst of the fun. He reneges a bit about
              the <i>Rudens</i> (see above) (p. 38): I do not know that
                Shakespeare read [<i>Rudens</i>], but something of this same
                romantic character belongs to Plautus almost everywhere, although there is only a
                hint of it in the <i>Menaechmi</i>, notably in the brief comment
                on the father in the Prologue—[quotes <a href="#tln_0160" class="ref lb">160–1</a>]—whether this was the hint that Shakespeare
                took, or whether it was the beauty of the wonderful in the <i>Amphitryon</i>, or still something else, it is precisely the incident about
                the father’s arrival in Ephesus that provided Shakespeare with the play’s initiating
                circumstance and that gives it its initially romantic cast. . . . </p>

                extract a good lesson from either of the two Plautine plays, but Shakespeare has no

                action are set forth, and in which the one pathetic touch is the father’s death
                because of the loss of his child, has been developed in the story of Ægeon into a
                serious and wonderfully pathetic background.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_rouw1912" class="ref bibl">Rouse</a> (1912, pp. xiii f.) counts up the mistaken meetings in Plautus
              and <i>Err.</i>: Menæchmus the Citizen does not meet any
                strangers until the last scene, when he is confronted with his double. Menæchmus the
                Traveller has seven such meetings (counting each of the important characters as
                one); the Wife, the Father, and Messenio have two each; Peniculus, Erotium,
                Cylindrus, and the maid one each. On the other hand: in Shakespeare Antipholus the
                Citizen has [<i>xiv</i>] three such meetings, Antipholus the
                Traveller twelve; Dromio the Citizen’s man has four, and the other Dromio eleven
                (counting the house scene as one [of the eleven]); Adriana . . . has seven; her
                sister . . . eight; the Courtezan four; and Luce one. The proportion of Shakespeare
                to Plautus is 50:17, or nearly three to one. This was made possible by the invention
                of the second Dromio.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_gile1924" class="ref bibl">Gill</a> (1924,
              pp. 80 ff.) compares the characters in <i>Menaechmi</i> and <i>Err.</i>, though her discussion usually does little more than describe
              incidents common to the two plays. After three tables, Characters Common to
                Both Plays,
              Shakespeare’s Additions, and In the  “Menaechmi,”  Omitted by Shakespeare, she covers each person
              named.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 80): There are sixteen characters (besides the gaoler, officer, etc.) in
                Shakespeare’s play in contrast to the ten in the play of Plautus. Of the Shakespeare
                additions, Dromio of Ephesus is chief in importance, and Luciana is next. Then comes
                the enveloping-action group, the Duke, Aegeon, and Aemilia, while as minor
                characters the merchants aid the complicating situations, and Luce adds somewhat to
                the fun.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She thinks that Luciana partly fulfills the function of the father in the <i>Menaechmi</i> in that (p. 92) the old man champions the
                husband’s liberty, chides the wife for her jealous nagging, but is fair enough to
                see that the husband also is to blame in 5.2.785–805.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Summarizing, she says (p. 93): 1. Shakespeare has added to his
                characters traits which are lacking in those of Plautus, and thus he makes them more
                complex and more human; as, for example, to Antipholus of Syracuse he has given
                morality, honesty, and sentiment, and in Adriana he has added to the jealousy and
                temper of the wife womanly qualities of which there is no suggestion in
                [Plautus].</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              2. He has used one character as a foil for another: he contrasts
                Adriana and Luciana, Antipholus of Ephesus and Antipholus of Syracuse, and to a less
                degree, the two Dromios.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              3. He has seized upon some of the most human traits in the characters
                of Plautus—sometimes little more than suggested—and intensified them, such as the
                serious-mindedness and the melancholy of the twin who seeks his brother; the charm
                and ability of the married brother, as evidenced by his popularity and his business
                reputation; and the affection of slave for master.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>94</i>] 4. He has transferred actions from one
                character to another for the sake of consistency in character or for dramatic
                effect; for example, he transfers to the rash married brother the violence of the
                more serious brother in the Latin play when he is accused of madness. The most
                notable instance of this transference is that of the reprimand and philosophy of the
                father to the two women, the young Luciana and the older, more experienced
                mother. All these similarities and differences, it may be remarked, Sh.
              could have made if he had Warner’s 1595 translation to work with, a point <a href="#b_gile1924" class="ref bibl">Gill</a> does not

              (1931: 1938, pp. 47, 64–5): Sh. turned to Plautus to get away from the romantic
              formlessness of <i>LLL</i>: He submitted himself to a
                discipline which, however uncongenial to the spirit, was a salutary apprenticeship
                to the mechanics of play-building. He constructs a typical Roman play,
              features of which Sh. adapted.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 64): Yet . . . transplanting stories to other societies in other and
                later periods of time is bound to sever them from that which gives them their
                essential significance. . . . In particular there are these all-important
                men-servants. The English bourgeoisie of the sixteenth century had no exact
                counterpart of them in their households. Hence the Dromios are exotic on the English
                stage. In England, menial servants who are soundly kicked at frequent intervals are
                hardly likely to be taken into the confidential personal secrets of the
                  masters. . . . [<i>65</i>] In their new surroundings on an
                English stage, circumstance scarcely ever allows them to be the engineers of the
                story as Roman slaves are. Almost invariably, they are merely its
                clowns.
              <a href="#b_chah1931" class="ref bibl">Charlton</a> turns
              his essay into character studies of the principals and lists the changes that Sh.
              made: inventing the jailor-constable and Pinch, omitting the parasite, making Adriana
              more appealing than Plautus’s shrewish wife.</p>

                This variety, which has sometimes been taken as evidence that [<i>Err.</i>] is an old play worked over, rather indicates Shakespeare’s
                wish to imitate the variety that he found in Plautus. The form used by him always
                fits the mood, the speaker, and the situation.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_crah1948" class="ref bibl">Craig</a> (1948,
              pp. 22, 26): The genius of Plautus manifests itself splendidly in the fifth
                act, which is masterly. It contains a long and extremely amusing scene between
                Menaechmus the Traveler and his brother’s wife, Mulier [woman; her
                proper name is never disclosed], which is heightened by an interview with Senex [old
                man], her father, and further heightened by a side-splitting examination of the
                angry Citizen by Medicus [doctor] in order to determine his sanity. It is much
                better than the encounter with Dr. Pinch . . . for Shakespeare’s play misses the
                humor of the situation. It is the Traveler who in Plautus was suspected of insanity,
                who actually counterfeited insanity, and it is the Citizen who undergoes the
                examination.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 26): <i>Err.</i>
              is clear and easy to follow just as drama, without the aid of long explanatory
                speeches such as Plautus usually employs in order to make his action
              clear.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed.
              1962, pp. xxv f.): Shakespeare not only multiplied the twins and the
                possibilities of error . . . by creating the Dromios, he also altered the emphasis
                of the Plautine plot. In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> the Courtesan
                loses prominence and has no name, while the wife not only gains in stature and
                acquires a name, Adriana, but has, too, a confidante in her sister Luciana. The
                parasite and the wife’s father vanish altogether, while the courtesan’s maid and
                cook are transferred to the wife, and changed into Luce, Adriana’s servant, and
                Nell, the unseen kitchen-wench. . . . In <i>Menaechmi</i>, thanks to the long interchange in Act I between Menaechmus of
                Epidamnum (who corresponds to Antipholus of Ephesus) and the parasite (who was cut
                out altogether by Shakespeare), and the sequence between him and his father-in-law
                at the end, of which only fragments are retained in <i>The Comedy of
                  Errors</i>, this Menaechmus is the centre of dramatic interest. Considerably
                more prominence was given by Shakespeare to the other twin, and Antipholus of
                Syracuse has nearly a hundred lines more than his brother, as well as a more
                sympathetic rôle, which includes the wooing of Luciana. In addition, the characters
                of Shakespeare’s play are given more humanity, and more distinctiveness, as even the
                rather flat Medicus of Plautus is transformed into the egregious Doctor
                Pinch. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>xxvi</i>] The most direct link between <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> and <i>Menaechmi</i> is
                the use of the terms Surreptus (Sereptus) and Errotis (Erotes) to describe
                respectively Antipholus of Ephesus and his twin of Syracuse.</p>

              pp. 494–7): Even in farce, something must be going on already—Antipholus of
                Ephesus late for dinner again, his wife in her usual rage. . . . He [Sh.] also
                creates a prosperous commercial town outside the domestic world of the jealous
                wife’s household: its merchant-citizens are going about their individual business,
                well known to one another and comfortably combining business with pleasure—until the
                errors catch up with them. Much the same can be said of <i>Menaechmi</i> save that Sh. has more characters.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Then, talking about the treatment of the wives, <a href="#b_barc1964" class="ref bibl">Barber</a> says Plautus is
              unambiguous as to whether she has been and is being misused (p. 495): The difference reflects the difference in the two cultures, Roman and Elizabethan.
                It also reflects the different form of comedy which Shakespeare was beginning to
                work out, a comedy appropriate to the fullest potentialities of his culture. Roman
                comedy functioned as a special field-day for outrageousness; by and large, it fitted
                Aristotle’s formula that comedy deals with characters who are worse than we
                are. . . . Most of the stage people are meant to be fractions of human nature on
                its aggressive, libidinal side. . . . [Sh.’s] characters . . . are presented as
                total, not fractional: whatever their faults, they are conceived as whole people.
                His comedy dramatizes outrageousness, but usually it is presented as the product of
                special circumstances, or at least it is [<i>496</i>] abetted by
                circumstances. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>497</i>] Shakespeare’s sense of comedy as a
                moment in a larger cycle leads him to go out of the way . . . to frame farce with
                action which presents the weight of age and the threat of death, and to make the
                comic resolution a renewal of life.</p>

            
            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_hama1967" class="ref bibl">Hamilton</a>
              (1967, pp. 91–5, 101–3): An emphasis upon plot may seem inevitable in
                a play that derives from both Plautus’ boisterous intrigue and Terence’s complicated
                action, especially for an Elizabethan dramatist with his love of variety in action.
                Yet the decision to imitate the <i>Menaechmi</i> involves
                Shakespeare in a problem of structure. Plautus’ plot is episodic, or, in Aristotle’s
                terms, simple rather than complex (<i>Poetics</i> 1452<sup>a</sup>12), and superficial in the sense of lying upon the
                narrative level in the repetition of episodes involving mistaken identity. An error
                results from a previous error, and each follows the other mechanically until, after
                all possibilities have been exhausted, the brothers are brought together upon the
                  stage. . . . [<i>92</i>] Lacking any logic of its own, the play
                substitutes for a plot the mathematical possibilities of error inherent in the comic
                situation of a twin’s being mistaken for his identical brother. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              In avoiding this danger, his play illustrates Aristotle’s rules that
                the change of fortune that resolves the action—here the meeting of the two
                brothers—should involve recognition combined with peripety, and that both should
                result from the construction of the plot (<i>Poetics</i> 1452<sup>a</sup>14–20). Consequently, the plot expresses his idea of
                comedy and becomes the soul of a play he ambitiously terms THE <i>Comedy of Errors</i>.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              Shakespeare shapes his entire comedy most obviously through the device
                of Egeon’s tragic story, which serves as both the point of departure and the
                resolution of the comedy of errors. . . . [<i>93</i>] Egeon’s story
                becomes the prologue or argument to the comedy of errors in the sense that the
                comedy will reverse his tragic fall. . . . 
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              Plautus is significant in showing Shakespeare what to avoid. In place
                of a mechanical repetition of mistaken identity . . . Shakespeare seeks dramatic
                complexity. A comparison of the episodes where the wife meets her husband
                illustrates this point. In Plautus, the comic situation presents a simple domestic
                quarrel: through Peniculus’ spite, an angry [<i>94</i>] wife accuses
                an embarrassed and blustering husband of stealing her cloak. She rages, he lies, and
                the Parasite enjoys his revenge. . . . When Shakespeare imitates this episode, he
                offers, in place of a comedy of situation, a complex drama of human confusion in
                which the wife sees her husband and servant conspiring against her, the husband sees
                his wife and servant conspiring against him, and the servant remains confounded
                between them. Each speaks the truth, yet appears to lie, and the episode ends in
                bafflement, rage, and growing madness. . . .

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>95</i>] To have error culminate in madness is one
                means by which Shakespeare imposes form upon the comic device of mistaken identity.
                Taking the hint from Plautus, where both brothers are accused of being mad, he
                applies it directly to Antipholus of Ephesus.
              <a href="#b_hama1967" class="ref bibl">Hamilton</a>

              Shakespeare constructs his play in order to achieve as great a
                reversal of intention as possible. Aristotle illustrates peripety from a play about

              (1974, pp. 1–3): Plautus is more rational than Sh. in accounting for, e.g., how the
              cook knows the visiting Menaechmus’s name (see above, ), namely that courtesans send spies to learn the names of
              passengers on in-coming ships and feign acquaintanceship of them, whereas Sh. (p.3)
                takes fewer pains . . . to give a logical underpropping to his comic
                fantasy. There is nothing improbable in identical twins, but identical twins with
                the same name takes some explaining, and Plautus is ready with the answer:
                  When it was tolde us that you and our father were both dead, our Graundsire

                Shakespeare provides <i>two</i> sets of twins with the same name,
                and not a word of explanation.</p>

              investigates (p. 20) the logical distinction between errors of cognition and
                errors of association. In all comedies which revolve around Doppelgänger,
                individuals either may be mistaken about the identity of a character or may
                incorrectly attribute actions to a character whom they correctly
              identify.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He goes through <i>Menaechmi</i> and <i>Err.</i>

                Shakespeare to Plautus is 50:17 or nearly three to one (p. 22): This
                is true theoretically, but in one sense irrelevant. Though we might expect
                Shakespeare to increase the number of misidentifications, in fact, he uses the new
                set of twins in order to radiate confusions of attribution. Arithmetically, one
                might observe that Shakespeare is less efficient than Plautus . . . [who] almost
                doubles the possibilities of confusion inherent in his material, whereas Shakespeare
                adds only two more scenes to the number which the original possibilities
                suggest.</p>

                shortness and because of the alien morals and manners of the Plautine world. It is
                notable, for example, that the courtesan has a more important role in the <i>Menaechmi</i> than in [<i>Err.</i>]. In spite of
                Renaissance assumptions about the moral function of comedy . . . there is not the
                faintest sign that Plautus disapproved of his hero’s conduct.</p>

                  <i>Err.</i>] that we can base our assessment of the freedom with
                which Shakespeare adapted and added and also come to recognize when he broke with
                direct or indirect Plautine influence to adopt other dramatic methods and style,
                particularly those of Terence, whose plays contain fully developed double
              plots. I would like to suggest that Shakespeare, whose knowledge of Plautus and
                Terence was as great as theirs had been of Menander and Apollodorus, took the same
                liberties with Plautine narrative and with Terence’s interlocking double plots as
                Terence had done with his Greek forebears and that this freedom opened the way for
                an even greater expansion of that comic complication and character
                illumination of which [Richard] Levin speaks [<i>The Multiple Plot in
                  English Renaissance Drama</i>]. The result is that in Shakespeare’s play there
                are not two, but <i>three</i> levels of dramatic sensibility, each
                projecting a different tone.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She says that in drawing the two Dromios from <i>Amphitruo</i>, Sh.
              practiced Terentian <i>contaminatio</i>, and
              in addition, he practiced (p. 20) extracontamination, adding characters
              and situations from nondramatic sources (Egeon and the Abbess) and (p. 21)
                  auto-contamination, the addition of a character of his own

              67–8): Like <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, <i>The

                generation, and because of this its [<i>68</i>] relationship to the
                rest of Shakespeare’s comedies is rather like that of <i>Titus
                  Andronicus</i> to the tragedies. Because it is so faithfully Plautine
                it is clearly distinguished from the majority of Shakespeare’s comedies, if
                not their antithesis as a type of drama.

              (1964, p. 149): Sh. humanizes Plautus by turning one clever Messenio into two English,
              in fact London, servingmen, while Emilia’s lecture in 5.1 on getting along as man and
              wife is not too severe. <a href="#b_guna1965" class="ref bibl">Günther</a> (1965, pp. 37–8) summarizes what Sh. took from the Plautus
              plays and what he added. <a href="#b_tile1965" class="ref bibl">Tillyard</a> (1965, p. 49): Shakespeare did something which we
                need not connect with any precedent. He humanized his farcical nucleus and
                approximated it to comedy in a way Plautus never even began to do. First, he made
                his Ephesus a more living city than Plautus’s Epidamnus. Ephesus became a place
                where not only ridiculous things happened but where men encountered the perennial
                problem of how to live together in a society. Second, he defined and contrasted his
                persons in a way Plautus never tried to do.
              <a href="#b_soer1972" class="ref bibl">Soellner</a>
              (1972, p. 68): It is interesting to note that this passionate outbreak [<a href="#tln_1327" class="ref lb">1327–97</a>] of the
                Ephesian Menaechmus [sic: Antipholus] was Shakespeare’s revision. In Plautus, it is
                the stranger-Menaechmus who is characterized as a man of ungovernable
                temper . . . whereas the citizen-Menaechmus is and remains fairly even-tempered.

                Of all the many adaptations of the <i>Menaechmi</i>, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is by far the freest and most
                original. . . . It is the best plotted of Shakespeare’s early comedies, due, no
                doubt, to the fact that he had the play of Plautus as a model and preserved the
                Plautine unities.
              <a href="#b_higg1949" class="ref bibl">Highet</a> (1949,
              p. 214): Shakespeare did not merely lift the idea [of twin servants] from
                  <i>Amphitryon</i> and insert it <i>en bloc</i> into the other play, but blended the two plays in
                an organic fusion to make a new and richer drama.
              <a href="#b_ducg1952" class="ref bibl">Duckworth</a>
              (1952, p. 418) repeats Highet without attribution, adding <i>The
                  Comedy of Errors</i> is not a combination of scenes from two Plautine comedies
                but a completely new play, in which the classical material and the newer, more
                pathetic, elements have been blended to create an organic whole—an excellent fusion
                of romantic spirit and classical restraint in which pathos and farce exist side by

              (1924, pp. 303–4) flatly prefers Plautus to Sh., calling the preference for Sh.
                blunders which depend on ignorance of Plautus and an apparent
                belief that Shakspere is omnipotent. Sh.’s defect is the doubling of the
              twins. It is well enough to insist that the more improbabilities the funnier
                the farce, but is the fun heightened by confusion of the audience? Why make a farce
                an extravaganza? Furthermore, Sh. adds six characters to Plautus’s ten, so
              that (p. 304) his minor characters have not enough to do to make them either
                indispensable or adequately amusing. Through the mouth of another character Luce is
                mildly funny as an amorous greasy Joan; through the mouth of another character Pinch
                is as graphic as the apothecary in Romeo and Juliet, and so on through the
              whole cast, all diluted in Sh., pungent and forceful in Plautus. Sh. was immature and
              improved immeasurably. Though Connely exaggerates, one might as well admit the justice
              of many of his points.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_wath1925" class="ref bibl">Watt</a> (1925,

              pointless, for the two plays were written under conditions entirely different
                and served audiences as remote as the poles. Connely does not sufficiently
              respond to the (p. 402) romantic spirit of Elizabethan comedy and the dramatic
                form which that spirit assumed. No comparison of the Latin and the Elizabethan play
                can be sound which is based on the assumption that Shakespeare tried on the whole to
                copy Plautus, and that he is weakest where he is least skillful as an
                imitator.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_ducg1952" class="ref bibl">Duckworth</a>
              (1952, p. 418) admires <i>Err.</i>, but the presence of two
                sets of twins . . . makes the play more confusing [than <i>Menaechmi</i>] and heightens the improbability of the situation, as was not
                the case in the <i>Amphitruo</i>, where the two pairs of doublets
                were created by divine <i>fiat</i>. The
                entrances and exits of Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse at times lack motivation
                and the conclusion of the comedy is complicated by an excessive number of
                recognitions. Plautus’ comedy has a unity and a compactness lacking in Shakespeare’s
                play; it is pure farce, while <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> has far
                greater variety and is thoroughly Elizabethan in its combination of farce, romance,
                and pathos.</p>

              Plautus; he quotes recent criticism (e.g., <a href="#s_pel1" class="ref witness">Jorgensen</a>, ed. 1964; <a href="#b_bara1974" class="ref bibl">Barton</a>, in <a href="#s_evns" class="ref witness">Evans</a>, ed. 1974;

              ed. 1988), remarking first that everyone takes <i>Err.</i> to be the
              first comedy, if not the first play, without sufficient evidence: Recent
                scholarship would place <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> somewhere
                toward the end of the first quarter of Shakespeare’s career—not, by a long shot, his
                earliest play or even his earliest comedy. But most of the critics I am about to
                quote consider it his first work, and yet they feel no compunction about repeatedly
                asserting that, in every sort of way, it surpasses a mature work of one of the two
                acknowledged masters of Roman comedy.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Second, he objects to the notion that Sh. improves on Plautus by cleaning up the
              immorality. (P. 397): It is no doubt symptomatic of my own cynicism,
                amorality, and satirical hardness that this description [<a href="#s_ban2" class="ref witness">Bevington</a>’s] of the superiority of
                Shakespeare’s play makes me want to read Plautus. I am reminded of Joe Orton’s wish
                that he should never write anything as bad as Shakespeare’s first
                plays. Are we to deduce from Bevington that courtesans are less legitimate as the
                subjects of great art than virtuous sisters? Must every comedy
                  enhance the love interest? The phrase [<i>398</i>]
                could have been excerpted from a movie magnate’s memo to a hack scriptwriter. Is it
                the business of a great artist to reshape his material in order to
                  reconcile it with the moral values of his time and
                place? . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>400</i>] What I personally admire about

                exuberant and fantastic amorality. And what I dislike about Shakespeare’s
                comedies—and tragedies—is their softness, their central mushiness, their inevitable
                  love interest, their wholesomeness.</p>

                because he does nothing more than evoke a rather simple laughter.
                Presumably, therefore, great comedy does something more than make us

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">4 Then said Paul, Iohn verely baptized with the baptisme of repentance, saying

                  is, in Christ Iesus.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">5 So when they heard it, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus.</p>

                  disciples, and disputed daily in the schole of one Tyrannus.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">10 And this was done by the space of two yeres, so that all

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">15 And the euil spirit answered, and said, Iesus I acknowledge, and Paul I knowe:

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">16 And the man in whome y<sup>e</sup> euil spirit was, ran on

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">17 And this was knowen to all the Iewes &amp; Grecians also, which dwelt at
                  Ephesus, &amp; feare came on them all, and the Name of the Lord Iesus was
                  magnified.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">18 And many that beleued, came and cõfessed, and shewed their workes.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">19 Many also of them, which vsed curious artes, broght their

                  founde it fiftie thousand <i>pieces</i> of siluer.</p>
                
                

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">20 So the worde of God grewe mightely, and preuailed.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">21 ¶ Now when these things were accomplished, Paul purposed by the Spirit to
                  passe through Macedonia and Achaia, and to go to Ierusalem, saying, After I haue

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">22 So sent he into Macedonia two of them that ministred vnto him, Timotheus and

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">23 And the same time there arose no smale trouble about that way.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">24 For a certeine man named Demetrius a siluersmith, which made siluer temples of

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">26 Moreouer ye se and heare, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost through out
                  all Asia this Paul hathe persuaded, &amp; turned away muche people, saying, That

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">27 So that not onely this thing is dangerous vnto vs, that the state shulde be
                  reproued, but also that the temple of the great goddesse Diana shulde be nothing
                  estemed, and that it wolde come to passe that her magnificence, which all Asia and
                  the worlde worshippeth, shulde be destroyed.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">28 Now when they heard it, they were ful of wrath, and cryed out, saying, Great
                    <i>is</i> Diana of the Ephesians.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">29 And the whole citie was ful of cõfusion, and they rushed into the commune
                  place with one assent, and caught Gaius, and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, &amp;
                  Pauls companions of his iourney.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">30 And whẽ Paul wolde haue entred in vnto the people, the disciples suffred him

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">31 Certeine also of the chief of Asia which were his friẽds, sent vnto him,

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">32 Some therefore cryed one thing, and some another: for the assemblie was out of

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">33 And <i>some</i> of the companie drewe forthe Alexander, the

                  haue excused the matter to the people.</p>

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">34 But when they knewe that he was a Iewe, there arose a shoute almoste for the

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">35 Then the towne clarke when he had stayed the people, said, Ye mẽ of Ephesus,
                  what man is it that knoweth not how that the citie of the Ephesians is a

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">36 Seing then that no man can speake against these things, ye oght to be

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">37 For ye haue broght hither these men, which haue neither commit sacrilege,

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">38 Wherefore, if Demetrius and the craftes men which are with him, haue a matter

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">39 But if ye inquire anie thing concerning other matters it maye be determined in

                <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">41 And when he had thus spoken, he let the assemblie departe.</p>

          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Shakespeare’s Use of the Bible</h4>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_uptj1746" class="ref bibl">Upton</a> (1748,
            pp. 323–4 n.), commenting on <a href="#tln_0263" class="ref lb">263–8</a>, first notes Acts 19 as a reason Sh. chose to
            set the play in Ephesus. See n. <a href="#cn_0002a" class="ref note_cn">2</a>.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_bulg1957" class="ref bibl">Bullough</a> (1957,
            1:9–10) first elaborates the influence of Ephesians beyond the mere reputation of
            Ephesus as a city Paul visits in Acts 19: But
              why substitute Ephesus [for Epidamnus]?</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            His choice was, I believe, connected with his interest in family
              relationships, and also with his desire to make <i>The Comedy</i> a
              play of wonders in which every loose end should finally be tied up. Ephesus was well
              known to Elizabethans as the capital of Roman Asia, a great seaport, renowned for its
              Temple of Diana and as the place where St Paul stayed two years (Acts xix). The <i>Epistle to the Ephesians</i> includes
              earnest exhortations to domestic unity. [He quotes 5:22–33.] [<i>10</i>] The Apostle also writes of relations
              between children and parents, and urges servants to be obedient unto them that
                are your masters, while masters are to forbear threatening their servants
                (VI.1–9). Is it fanciful to suggest that
              Shakespeare saw the aptness of this as he christianized somewhat the ethics of
              Plautus’s comedy? Does the Ephesian locale explain why the Mother becomes an Abbess,
              in reminiscence of the Temple of Diana with its priestesses?
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In addition, Ephesus was a place of sorcerers and exorcists, and
                curious arts as St Paul states. Of this idea Shakespeare makes good
              use. See n. <a href="#cn_0002a" class="ref note_cn">2</a>.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed.
            1962, p. xxix) acknowledges <a href="#b_bulg1957" class="ref bibl">Bullough</a>’s citations, and adds Eph. 4:22–4,
            and 6:11–17 in his Appendix 1, pp. 113–15, collating
            Geneva and Bishops’.</p>

            and breaking down the wall of partition. [It is perhaps useless to object that what
            separates the twins in Act 3 is a door, not a wall, a fact that might hinder an
            audience’s getting an allusion to Eph.] She cites Eph. 2:14–15
              (Authorized Version): For he [Christ] is our peace, who hath made both
              one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us [Jew and
              Gentile] . . . for to make in himself of twain one new man. She explains:
                Breaking down the wall of partition . . . joins the rending
              of the veil of the temple as a radical crossing or abolition of boundaries; and both
              link the Crucifixion to the anagogy it figures, the final apocalyptic [<i>39</i>] removal of partition walls.</p>

              Metaphor,”  1983, adding how the rhetorical figure <i>geminatio</i>, the doublet, pervades the language, structure, and
            plot of the play, dramatizing the biblical narrative of the twins Jacob and Esau.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_kina1988" class="ref bibl">Kinney</a> (1988,
            pp. 36–8, 48, 50): Here [Eph.] we find in the Christian New Testament,
              rather than in Roman farce, the source that inspired <i>all</i> parts
              of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>—that gives it its overall shape and
              significance, not only mixing with but embodying and transforming Plautine
              conventions. This summary comes not in the sermon on order and on the directions for
              husbands and wives, parents and children that has often been cited from Ephesians 6, . . . but in the summary of life’s
              experiences in Ephesians 2 (a text as popular with
              the Tudors as the later passage). This is a source which has never been cited in
              connection with <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, but which proceeds from
              a statement on death not unlike Egeon’s through the sin and confusion of the play’s
              chief action and finally to the last transformation of spirit before the priory.
                And you <i>hathe he quickened</i>, Paul writes [Eph. 2:2–10]. [<i>37</i>] <i>This</i> is the Ephesus the Elizabethans knew by trained instinct, not
              Shakespeare’s. The enforced segregation of Syracusan and Ephesian in the play—like the
              separation of Jews from Gentiles and Christians from Pharisees in the Bible—results
              from human sin and hostility which focus on the wrong kind of transgression of the
              wrong kind of laws. The Elizabethans knew and understood that from childhood. Such
              divisive acts of fallen man, spurred on by evil lust and Satanic intention in
              Shakespeare’s play, were just those acts that God, Jesus, and Paul meant to heal by
                <i>reunion</i>. Thus the central theme of the letter to the
              Ephesians, and one which Elizabethan preachers proclaimed with cogency and simplicity,
              is not only that of order but that of a reuniting—we think of the speeches on reunion
              as a kind of transformation back into the original state in <i>The
                Comedy of Errors</i> [fn. to <a href="#tln_0199" class="ref lb">199</a>
              ff., <a href="#tln_0590" class="ref lb">590–1</a>, <a href="#tln_1125" class="ref lb">1125–8</a>, <a href="#tln_1133" class="ref lb">1133–4</a>, <a href="#tln_1747" class="ref lb">1747–9</a>]—and the same
              theme emphasized in the only drama written with Paul as its hero, the non-cycle Digby
              play known as <i>The Conversion of St. Paul</i>. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Sensing this deeper organization in a play more integral and traditional
              than it is to us, the Tudors would see the end of <i>The Comedy of [<i>38</i>] Errors</i>, centered as it is on the Abbess, as natural
              and fitting. . . .

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            By changing the classical Epidamnum . . . to the Christian Ephesus
              associated with Paul . . . Shakespeare decisively if subtly shifts the generic
              expectations of an Elizabethan audience steeped in Scripture and the liturgical
              calendar from pure farce to something like a divine comedy in which emotional
              experiences and intellectual reflections portrayed by the characters are shared
              simultaneously by the playgoers despite their privileged knowledge of the twinned
              Antipholi and their twinned Dromios.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He finds the mixture of farce and serious Christian spirituality of the morality plays
            influential on <i>Err.</i>, as well as such thematic phrasing as (p.
            48) the strikingly appositive last petition of the litany in the Book of
            Common Prayer, Thoughe we be tyed and bounde with the chayne of our synnes, yet
              let the pitifulness of thy great mercy lose vs, and, from the General
            Confession at Morning Prayer, We ha[u]e erred and straied from thy waies, lyke
              lost shepe.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 50): The wonders of the religious drama highlight the piling on of wonders
              that is the concluding movement of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, yet
              none is more wonderful than this: that so short a play—actually Shakespeare’s
              briefest—moves all the way from the Nativity to the Last Judgment, spanning not only
              the life of the Christian but all Christian history as well. That too is the essential
              idea behind Paul’s letter to the Ephesians and so may also lie behind Shakespeare’s
              choice of scene.</p>

            31 ff.) enlarges the notion of slavery, arising out of the uniquely large number of
            beatings the Dromios suffer, to include de facto slavery: The playwright’s focus
              on de facto slavery widens to encompass the institution of marriage and the
              individual’s ordering of his or her inner faculties. Implicitly Shakespeare poses a
              dramatic question: do the reunions and festive releases celebrated at the end of
                <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> include a remedy for slavery, whether
              of the social, marital, or existential variety? He canvasses <i>Err.</i> criticism to show how the beatings are generally explained away, usually
            because farce invites violence, but he disagrees that the beatings are unimportant. The
            answer to his question above is that the play does provide a remedy, one based on Eph.,
            characterized (p. 54) as Paul’s radical anti-enslavement message. . . . For
              informed playgoers, pertinent passages in Ephesians operate as a subtext in
              Shakespeare’s play, providing a corrective for the enslavement of servants, spouses,
              and parts of the self even when dramatic characters do not expressly voice and act out
              the texts.</p>

              finds no place to repentance, as the Geneva Bible puts it). No time for

              and redemption, which is the principal reason for the interim of delay and reprieve

          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">The Book of Common Prayer</h4>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_hasr1979" class="ref bibl">Hassel</a> (1979,
            pp. 39 ff.) proposes, as part of a larger study on the ways plays were chosen to accord
            with themes of the church year as laid out in the Book of Common Prayer, that <i>Err.</i> is appropriate to Holy Innocents’ Day, 28 Dec., the feast
            commemorating Herod’s slaughter of the children aged two years and under in Jerusalem
            and its environs. <i>Err.</i> was played on that feast in 1594 (Gray’s
            Inn) and in 1604 at court: Error seems to have been the traditional hallmark of
              Innocents’ celebrations. . . . The reason . . . is the centuries-old tradition of
              beginning the Feast of Fools on Childermas or Innocents’ Day. Until the time of the
                <i>Spectator</i>, Innocents was considered for this reason
                the most unlucky day in the calendar, it certainly is so to the
              inhabitants of Ephesus. Even the abundance of ass and ass-head jokes in the play may
              have had elusive connections to the festival tradition, since an ass was
            sometimes led down cathedral aisles, marking Christ’s humility. He grants that this
            tradition was not much used in England and was well suppressed by the middle of the 16th
            c.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 40): A glance at the liturgical tradition of Innocents’ Day makes
              it even less likely that mere nostalgia or coincidence explains the dual performance
              of the play on that religious festival. The repetition of <i>nativitie</i> in the final lines . . . seems to suggest a general awareness of
              the Christmas season. More specifically, as soon as we read the proper
              Lesson [scripture reading appointed for the day] prescribed for Holy Innocents’ Day in
              the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, we are struck by relationships to
              the framing story of Egeon and Emilia, Shakespeare’s unique addition to his sources.
                Jer. 31:1–17 [the Old Testament proper], like the framework
              of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, is about [<i>41</i>]
              the dispersal and reunion of families. In fact, from such other prescribed passages as
                Bar. 4:21–30, Matt. 2:13–18, Rev. 14:1–5, and Isa. 60, we realize
              that this theme was a central motif of the liturgical festival.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Dealing as it does with the Lord’s promise to reunite the dispersed and
              weeping families of Israel, Jeremiah 31 is
              insistently parallel to the first and final scenes of <i>Errors</i>.
              After the Lord’s several promises to gather the remnant of Israel from the coasts of
              the world, verses 15–17, on the ultimate
              deliverance of all innocents, seem particularly close to the situation and the
              sensibility of Egeon and Emilia, parents of their own lost children: <p class="noindent">15 A voice was heard on hie, a mourning and bitter weping,
                  Ra&lt;c&gt;hel weping for her children, . . . because thei were not.</p>
                <p class="noindent">16 Thus saith the Lord, Refraine thy voice from weping, and thine eyes from
                  teares: for thy worke shalbe rewarded, saith ye Lord, and thei shal come againe
                  from the land of the enemie.</p>
                <p class="noindent">17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that thy children shal come
                  againe to their owne borders.</p> In the other prescribed passages the
              theme remains the same: innocents have been scattered or displaced by their enemies,
              but they will eventually be returned home, even if that home is with the Lamb in
              heaven [Rev. 14]. . . .

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>42</i>] That the lords of Gray’s Inn had just been
              absolved of their own guilt by the prince of Purpoole, thus becoming themselves
              mock-innocents and fools, may have heightened both the absurd and the serious
              dimensions of the parallel. They could hardly have hoped to see a more pertinent
              entertainment on the night of 28 December. [It may be objected, however, that
            Psalm 79 and the Collect emphasize death and penitence, e.g., <i>Almighty</i> God, whose prayse this daye the yong innocentes thy witnesses hath
              confessed and shewed forth, not in speaking but in dying; Mortifye and kyll all vyces

            It challenges the older Catholic claim that procreation is the primary
              purpose of marriage with the Protestant view of its true and original purpose:
                It is instituted of GOD . . . that man and woman should liue lawfully in a
                perpetuall friendship ([<i>Certaine Sermons</i>, 1968,] p.
                239). . . . [<i>97</i>] Explicitly contradicting Luciana’s defense
              of the double standard, the homily defines the grand folly of human nature: For
                this folly is euer from our tender age growne [v]p with us, to haue a desire to
                rule, to thinke highly of our selfe, so that none thinketh it meet to giue place to
                another. That wicked vice of stubborne will and selfe loue, is more meet to breake
                and to disseuer the loue of heart, then to preserue concorde (p.
              240).
          </p>
          

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Paraphrasing the homily, he continues: Husbands must strive to be of
              one will with their wives [Eph. 5:21–33], and therefore they
              must become humble. They must be understanding, attentive, and compassionate, and they
              must instruct by edifying example. To be sure, wives too must be meek and humble, and
              they must willingly obey their husbands as Sarah did Abraham—yet the exemplary pattern
              of a husband is not Abraham. In one of the most remarkable instances of the influence
              of Renaissance humanism on Christian thought, the official Anglican sermon declares
              that the ideal husband . . . is the pagan Socrates, who meekly endured
              the euill manners of his shrewish wife so that he might bee the
                more quiet with others, being thus dayly exercised and taught in the forbearing of
                her (p. 247).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It is precisely because the sermon wants to change the older thinking
              about marital roles that it instructs the husband in meekness and patience and
              humility. An indifferent, uncaring, or domi­[<i>98</i>]neering
              husband is not a good Christian. So, he concludes, those who take Luciana to
            be the play’s authority on marriage are wrong. See , for his analysis of Luciana.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh. knew this romance from John Gower, in Bk. 8, <i>Confessio
            Amantis</i>, printed in 1483, 1532, and 1554; from Laurence Twine’s prose version,
            <i>The Patterne of Painefull Aduentures</i> (STC 709, revised <i>STC</i> 709 and 709.5, entered in S.R. 1576); or from both. Sh. apparently
          used Gower (1554) for <i>Per.</i>, as well as Twine’s <i>Patterne</i>, perhaps in an ed. of 1607. The <i>STC</i> entry is
            1594?. That uncertainty is removed in the revised <i>STC</i>. If Sh. used Twine, it would settle the date of composition, but the
          evidence is inconclusive. In Twine, but not in Gower, Apollonius’s wife is named Lucina,
          leading <a href="#b_bulg1957" class="ref bibl">Bullough</a>
          (1957, 1:50) and <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed. 1962, p. xxxi) to mistakenly give her the name in Gower where
          in fact she is nameless. There is no other evidence that Sh. used Twine for <i>Err.</i>
          <i>Lucina</i> looks promising as a hint for Luciana, but the contrasting
          Adriana-Luciana (see ) probably better
          accounts for the name.</p>

            Tyre, which had been retold by Gower in <i>Confessio Amantis</i> (and
            was to influence <i>Pericles</i> years later). [<i>11</i>] The tale has more than one storm at sea, a husband separated from his wife
            and child, and a mother who undergoes strange adventures. . . . Like the Mother in

          p. 95), thinking <i>Per.</i> was very early, compares the description of

          1.1 and calls it a source for <i>Err.</i> In so doing, he points to
             “Apollonius of Tyre,”  without specifying that it is a source for
            <i>Err.</i> That possibility was taken up quite gingerly for a while.
            <a href="#pw_balt1928" class="ref bibl_pw">Baldwin</a> (ed.
          1928, p. xx), without noting Wislicenus or Gower: At least one Greek romance seems
            also to have made a contribution to the play. For part of his setting Shakespeare is
            indebted to the story of Appolonius [sic] of Tyre. There the wife of Appolonius,
            supposedly dead and cast into the sea, floats to Ephesus, where she is revived and
            becomes a nun in the Temple of Diana. . . . It would seem that this nun
            of Ephesus, under the local influence of Holywell Priory . . . came to be the Abbess of
            that institution in Ephesus.
          <a href="#b_chae1930" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> (1930,
          1:311): The <i>Comedy of Errors</i> has elaborated and varied the
            intrigue [from Plautus] and added the enveloping action. Possibly the story of
            Apollonius of Tyre, used for <i>Pericles</i> . . . may have given a
            hint for this.
          <a href="#b_gile1930" class="ref bibl">Gill</a> (1930, p. 56)
          takes it for granted that Sh. used  “Apollonius.” 
          The following points are common to <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>
            and the tale: (1) a storm, a ship split upon a rock, and the father saved on a floating
            bit of the ship (a plank in one instance, a mast in the other), (2) the mother saved
            from the sea (in a chest in the tale, on a mast in the play) and rescued by fishermen
            [she is mistaken; the father is saved by a fisherman], only to be
            separated long years from her family, who also are separated from each other, (3) a
            child lost to both parents, (4) a mother going into retreat in a religious house, of
            which she becomes head, (5) the chance meeting, recognition, and happy reunion of the
            family, (6) the place of the reunion at Ephesus, before a priory in the play, and in a
            temple in the tale. By <a href="#s_kit1" class="ref witness">Kittredge</a> (ed. 1936, p. 133), doubt has ceased.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_tile1965" class="ref bibl">Tillyard</a> (1965,
          pp. 47–8): However stylized and matter-of-fact Roman comedy was, it retained some
            faint trace of its more romantic ancestry through its motives of recognitions of lost
            children, its closeness to the sea, its allusions to shipwreck and pirates. It thus
            connects remotely with the Greek novel . . . however widely it diverged from it.
            Shakespeare exploited this connection by enclosing his Plautine farce [<i>48</i>] in a framework derived from the Greek novel [ “Apollonius of
              Tyre” ].</p>

      





      
        <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Other Sources and Influences</h4>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The extent to which Italian drama influenced Sh. is not fully known or agreed on. What
          follows are the strongest arguments for that influence through either the scripted
          comedies, called <i>commedia erudita</i> early in
          the 16th c. and, with slight changes, <i>commedia
            grave</i> later, or the <i>commedia
            dell’arte</i> or improvised theater, based on stock scenarios acted by
          professional players. The proponents say that Sh. could have found all the non-Plautine
          elements he either invents or imports from romance sources in this Italian theater.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_sarg1897" class="ref bibl">Sarrazin</a> (1897,
          p. 105) suggests that several Italian plays have similar contents without necessarily
          being sources: Trissino’s <i>Simillimi</i>, Cecchi’s <i>Le
            Moglie</i>, and Agnolo Firenzuola’s <i>I Lucidi</i>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_leak1934" class="ref bibl">Lea</a> (1934, 2:434
          ff.) gets around any influence on Sh. himself by accepting <a href="#s_cam3a" class="ref witness">Wilson</a>’s (ed. 1922) hypothesis that Sh.
          revised an old play which, she says, first embodied the <i>commedia dell’arte</i> aspects she details: Certain
            resemblances to the Commedia dell’arte may be accounted for as direct borrowings taking
            place most probably at a pre-Shakespearian stage of development. No single scenario has
            come to light which could be regarded as a source for either of these plays [<i>Tmp.</i> and <i>Err.</i>], but the more we know of the
            nature of the Commedia dell’arte the less we expect the evidence of contact between the
            two dramas to take this form: the scenari should not be studied singly but as they group
            themselves into the stage traditions of the farces of mistaken identity and the comic
            pastorals or shipwreck plays. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The coincidence of the action of the <i>Comedy of
              Errors</i> with all the chief features of the plays of mistaken doubles in the
            Commedia dell’arte is almost complete, but something must [<i>435</i>]
            be allowed for a common inheritance from . . . Plautus. . . . [But t]he scene in which
            the courtesan lures Antipholus of Syracuse in spite of Dromio’s warning [?4.3;
            Antipholus resists her from her entrance], Pinch’s dealings with the madman, Dromio of
            Ephesus announcing his freedom [she is thinking of Messenio; Dromio has no such speech],
            are nearer to the Latin than to any modifications which survive in
            Italian. . . . 
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          But when we come to consider the amplifications of the <i>Menaechmi</i> theme it is obvious that while the classical comedy was
            Shakespeare’s ultimate it was not his immediate model. These amplifications fall into
            three groups: the framework concerning the Duke, Aegeon, and the Abbess; the
            introduction of Luciana as a confidante for Adriana and a wife for Antipholus of
            Syracuse; and the addition of twin slaves which brings about the extra complications of
            the cooling dinner, the lost purse, and the disputes over the rope-end and the
            unpaid-for chain.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She spends several pages hypothesizing three stages of the play, Sh.’s being the third.
          (P. 438): Whoever was elaborating the <i>Menaechmi</i>
            theme in order to produce a farce for the English players seems to have been acquainted
            with the ways in which the comedy of mistaken identity was exploited on the Italian
            stage. The details of the variations played upon the confusion of twin lovers, masters,
            fathers, and servants may be studied in detail in the representative scenari printed in
            the Appendix [not reprinted here]. . . . To have seen the see-saw action of a
              doubles play with its denials, beatings, jeerings, defiances,
            jealousies, and apologies and to have caught up the mere suggestion of doubling those
            doubles would be enough for this diviner of the springs of laughter.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          By status the Dromios of Shakespeare’s play are the slaves of Latin
            comedy, but in behaviour and misfortunes they are the servants of the Commedia
            dell’arte. They are beaten as regularly as any Zanni and for the same reasons. The
            excuses that provoke misunderstandings are ordinary enough, the misdelivery of any

          but concludes that Sh. refined the sentiments of both Plautus and any scenario he (or the
          fashioners of the play which preceded his version) might have seen (p. 442): The
            sympathetic treatment of the women gives some support to the theory that as Shakespeare
            revised he refined. Plautus made Menaechmus’ wife a mere scold; Flavia in Locatelli’s
            version is almost equally wronged by Silvio and she rebounds; but Adriana yields and
            seeks to know her fault. In the Commedia dell’arte the neglected lady who suspects that
            her husband has found some fresh attraction, flames up with jealous anger, but
          Adriana is more grieved than angry.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh.’s additions of pathos and gravity lead us to suspect that already he was
            working away from the farcical Italian material with which the <i>Comedy

          <a href="#b_leak1934" class="ref bibl">Lea</a>’s account
          absolves Sh. of coarseness but encourages studying a more nearly contemporary handling of
          Plautine material than <a href="#b_gile1930" class="ref bibl">Gill</a> (1930), with her closely observed analysis of the Latin, could

          has other general similarities with <i>Err.</i>, as <a href="#b_leak1934" class="ref bibl">Lea</a> shows to be utterly common in
          Italian 16th-c. imitations of Plautus. He grants that the parallels are insignificant,
            but may well be worth mention as between plays of different nationality perhaps
            forty years apart. The clinching point is that in both <i>L’Ammalata</i> and the <i>Errors</i> the long-lost wife or
            mother is a nun in a monastery, famous for her medical skill, the exercise of which
            precipitates the dénouement. As Lea says, there is no good reason to expect to

            have been brisk enough to make disguise as Italian entertainers desirable to foreign
            spies. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>242</i>] Certain features [of <i>commedia erudita</i>] became commonplaces . . . : the cast of
            middle-class families and their servants, pedants, soldiers, innkeepers, friars, and
            courtesans, joined in a series of encounters on the street, in doorways, and at windows;
            the combination of spatially and temporally restricted farcical intrigue with a
            potentially romantic antecedent history; the pattern of misunderstanding, disguise, and
            mistaken identity, kept moving and finally solved by peripeties and recognitions. While
            the playwrights customarily boasted in their prologues of debts to Plautus, Terence, and
            Boccaccio, the pieces they borrowed were reassembled to create a total different from
            the sum of its parts. In the process, they systematically outcomplicated the ancients
            and strained to do as much to one another.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She describes the improvements in the moral tone of the <i>commedia grave</i>, one being an increase in emotional tension (p.
          245): Whatever the proportions, there was always a mixture of sentiment, pathos,
            and danger with lively comic action. The romantic potential in clichés of . . . trade
            wars, shipwreck, and kidnapping, causing separation of families . . . was now developed
            explicitly.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The courtesan often (p. 246) becomes a strikingly more sympathetic
          figure.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The plots grow increasingly complicated. (P. 247): More original than the
            doubling and recomplicating . . . was the use . . . of central themes and
            motifs. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>248</i>] The motif of supposed magic, specifically
            sorcery, alchemy, and astrology . . . in <i>commedia
              grave</i> is tied more closely than before to the language, as well as to
            whatever happens to be the theme for the variations. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The theme of sorcery was frequently used in conjunction with or as a
            variation on the theme of madness.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Concluding, she says that the time for looking for specific, immediate sources for Sh. is
          past (p. 251): There are many Italian regular comedies based on <i>Menaechmi</i>, but there is no reason to suppose that Shakespeare used any of
            them or to doubt that his sources were Plautus, Gower, and St. Paul. His choice of
            elements and his way of blending them, however, give pause. She lists the plot
          elements that find their counterparts in Italian comedy. The combination
            of these elements, characteristic of <i>commedia
              grave</i>, could not have been suggested by Lyly or Gascoigne, for both <i>Mother Bombie</i> and <i>Supposes</i> belong to the
            earlier type of regular comedy. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          It cannot be proved that Shakespeare read Italian plays, or saw <i>commedia dell’arte</i> troupes or Italian amateurs
            at Elizabeth’s court perform <i>commedie
              gravi</i>, or heard about them from a friend. Nor can <i>The
              Comedy of Errors</i> be labelled <i>commedia
              grave</i>, for Shakespeare’s most Italianate play is still not an Italian one.
            It is next to certain, however, that the brilliant young upstart crow knew something
            about the latest Continental fashion in comedy.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_clul1980" class="ref bibl">Idem</a> (1980, pp.
          130 ff.) proposes that <i>Err.</i> is part of a Continental experiment
          in expanding the limits of theater by writing mixed genre plays: In the
            early sixteenth century, when humanistically educated men of letters were producing
            experimental solutions to the problem of defining the classical genres of comedy and
            tragedy for vernacular culture, the <i>commedia
              erudita</i> frequently depended on the principle of <i>contaminatio</i>, of merging two plots, as Terence had defended
            doing in [the prologue to] <i>Andria</i>. . . . The practice of
            conflating individual units of action, character, and language from different sources
            had, even in the early <i>commedie</i>, sanctioned fusions of Roman
            comedy with pieces of the <i>Decameron</i> and Petrarchan
            imagery. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The purpose of the calculated contaminations was to test the nascent rules
            of dramatic art and the possibility of inventing a third regular genre.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She says that it is no longer possible to say that there (p. 131)
            was no important connection between Shakespeare and Italian
            drama. . . . This is a notion that time has hallowed but must now pass by. Its survival
            is made possible only [<i>134</i>; sic – pp. 132–3 contain plates] by
            ignoring the late cinquecento repertory of theatrical structures, generic figures and
            frames, or theatergrams, that are identifiable as movable parts also
            handled expertly and innovatively by Shakespeare. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>135</i>] What needs to be emphasized is not that
            Shakespeare improves upon his materials—no surprises there—but that he does so as if
            participating in the quest for mixed genres, aware of Continental theatrical trends
            while taking advantage of his English license to infringe neoclassical rules and to
            assay bolder variations and mixtures. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>137</i>] In <i>The Comedy of
              Errors</i> the materials he quarried from two Plautine comedies and from a number
            of other nondramatic sources are mixed and developed by the Italianate technique of
            multiple <i>contaminatio</i>, to bring comedy
            near to tragedy without transgressing the neoclassical ground rules, to achieve the
            fullest measure of complexity in pattern and to fit the whole as a metaphor for the
            appearance/reality relation of fortune/providence. She catalogs the elements
          that produce the mixture. Sh. was not adapting a specific Italian play but engaging in a
          Continental approach to comedy.</p>

          denies the influence.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">One strain of supposed influence on <i>Err.</i>, especially in
          accounting for the non-Plautine aspects, is from medieval drama and romance. <a href="#s_cam3a" class="ref witness">Wilson</a> (ed. 1922, on
            <a href="#tln_1142" class="ref lb">1142</a>): It is important to notice that
            S. Dromio’s mind is full of images from the old miracle and morality plays in this [4.2]

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_cogn1950" class="ref bibl">Coghill</a> (1950,

            Donatus, through Vincent of Beauvais (ca. 1250) (p. 4): Comedy is a poem changing a sad beginning into a happy
            ending, . . . a tale of trouble that turned to joy.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          This simple formula is the true basis of Shakespearian Comedy.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">This he calls the Romantic view, contrasted to the Satiric view. (P. 7): The
            Renaissance view of Comedy was entirely different [from the medieval view]. Its only
            concern is ridicule. He cites Whetstone, introduction to <i>Promos
            and Cassandra</i>; Sidney; Puttenham; and <i>Arte of
            Rhetoricke</i>, chap 14.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The reason why Renaissance theory and practice emphasized correction is that (p. 9)
            the older tradition was for Romance, the new world was all for Punishment. For
            the new world had to face the onslaught of Puritanism. If the right of poetry to exist
            at all was to be successfully defended, ethical weapons had to be used. . . . Faced by
            a choice in such matters, a writer is wise if he follows his temperament. Ben Jonson
            knotted his cat-o’-nine tails. Shakespeare reached for his Chaucer.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Though Sh. starts out with Plautus, anyone caring for poetical forms . . . will
            find significant differences in the shapes of the two plays [<i>Menaechmi</i> and <i>Err.</i>]. It is not simply a matter of
            the doubling of the pairs of twins by the exuberant Elizabethan. It is a matter of a
            change of <i>venue</i>, of quality, and of catastrophe. He <i>medievalized</i> the story; he invented a beginning and an end for it,
            starting in trouble and ending in joy.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He describes the Egeon-Aemilia story, the deferral of death, and the means of his deliverance. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          These modifications in Plautine structure can hardly have come about by
            accident or whim. And if by whim, how is it that the new shape should correspond so
            exactly with the medieval view of what is proper to comic form?
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          This new shape brings with it an incidental feature in play-construction,
            in the conventions rather than in the form of English Comedy. It [<i>10</i>] fills the stage with the whole happy cast at the catastrophe. In the <i>Menoechmi</i> [sic] the play closes with the twins and their servant
            [sic] only on stage. Shakespearian and almost all subsequent comic drama in England
            closes with a stage cram full of happy people; the whole world of the play has been led
            into delight, and with it the whole audience.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The changes in venue and structure go with a change in quality. It is not
            simply that there is a general coarseness and selfishness in Plautus’s personal
            relations that is not to be found in Shakespeare. There is a specific and medieval
            delicacy injected . . . by the invention of a romantic sub-plot—the love-affair between
            Antipholus of Syracuse and Luciana. Save for the greater lyrical fluency of Shakespeare
            it is Chaucerian, and its sentiments are those of <i>amour courtois</i>: [quotes <a href="#tln_0821" class="ref lb">821–7</a>].
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          Love as the centre and solvent of all troubles could not absolutely govern
            this Comedy of mistaken identity, but it thrust its way into it and coloured the
            conclusion.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_chah1931" class="ref bibl">Charlton</a> (1931;
          1938, p. 70): Between Plautus and Luciana are the centuries in which chivalry and
            its achievements in life and letters had evolved the love which, like God, makes earth
            and man anew. The world which is enshrined in mediæval romance was embedded in the
            inherited experience of the sixteenth century. Even when he was recoiling from
            romanticism, Shakespeare could not divest himself of the romantic. And so these alien
            elements are stuffed within his imitation of a classical play.</p>

            Mercy central in the miracle plays, but in sixteenth century drama it lay dormant until
            Shakespeare, with some apparent incongruity, brought it life once more in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_sall1974" class="ref bibl">Salingar</a> (1974,
          pp. 26, 59, 65–6): In broad terms, the romantic elements in his plays spring from
            the Middle Ages, while his sense of comic irony stems from the Roman playwrights and his
            feeling for comedy as festivity expresses the culture of the renaissance. It was a
            decisive mark of his genius as a playwright that he could bring into unity this
            diversity of traditions.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 59) Writing about  “Egeon and Apollonius,”  he thinks that Sh.’s
          acquaintance with Greek romances from such collections as the <i>Golden
            Legend</i> was wide and influenced him.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 65): As stories involving the extraordinary reunion of twin brothers, both the
            Clement and Eustace legend are related to Plautus’s <i>Menaechmi</i> . . . ; and it seems likely that Shakespeare remembered both legends
            when constructing his own play. The way Egeon’s family has been separated—the rock
            splitting their mast after the shipwreck, the two ships each rescuing one of the parents
            and one of the children, but unable to join, and then the grown son leaving his father
            to find his brother . . . —recalls the father’s tantalizing, successive losses in the
            Placidas [i.e., Saint Eustace] story; while Shakespeare’s dénouement—the prepared
            execution transformed into a scene of rejoicing—could have been suggested to him by the
            similar ending devised by Barnabe Riche. And the dénouement . . . also borrows from the
            Clement legend (as well as from <i>Apollonius</i>, which Shakespeare
            is following to the extent of locating his play at Ephesus and making the mother an
              Abbess there). In the Clement legend, Peter’s enemy, Simon Magus
              (Simon the enchanter), wishing to escape from execution as a magician,
            casts his own appearance on Clement’s father—in Caxton’s translation, he
              imprinted his similitude and likeness in this old man Faustinian, in such wise that of
              every man he was supposed to be Simon Magus; with the result that, although
            the sons recognise their father’s voice, they would run away from him but
            for St Peter’s intervention. Egeon meets with a similar [<i>66</i>]
            incomprehension from Antipholus of Ephesus, just before the other twin comes back on the
            stage: [quotes <a href="#tln_1775" class="ref lb">1775–91</a>]. There is nothing like this in the Apollonius story; but transformation
            by strange means, the proximity of an enchanter or conjurer . . . , the
            quasi-biblical setting and the danger of an execution are details all common here to the
            play and the saint’s legend. Here, then, where Shakespeare is bringing to a climax the
            tale of Egeon as a man tried by fate or Providence over a period of many years, it is
            clear that he is not following one narrative source alone but fusing scattered incidents
            together from a broad tradition of exemplary romance.</p>

            wife], however, the image changes. The earliest recorded performance . . . was
            for the [<i>317</i>] members of Gray’s Inn on Holy Innocents’ Day, 28
            December 1594, in connection with the annual revels of the Lord of Misrule. Although the
            play was probably performed before 1594 on the public stage, its selection for the
            revels may tell us something significant about Shakespeare’s comic art.</p>

            represented by Egeon and Antipholus of Syracuse and in the implied past and future—that
              <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> draws its confusion and its resolution.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He marshals scholarship that shows Sh. adapting the medieval drama in tragedies and
          history plays. (P. 42): The form and features of the mystery cycles are pervasive
            in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. The cycles began with serious
            treatments of the fall (and death) of Adam (needing, like Egeon, to be
            saved in the person or representative of Christ), moved into knockabout farce with plays
            on Cain and Abel (much as we witness with the treatment of the two Dromios), and then
            restored high seriousness in showing how Christ’s love conquered travail and sin (as
            with the increasing seriousness of the final scenes of Shakespeare’s play). Even
          the staging of some cycle plays, where neutral playing places served for simultaneous
          staging and took on moral signification, makes <i>Err.</i> familiar. (P. 43): Following these plays, <i>The
              Comedy of Errors</i> depicts a representative mankind falling into confusion;
            distracted by worldly things (like a cloak and a chain [he is confusing <i>Menaechmi</i> here]) of a mercantile world, such as the merchants of Ephesus whom
            St. Paul addresses; and vulnerable to desire (for an unnamed courtesan or Luciana) as
            the witchcraft Paul sees in Ephesus marked the Ephesians.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_coxj1989" class="ref bibl">Cox</a> (1989, pp.
          61, 66–7): One of the consistent qualifications of socially differentiated style in
            Shakespeare’s early comedies is their openness to vestiges of medieval dramaturgy. If
            the well-made comedy was a sign of power, then Shakespeare’s early comedies deconstruct
            not only the well-structured play but the social assumptions that gave rise to the
            ruling idea of such a play in the first place.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He discusses the distinction between the romantic frame plot and the main
          plot. (P. 66): In the context of this consistent distinction between the
            two stories . . . , we can see unmistakable allusions to the archetypal medieval drama
            that historically underlay the romantic plot. The romantic pattern of separation,
            wandering, and reunion, as David Bevington points out, derived directly from the moral
            pattern of fall from grace, temporary domination of evil, and rediscovery of divine
            favor—the structure that enabled travelling actors to adapt the vast drama of salvation
            history to the exigencies of a small troupe. What is therefore the oldest story in
            English drama permeates the language of the frame plot and contributes to its
            qualitative distinction from the newly fashionable classical action that it encloses.
              My fall is the play’s first rhyme phrase, followed closely by
              the doom of death: Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall / And by
              the doom of death end woes and all ([<a href="#tln_0005" class="ref lb">5–6</a>]). I am not partial to infringe our
              laws, the stern duke insists, identifying himself with harsh perpetrators of
            the old law in medieval dramatic renderings of the history of salvation
              ([<a href="#tln_0008" class="ref lb">8</a>]). Those who have not been able to
              redeem their lives before the duke of Syracuse have seal’d his
              rigorous statutes with their bloods ([<a href="#tln_0013" class="ref lb">13</a>]). The familiar romantic dilemma of shipwreck, global wandering, and years
            of familial separation is thus reinforced with vestiges of the ageless theological
            dilemma of the fall of humankind and the law of sin and death. Occurring exclusively in
            the frame story, these casual hints add texture to other differences between it and the
            Plautine story.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Archetypal drama is again implied in the play’s
            conclusion. . . . Liberation from error and the threat of death are physically enacted
            when Emilia recognizes Egeon: [quotes <a href="#tln_1825" class="ref lb">1825–6</a>]. He adduces Egeon’s ransomless freeing and
          the born again metaphor of <a href="#tln_1896" class="ref lb">1896</a>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> . . . is more of a hybrid than it
            appears to be at first, and the social implications of its style are therefore
            ambiguous. Its neoclassical plot and elegant economy represent an attempt to appropriate
            fashionable standards, and authorially such an attempt inevitably suggests a desire for
            the power and prestige that these standards represented—just as certainly as lower-class
            violation of Elizabethan sumptuary laws represented a desire for the status ascribed to
              upper-[<i>67</i>]class clothing. While this pursuit of status is most
            apparent in Shakespeare’s earliest comedies (and is probably strongest in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>), it is a strategy for social mobility and
            preservation that Shakespeare never entirely abandons. . . . On the other hand,
            Shakespeare does not press this stratification as hard as he might, and he qualifies it
            dramaturgically in ways that soften and even reverse its social impact. The most
            effective image of renewed community . . . is presented by the servant twins as the
            play ends. In contrast to the enmity and discord [<a href="#tln_0009" class="ref lb">9</a>], the rancorous outrage [<a href="#tln_0010" class="ref lb">10</a>] with which the action begins and the classical plot
            compounds, the frame story concludes with the two Dromios walking amiably to a waiting
            feast.

              Shrew</i>, is entirely mediæval, and was imported into those plays by Shakespeare
            from the examples furnished to him in Lyly’s <i>Endimion</i>, in which
            the action is affected by the agency of fairies, witches, enchanted fountains, and human
            beings transformed into trees. From Lyly, too, Shakespeare took the idea of [<i>82</i>] the underplot, in which some well-marked character, not
            absolutely necessary to the evolution of the main plot, is brought on stage to amuse the
            audience with his oddities and witty abuse of language. In <i>The Comedy
              of Errors</i> this part is filled by Dromio of Syracuse, and the following
            specimen of dialogue . . . will, when compared with the extract I have given from
              <i>Mydas</i>, furnish ample evidence of the cause of the change in
            Shakespeare’s comic manner: [quotes <a href="#tln_0443" class="ref lb">443–502</a>].</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">John Lyly’s influence appears to have been considerable. <a href="#s_ard1a" class="ref witness">Cuningham</a> (ed. 1907, p. xxxvi) first
          notices that a Dromio appears in <i>Mother Bombie</i>. <a href="#b_bram1955" class="ref bibl">Bradbrook</a> (1955, pp.
          50–1): The classic setting, with its three houses, the bewildering
            symmetry of the reduplicated twins harmonize with the quibbles and cross-talk, which is
            at times (as in the dialogue on Time and Hair between Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse
            in Act II) even more pedan­[<i>51</i>]tic than Lyly. It is also,
            however, a great deal more improper than Lyly, and this reflects the current taste of
            the young men who enjoyed the poems of Donne. . . . In doubling the twins, Shakespeare
            improved Plautus. This is a characteristically florid Elizabethan device; they liked
            adjectives in pairs, clauses in antitheses, and Lyly always provided at least two of
            everything.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_bulg1957" class="ref bibl">Bullough</a> (1957,
          1:9): <i>Mother Bombie</i> is a play of duplicated effects and
            symmetry. It has no fewer than four comic servants who are sent on errands and then
            searched for by their masters (II.2), and it contains mistaken identities and lost
            children. Though no close analogue to our play, it supplied the name of its genial rogue
            who says: I have nothing to live by but knaverie, and if the world grow honest,
              welcome beggerie.
          <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed. 1962,
          pp. xxxiii ff.): There is no doubt that Shakespeare knew the elegant prose plays of
            John Lyly. . . . Of these plays, <i>Mother Bombie</i>, printed 1594,
            but acted probably in 1590, has closest affinities with <i>The Comedy of
              Errors</i>, as being modelled on Roman comedy, though its plot, in which a group
            of four gay and witty servants to four old men conspire against them in helping to
            forward the love-schemes of their masters’ children, is Terentian, rather than Plautine.
            One of the servants is named Dromio, and Shakespeare may have borrowed the name from
            this play. [fn.: It should be noted . . . that this name is a variant of <i>Dromo</i>, a type-name for a slave in several of Terence’s comedies.]
            His debt to Lyly, especially in the exchange between the Dromios and their masters, is
            too general and pervasive, however, to be reduced to a list of borrowings. It is
            possible to point to a number of phrases or images in Lyly’s works which recur or are
            echoed in Shakespeare’s play; for instance, I have noticed the following in <i>Mother Bombie</i>: beg him for a fool ([1.1.37; <i>Err.</i> 315]); the image of vine and elm ([1.3.124; 568]); of pulling a
            crow ([2.1.82; 744]); of the parrot crying rope ([3.4.57–8; 1326]);
              I had thought to have askt you ([4.1.36; 694]); there’s a time
              for al things ([5.3.15; 458–9]); sing til we catch cold on our
              feet ([5.3.88; 661]); but some of these are proverbial, and some are to be
            found in other authors of the period also. The number of such echoes has a cumulative
            weight, especially when, in addition, Shakespeare employs [<i>xxxiv</i>]
            formal devices he learned from Lyly, and in the mock dialectics of II.ii, and again in
            the catechism of III.ii, recalls similar passages in <i>Midas</i>.
            Lyly’s influence is felt finally in the tone of much of the comic dialogue, the
            cadences, the cheerful quibbling insolence of the servants, and the casual equality of
            speech between servant and master, who may nevertheless turn sharply on his
              villain at any minute.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">But <a href="#b_hung1962" class="ref bibl">Hunter</a> (1962,
          pp. 300 ff.) thinks otherwise: The intrigue of <i>The Comedy
              of Errors</i> . . . shows an interest in patterning human behaviour, setting one
            level against another, which was an art in which Lyly was the obvious
          master.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          Whatever area of common ground Shakespeare shared with Lyly’s mode in
            comedy, there can be little doubt that the earliest Shakespearian plays show interests
            which are quite divergent from Lyly’s. . . . But the interest of the relationship is
            not . . . to be measured by a list of parallel passages. . . . I suppose that the
            point of comparing Lyly and the early Shakespeare is not to find out what Shakespeare
            took from Lyly. . . . What may be a more fruitful as well as a safer process is to seek
            a standpoint from which we can see the young Shakespeare <i>differing</i> from his models. . . . 
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>The Comedy of Errors</i> would seem to show
            Shakespeare’s natural tastes in comedy at a point where he had not absorbed [<i>301</i>] (or else absorbed and then rejected) the influence of Lyly.
            The play is . . . largely dependent on its [Plautine] sources . . . , and if we are to
            compare Lyly’s work with Shakespeare’s it would have to be in the additions and
            alterations to the originals. He lists the non-Plautine elements.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 302): Either Lyly’s influence has been so absorbed at the beginning of
            Shakespeare’s career that it does not show, or else it exercises little or no power. I
            take it that the latter is [more likely].</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Luciana brings a wholly non-Plautine atmosphere to the play, but not necessarily one
          founded on Lyly.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          I cannot find . . . that the scene where Antipholus woos
            Luciana marks a basic or pervasive break with tradition, or that Lyly is to be held
            responsible for its manner. It shows us the fairly obvious comedy of the innocent
            abroad, and of the man who protests too much—though in language of a new eloquence, I
            admit. What is new in the poetry is not its Lylian elegance . . . but rather the strong
            pathos of man’s loneliness, and this is something that runs counter to Lyly’s flippant
            and detached view of the man in love.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The frame story of the shipwreck not only has its immediate source in  “Apollonius of Tyre”  but also reflects a more general influence of romantic tales
          that appealed to contemporary taste. <a href="#b_andh1904" class="ref bibl">Anders</a> (1904, p. 107 and n.) suggests that Menaphon, the name
            (<a href="#tln_1855" class="ref lb">1855</a>) of Solinus’s uncle, came from
          Greene’s romance <i>Menaphon</i> (<a href="#tln_1589" class="ref lb">1589</a>), or possibly from Marlowe’s <i>1 Tamburlaine</i> (printed
          1590); see n. <a href="#cn_1855" class="ref note_cn">1855</a>. <a href="#s_ard1a" class="ref witness">Cuningham</a> (ed. 1907,
          p. xxix) points out that a figure called Antiphilus . . . is one of the heroes in
            Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i>. The word means mutual
            affection.
          <a href="#b_bulg1957" class="ref bibl">Bullough</a> (1957,
          1:9): In Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i> Lib. 2 Antiphilus, beloved by
            Erona . . . , falls in love with someone else. When King he justifies polygamy and is
            slain by women. Perhaps Shakespeare was thinking ironically of this when he had to name
            his henpecked and not-very-faithful or affectionate Citizen.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_stad1945" class="ref bibl">Starnes</a> (1945, p.
          1022) thinks Apuleius’s <i>Golden Ass</i> lies behind the emphasis on
          witchcraft and sorcery in <i>Err.</i>, elements that are not found in
            <i>Menaechmi</i>—though they do appear in <i>Amphitruo</i>, which Starnes does not deal with—and are behind Dromio’s fear that
          he has been transformed into an ass.</p>

          pp. 673–4): Shakspere could . . . hardly have been ignorant of either Marlowe’s or
            Greene’s Menaphon. And now appears a further significant fact. For in Greene’s <i>Menaphon</i> there is a shipwreck which parts the husband from the wife
            and infant son. Then pirates later steal the son from the wife. . . . [<i>674</i>] Here, I think, is certainly where Shakspere got his suggestion
            for parting the family bilaterally by shipwreck, and then later parting the mother from
            her son by marauders, and finally reuniting the family, in which Menaphon . . . is
            caused to play his part.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_tres1958" class="ref bibl">Trenkner</a> (1958,
          pp. 106–7) traces folk motifs in the Greek novella and subsequent literature. She
          discusses the prevalence of the lost twin brother story that is said to underlie <i>Menaechmi</i> and its sources: The chief adventure of the
            twin brothers, that is the mistake in identity made by the wife (and not the mistress as
            in the <i>Menaechmi</i>) is nearer to the folk-lore versions of the
            twins story in Shakespeare than it is in Plautus. Antipholus shrinks from her advances
            while Menaechmus has no scruples in responding to them.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The doubling of the pair of twin brothers by the pair of twin servants is
            another innovation made by Shakespeare. This concept is usually said to have been lifted
            from the <i>Amphitryo</i>. . . . Yet the nature of the identical
            pairs and the ensuing complications are different in the two plots. She points
          out differences. (P. 107): But even if this scene [3.1] . . . is a
            reminiscence of the <i>Amphitryo</i>, the conception of two sets of
            twins cannot be derived from Plautus. Its obvious source is the folk-tale in which
            identical brothers are accompanied on their adventures by identical servants (dogs,
            horses, etc.). . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          Shakespeare found the non-Plautine elements of the <i>Comedy
              of Errors</i> in current tales. By dovetailing these into Plautus’ plot, he
            returned to the primary source from which the Greek original of the <i>Menaechmi</i> is derived.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_broh1961" class="ref bibl">Brooks</a> (1961, pp. 64–5): Hence, when through his neo-Plautine
            warp Shakespeare ran a weft dyed in colours of romance, he was making no extreme change
            from the Latin genre as then frequently understood. Rather, he was overgoing Plautus,
            and Terence, on their supposed romantic side, as well as on that of comic intrigue. For
            this purpose, and for copiousness, he drew on additional sources. The
            leading interests of romance—as one might exemplify from Arthurian romances, from <i>The Squire’s Tale</i>, or, coming to the period of our play, from the
            romance aspects of <i>Arcadia</i> and <i>The Faerie
              Queene</i>—were adventure; marvel, especially enchantment; the high sentiment of
            love, and <i>sens</i>, the implications brought
            out in the <i>matière</i>, the meaning the
            reader takes away with him, as a result of the author’s treatment. Shakespeare develops
            into an adventure-story, that of Egeon, the successful quest for the long-lost child
            which in <i>Menaechmi</i> [<i>65</i>] is hardly more
            than a presupposition of the plot. For the initial peril demanded by a plot of this
            kind, he provides by translating from hoax into fact the situation of the Sienese
            merchant in Gascoigne’s <i>Supposes</i> where it was already part of a
            drama of mistaken identities; and by heightening it from a potential threat to goods
            into a provisional sentence of death. The shipwreck and intervention of piratical
            fishermen, whereby, Egeon narrates, the family was first divided, have a probable source
            in Greene’s <i>Menaphon</i>, and form a link with the source of the
            happy ending, the adventures of Apollonius of Tyre, related by Gower and Twine.
          He summarizes the relevant narrative in  “Apollonius.” 
          The interest of adventure is not confined to the <i>dénouement</i> and the opening scene; through the alien Antipholus
            it is carried into the main action. To him it seems that he has a series of adventures
            with the supernatural. His thoughts and feelings about them, like the providential
            coincidences that have brought all the members of the family to Ephesus, speak to our
            sense of marvel. His illusion of supernatural menace in these experiences is set against
            the real peril of Egeon, and against the truth of his love, even though his
            love-adventure, which brings the loftiest of love-sentiment into the comedy, seems to
            him supernatural and at least equivocally perilous too. In the idea of the town as a
            home of supernatural delusion, Shakespeare is again combining sources. The Epidamnum of
              <i>Menaechmi</i> (II.i) is notorious for cheats. The denizen’s house
            there is associated by Shakespeare with Amphitruo’s, a scene of supernatural
            shape-shifting. Epidamnum itself has changed to Ephesus, no doubt as the site of Diana’s
            Temple in the Apollonius story, which becomes his Abbey. Diana of the Ephesians
            inevitably recalls Acts XIX, whence Shakespeare would remember,
            besides the uproar on her account, the references to curious (that is, black) arts
            practised in Ephesus, and to the exorcists, with whom Dr. Pinch (founded on the Medicus
            in <i>Menaechmi</i>) has something in common. The Ephesians are warned
            against supernatural foes in St. Paul’s Epistle, which also exhorts them, Geoffrey
            Bullough reminds us, to domestic unity, dwelling on the right relationships of husbands
            and wives, parents and children, masters and servants. With the father’s rebuke to the
            wife in <i>Menaechmi</i>, and the long tradition of marital debate in
            mediaeval and Tudor literature, it thus contributed, no doubt, to the <i>sens</i> of the play.</p>

            and doubtless thus the fable was transmitted to Shakspeare. This play is

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">This entry led to various guesses that this play, also lost, was a source for <i>Err.</i>
          <a href="#b_colj1831" class="ref bibl">Collier</a> (1831,
          3:62–3): On new-year’s night 1576–7, the children of Paul’s acted <i>The History of Error</i> at Hampton Court. This fact is recorded by Malone, but
            he has not remarked also, that it was repeated on Twelfth-night, 1582–3; for although by
            mistake, in the account of the Revels at that date, it is called  “A
              History of <i>Ferrar</i>” , the person who made out the list of
            plays, writing from the sound only [i.e., from dictation], meant probably the same piece
            as the <i>History of Error</i>. This play may have been the foundation
            of Shakespeare’s <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, and the circumstance, that
            he borrowed certain parts from the old <i>History of Error</i>, will
            explain all that the commentators have said regarding doggrel verses, and the apparent
            authorship of two different persons in the same play.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">A few years later, this hypothesis had hardened. <a href="#s_col1" class="ref witness">Collier</a> (ed. 1842, 2:109): The fact, no doubt,
            is that the clerk who prepared the account merely wrote the title by his ear. Thus we
            see that, shortly before Shakespeare is supposed to have come to London, a play was in
            course of performance upon which his own [<i>Err.</i>] might be
            founded. This astonishing fiction, based on a putative dictation, soon enters
          into the lore surrounding some antecedent version of <i>Err.</i>, e.g.,
            <a href="#s_stau" class="ref witness">Staunton</a> (ed.
          1857, p. 111): The same [Revels] accounts contain an entry, under date of 1582–3,
            which may be assumed to refer to this play, although the title, through the ignorance or
            carelessness of the scribe, is misprinted,  “A Historie of <i>Ferrar</i>” .</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Feuillerat (p. 469) objects to <a href="#s_col1" class="ref witness">Collier</a>’s inferences: He is somewhat bold in affirming that his
            own conjecture is not doubtful. The man who wrote the books [i.e., the Revels accounts],
            though he sometimes does make mistakes, was certainly not an unintelligent man (his
            spelling is consistent and not extravagant); and, from several errors already
            noticed . . . it is, on the contrary, most probable that he wrote by his copy and not
            by his ear. It is more simple and more natural to suppose that  “Ferrar”  may have been one of the principal <i>dramatis personæ</i>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">One or both of these <i>ur</i>-<i>Err.</i>s is accepted
          as almost certainly some kind of textual half-way house between the drama of
            Plautus and that of Shakespeare (<a href="#s_cam3a" class="ref witness">Wilson</a>, ed. 1922, p. 74), by <a href="#b_ulrh1846" class="ref bibl">Ulrici</a> (1839, tr. 1846, p. 260), <a href="#s_ard1a" class="ref witness">Cuningham</a> (ed. 1907,

          correct: Nor can I attach much importance to the suggestion of an old text derived
            from the Paul’s court play of  “The historie of Error”  in 1577,
            perhaps through Sussex’s court play of  “A historie of fferrar”  in
            1583. We know nothing about these plays except their names. Obviously Paul’s might have
            adapted a Plautine play and called it <i>Error</i>. But there [<i>309</i>] are many kinds of error. They might also, for example, have
            produced a moral with Error as a character. A Paul’s play is not likely to have proved
            very suitable for Sussex’s men. . . . And Sussex’s fferrar looks to me
            very much like Ferrara. I see no reason to suppose that the Revels clerk
            made up his accounts from dictation. Certainly the scenery provided for the
          performance does not seem Plautine.</p>

          Antipholus and S. Dromio from the others, returning the first group to Syracuse and

            inconsistencies of detail or inaccuracies in reference to distant and unfamiliar
            places. But Foakes goes on to summarize the issues, and so do I.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh. changed the location of <i>Err.</i> from the Epidamnus of Plautus
          to Ephesus, and he decided to tell a shipwreck story to get everyone there. Furthermore,
          he particularizes the shipwreck by naming cities: Ephesus (<a href="#tln_0020" class="ref lb">20</a>), Epidamium (<a href="#tln_0045" class="ref lb">45</a>), Corinth (<a href="#tln_0090" class="ref lb">90</a>), and Epidarus (<a href="#tln_0096" class="ref lb">96</a>), all of which are real, not made-up names,
          locatable on one currently available map (Ortelius) and in <a href="#b_coot1565" class="ref bibl">Cooper</a>’s (1565) Latin dictionary.
            (Epidamium is usually emended to Epidamnum, itself the
          accusative of <i>Epidamnus</i>, the form of the
          word on the map and in Cooper. Epidarus is Epidaurus.)</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The shipwreck is usually understood to have occurred in the Adriatic or rather the Ionian
          Sea east of Syracuse (a city on the southern coast of Sicily), somewhere close to the Gulf
          of Corinth. That locale presents the problem that <a href="#s_irv" class="ref witness">Marshall</a> (in <a href="#s_irv" class="ref witness">Irving</a>, ed. 1888, pp. 109–10) describes, commenting on

            that, of <i>Epidarus</i> this, referring to the two ships that
          tried to rescue the survivors clinging to the mast, soon to be split: This line
            seems to require a little geographical explanation. The <i>Epidaurus</i> . . . was . . . situate in Argolis on the Saronic Gulf [i.e., a little
            south of Corinth]. . . . Corinth had two ports, Lechæum on the Gulf of Corinth [i.e.,
            the western port] and Cenchreæ on the Saronic Gulf [the eastern port]. A ship, bound to
            or coming from the latter port, would come by the same course as one sailing to or from
            Epidaurus; and they would meet the floating mast . . . outside the Ionian Islands [on
            the western edge of the Gulf of Corinth]. . . . Ægeon tells us that the storm commenced
            when they were a league from Epidamium [<a href="#tln_0065" class="ref lb">65</a>]; so that . . . the mast . . . must have travelled some
            considerable distance to have reached any spot near the entrance of that gulf.
          Epidamium (Epidamnus) is a city, now Durrës (also called Durazzo), in Albania, some 250
          miles north of the entrance to the gulf.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">To this long journey must be added the fact that there was another Epidaurus north of
          Epidamnus (now Dubrovnik in Croatia), so that one of the ships may have come from there,
          closing in from the north on the Corinthian ship coming up from the south.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh. had available to him quite confusing information about this geography. Central to

          read the <i>Menaechmi</i>, he would have found the following
          information. Glossing Plautus’s Prologue,  “EPIDAMNVM DEVENIT,” 
          Lambinus says, Dyrrachium venit. Sed Steph. de
            vrbibus docet duas Epidamnos esse, vnã in Illyrico, alterã in sinu Ionio (He came to Dyrrachium [Durazzo]. But Stephanus in
            his  “On Cities”  teaches that there are two Epidamnuses, one in
            Illyria [Durazzo] and one on the Ionian gulf). But Cooper apparently describes
          only the latter Epidamnus as a towne in the southeweste parte of Greece on y<sup>e</sup> sea syde, called afterward <i>Dyrrachiũ</i>. The trouble is, there was no such Achaian Epidamnus. So Sh.
          learned that Epidamnus was either north in Illyria or southwest in Achaia.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Of Epidaurus <a href="#b_coot1565" class="ref bibl">Cooper</a> says, A citie in Greece in the coũtrey called Achaia, wherin

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">After the separated families are picked up, Egeon and his lot return to Syracuse on the
          east coast of Sicily, and Æmilia and her lot, at first picked up by men of <i>Epidamium</i> (<a href="#tln_1841" class="ref lb">1841</a>), then separated by rude Fishermen of <i>Corinth</i> (<a href="#tln_1843" class="ref lb">1843</a>), made their way
          eventually to Ephesus; Æmilia was left with those of <i>Epidamium</i> (<a href="#tln_1845" class="ref lb">1845</a>), i.e.,
          presumably Epidamnus, so how she got to Ephesus is hard to imagine if the shipwreck
          occurred in the Adriatic, or Ionian, Sea.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">This is the position originally taken by <a href="#pw_balt1928" class="ref bibl_pw">Baldwin</a> (ed. 1928, pp. 118–19): Now the
            circumstances of the shipwreck are apparently impossible geographically. For these
            people, wrecked only three miles from Epidamnum [he is using the form <a href="#s_pope" class="ref witness">Pope</a> substituted for
            Epidamium], start drifting directly for Corinth, some four hundred miles away. Not only
            do they have a four-hundred-mile objective, but they have a physical impossibility,
            since their direct course would force them to float overland. This float
            [across the isthmus to Corinth] [<i>119</i>] would appear even more
            impossible in old maps than actually it was. Too, the scattering family is taken up by
            fishermen of Corinth and vessels from Epidaurus and Epidamnum. Evidently Shakespeare
            thinks of Epidamnum as being near Corinth and Epidaurus, seemingly near the western end
            of the Gulf of Corinth. This impossibility leads him to a fantasy of imagining a
          first version of <i>Err.</i> that would take place in Plautus’s
          Epidamnus, and a second that shifts events to Ephesus with Sh. not noticing the
          inconsistencies the shift occasioned. He withdrew the theory in <i>On Act
            and Scene Division</i> (1965, p. 149).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#pw_balt1928" class="ref bibl_pw">Baldwin</a>
          judges that Sh. had no map that would help him visualize Egeon’s tale; instead, Sh. relied
          on Lambinus, <a href="#b_coot1565" class="ref bibl">Cooper</a>, and Acts 19:19, which helped him decide
          on Ephesus as the right setting for <i>Err.</i>
          <a href="#b_parg1940" class="ref bibl">Parks</a> (1940)
          proposes just such a map, one showing Saint Paul’s journeys, in Abraham Ortelius’s <i>Theatrum orbis terrarum</i> (1570 and later; see <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a>, ed. 1962, Frontispiece; map,  of this edition, and <a href="#cn_1841a" class="ref note_cn">n. 1841–7</a>). Parks shows flaws in Baldwin’s no-map argument (p.
          94): These books are in fact insufficient. In the former [Lambinus], Epidamnus is
            of course identified, but no other names would naturally be suggested in connection with
            a play confined to that city. In the latter [Cooper], Epidamnus is also given, and
            Ephesus preceding it; but the Epidaurus given is the more famous one on the east coast
            of Greece, not the one Shakespeare had in mind. All that either book could have given
            would be the identification of Epidamnus. Neither would of itself have suggested the use
            of Ephesus. Parks barely hints that Sh. probably chose Ephesus for reasons that
          had nothing to do with maps or dictionaries.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In Ortelius, Sh. would have found all four E-name cities listed in the (p. 95)  “Nomina . . . Antiqua” : The Epidaurus is moreover the right one,
            in Illyria, and it is defined in such a fashion as to stick in the memory. That is, it
            is identified as the modern Ragusa [Dubrovnik], a city well known in England as a vassal
            state of the Turk and the home of the argosy or Ragusan ship. On the map all the
          cities necessary are prominently named save for the nearly invisible Ephesus, just to the
          right of the isle of Samos in the Aegean sea.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_parg1940" class="ref bibl">Parks</a> admits he
          cannot prove that Sh. consulted this map, but he argues that it was available and was (p.
          97) the leading atlas of its time.
          <a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> (1947, p.
          689 n.) rejects Parks on the grounds that Sh. is not known to have seen Ortelius’s
          map.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_balt1965b" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> (<i>Genetics</i>, 1965, pp. 147 ff.) thinks the wreck took place in the
          Aegean, and he invents a town in Asia Minor called Epidamium located somewhere close to
          Ephesus. This is a breathtaking solution once one gets past the boldness and the (usual)
          opacity and incompleteness of the explanation. It depends, though he never says so, on the
          phrase from Stephanus locating a second Epidaurus <i>in sinu Ionio</i>. This phrase, normally understood as
            on the Ionian gulf, Baldwin silently takes to mean, as it can, in
            the winding coast of Ionia,
          a dist[rict] in the W[est] coast of Asia Minor, extending from Phocæa to
            Miletus, an area that includes Ephesus (<a href="#b_suge1925" class="ref bibl">Sugden</a> [1925, s.v. Ionia], quoting
            <i>Ant.</i> 1.2.107 [191], And to
            Ionia). It also depends on emphasizing the Asia Minor setting of the play,
          especially Fiue Sommers haue I spent in farthest <i>Greece</i>,
            Roming cleane through the bounds of <i>Asia</i>, And coasting homeward,
            came to <i>Ephesus</i> (<a href="#tln_0135" class="ref lb">135–7</a>), where Sh. is following Plautus closely but
          misunderstanding Graeciamque exoticam, the Greek settlements
          in southern Italy (see n. <a href="#cn_0135c" class="ref note_cn">135–7</a>).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In this work, too, <a href="#b_balt1965b" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> gives Sh. a map, one attached to Acts in the Bishops’ Bible
          (1573) that labels the cities Paul visited on his missionary journeys. (P. 147):
            Now [referring to his chapter 9 where he explains the Asian setting] that we have
            located farthest <i>Greece</i>, the genetics of the
            geography of <i>Errors</i> becomes clear. Ephesus and Epidamium are
            close together in Ionia. Corinth and Syracuse occupy their actual positions, as does
            Ephesus. We have left only Epidaurus, which comes into <i>Errors</i>
            with Corinth. Neither Epidamnus nor Epidaurus is on the biblical map, since they are not
            mentioned in the Bible story.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The only possible Epidaurus for Sh. is the one near Corinth, since (p. 148)
            this . . . is the only one known to Cooper, and the only one really known in
            Shakspere’s day. . . . [<i>149</i>] Shakspere’s Epidamium was not in
            Illyricum but alongside Ephesus in Ionia, farthest <i>Greece</i>,
            Greece of Asia. I have not omitted any part of his argument that
          Sh. invented this Epidamium—which after all is a made-up word somehow based on Epidamnum.
            This location makes plain sailing of Aegeon’s shipwreck
            and the sequent wanderings of the family. In <i>Menaechmi</i>, the
            merchant who stole the twin was of Epidamnus. Being alongside the commercial Ephesus in
            Ionia of Asia, Epidamium was thus a natural place for Aegeon (made a merchant as was the
            father of the twins in <i>Menaechmi</i>) to establish a foreign
            business. In a straight line with each other on the biblical map attached to Acts are
            Siracusa, the place of departure in <i>Menaechmi</i> and retained in
              <i>Errors</i>, Corīthus [he uses the orthography of the map], and
              Ephes<i>us</i>. . . . The map would indicate a straight route from
            Syracuse to Ephesus, with only a slight neck of land to negotiate at Corinth, and this
            map would be compulsorily available along with the story for grammar school boys of
            Shakspere’s day. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The location of Epidamnus <i>in sinu
              Ionio</i> by Stephanus and Lambinus had placed for Shakspere Epidamium in
            Ionia . . . alongside Ephesus. Sailing from this nonexistent Epidamium . . . on the
            Aegean Sea was not [<i>150</i>] lightly to be undertaken. Here
          he recounts ancient warnings about the danger of sailing the Aegean. Most important,
          having the wreck north of Corinth on the Aegean makes sense of And floating
            straight, obedient to the streame, Was carried towards <i>Corinth</i>,
            as we thought (<a href="#tln_0089" class="ref lb">89–90</a>; see n. <a href="#cn_0089a" class="ref note_cn">89</a> [<i>straight</i>] there, where the streame is identified as a
          well-known current falling out of the Black Sea southwest into the Aegean), whereas a
          wreck on the Adriatic causes the difficulties already noted. <a href="#b_balt1965b" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> must think that
            Epidamium was somewhat north of Ephesus, which on the maps of Ortelius
          and the Bishops’ Bible itself seems to be a bit north of Corinth across the Aegean, though
          in fact it is a bit south.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The only notice <a href="#b_balt1965b" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> gives that he has completely changed his mind about in sinu Ionio is (p. 149): Since these locations are
            derived directly, it is not necessary to review the discussions of Epidamnus in
            Illyricum, to which, following the excellent lead of Irving and Marshall, I have
            contributed my share, a wry glance at his 1928 edition. No edition to date has
          incorporated Baldwin’s bold invention of this nonexistent Epidamium.</p>

          (ed. 1774, p. 81): <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> does not very
            obviously produce a moral, but we may deduce from it, that Providence can happily
            regulate the most perplexed and unpromising circumstances, and change a temporary
            apparent evil, into a real and lasting good. Patience and submission are herein justly
            and properly inculcated.</p>

            There is a sentiment of great propriety and delicacy argued upon; in the
            dissuading a person from the commission of an unseemly action, even though the thing
            itself might be sufficiently justified in one’s own breast. A respect to decency, and
            the opinion of the world, is an excellent bulwark to our virtues.</p>

          171): In a letter to Goethe, 25 Apr. 1797, Schiller praises <i>Err.</i>
          as the best example of an exposition that is already part of the development of the
          play.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_scha1815" class="ref bibl">Schlegel</a> (1809–11, tr. 1815, 2:158): Once we grant the first twinning,
          the second is acceptable (we shall not perhaps be disposed to cavil at the
            second); because the senses must be appealed to, masks were surely used to make
          up for the lack of truth; I cannot acquiesce in the censure that the discovery is
            too long deferred; so long as novelty and interest are possessed by the perplexing
            incidents, there is no need to be in dread of wearisomeness; in such plots you
          cannot get away from some lowness, but Sh. has however endeavoured to ennoble it in
            every possible way. A couple of scenes, dedicated to jealousy and love, interrupt the
            course of perplexities which are solely occasioned by the illusion of the external
            senses; Egeon’s exposition expertly informs the spectators of what the
          characters do not know. In short, this is perhaps the best of all written or
            possible Menæchmi; and if the piece be inferior in worth to other pieces of Shakspeare,
            it is merely because nothing more could be made of the materials.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Some early critics object to the premise of perfect twinness that <a href="#b_scha1815" class="ref bibl">Schlegel</a> solves by the use of masks:

            bestowed no great pains on it [<i>Err.</i>], and there are but a few
            passages which bear the decided stamp of his genius. He seems to have relied on his
            author [Plautus], and on the interest arising out of the intricacy of the plot. The
            curiosity excited is certainly very considerable, though not of the most pleasing
            kind. . . . In reading the play, from the sameness of the names of the two Antipholises
            and the two Dromios, as well from their being constantly taken for each other by those
            who see them, it is difficult, without a painful effort of attention, to keep the
            characters distinct in the mind. And again, on the stage, either the complete similarity
            of their persons and dress must produce the same perplexity whenever they first enter,
            or the identity of appearance which the story supposes, will be destroyed. We still,
            however, having a clue to the difficulty, can tell which is which, merely from the
            practical contradictions which arise, as soon as the different parties begin to speak;
            and we are indemnified for the perplexity and blunders into which we are thrown by
            seeing others thrown into greater and almost inextricable ones.—This play . . . leads
            us not to feel much regret that Shakespear was not what is called a classical scholar.
            We do not think his <i>forte</i> would ever have lain in imitating or
            improving on what others invented, so much as in inventing for himself. . . . [<i>352</i>]—The only passage of a very Shakespearian cast . . . is the
            one in which the Abbess, with admirable characteristic artifice, makes Adriana confess

            they are but because of what they are. . . . [The four twins] exist for no other
            purpose than to be mutually mistaken. They may groan and seem to go mad in their
            perplexity, but we only laugh the louder; for it is the figure that gestures, not the
            man, and our expectation indeed is that the playwright will strain his ingenuity still
            further in the invention of new tortures, provided new ones are possible. . . . If
            Shakespeare’s spirit reposed in comedy it was not in this kind of comedy. He could write
            it very well and be hugely funny; but the heart of his interest was elsewhere, and the

            But . . . the convention here is handled in a humorous way because it does not
            appeal wholeheartedly to our acceptance. It is quite willing that no one should take it
            very seriously. We can almost see the playwright’s tongue in his cheek. One intimation
            of this confessed unreality . . . is that the characters are more or less aware of it.
            Their reactions when faced with the painful or ridiculous consequences to themselves of
            an absurd imbroglio are not quite those of flesh-and-blood people under the shrewd or
            humiliating blows of fortune; they grow most amusing when most persecuted by
            fate. . . . But it is plain . . . that everybody is out to make the huge joke a
            success. We are the more inclined to think so, as the playwright, who after all pulls
            the wires, displays such genuine knowledge of human nature, moves his puppets with so
            much unfeigned liveliness, keeping the interplay of temperaments and the animation of
            dialogue at such high pitch. How superior he is to his own subject! . . . A pleasant,
            though not deep, comedy of character is thus founded on a basis which our instinct knows
            to be unsafe, but which no one minds as the author does not really try to pass it off
            upon us under false pretenses.

              men’s, Shakspeare, has in this piece presented us with a legitimate farce in exactest
              consonance with the philosophical principles and character of farce, as distinguished
              from comedy and from entertainments. A proper farce is mainly distinguished from
              comedy by the license allowed, and even required, in the fable, in order to produce
              strange and laughable situations. The story need not be probable, it is enough that it
              is possible. A comedy would scarcely allow even the two Antipholises; because,
              although there have been instances of [<i>115</i>] almost
              indistinguishable likeness in two persons, yet these are mere individual accidents,
                <i>casus ludentis naturæ</i> [accidents of
              playful nature], and the <i>verum</i> [truth]
              will not excuse the <i>inverisimile</i>
              [improbability]. But farce dares add the two Dromios, and is justified in so doing by
              the laws of its end and constitution. In a word, farces commence in a postulate, which
              must be granted.</p>

              of laughter lie almost wholly in the situations and incidents, hardly at all in the
                charac­[<i>66</i>]ters. The spectator of the play is called on
              to accept much that is improbable . . . for the sake of mere fun and
              laughter-stirring surprises. So cleverly, however, are the incidents and persons
              entangled and disentangled, so rapidly does surprise follow surprise, that we are
              given no time to raise difficulties and offer objections. . . . [<i>67</i>] To Shakspere belongs wholly the serious background, from which the
              farcical incidents stand out in relief. . . . There is a fine passage, full of
              pathos, and almost in Shakspere’s later dramatic manner, where the old man, a prisoner
              before the duke, finds that his son does not recognise his face, nor remember his
              voice [<a href="#tln_1775" class="ref lb">1775–1803</a>];
              but such passages, in which character or human passion rather than incident chiefly
              interests us, are rare.</p>

              Coleridge [above] we say that this has the air of special pleading; and we distrust it
              the more because of its categorizing farce apart from comedy and giving it laws
                of its end and constitution. As a matter of history, and even of
              nomenclature, farce and comedy never have been and never can be divided into
              compartments with separate literary laws. . . . Who ever made these categories or
              gave them laws? . . . There is no line of demarcation—all such lines,
              or attempts at them, are a professional humbug of criticism. In literature it is all a
              question of tact. The author persuades us into the right mood. . . . We see no point
              at all in praising the <i>Errors</i> above the <i>Menaechmi</i> as the high water mark of elaborate farce in its highest
                signification. It might (though we doubt it) have come near to deserve such
              praise had Shakespeare not set his artificial farce between the romantic-realism of
              the distressed merchant . . . and of the long-lost wife reclaimed. . . . We should
              prefer to say that in this early play Shakespeare already discloses his propensity for
              infusing [<i>xxii</i>] romance into each or every form
              of drama; that unique propensity which in his later work makes him so magical and hard
              to define. But, as yet, farce and romance were not one form but two
              separate stools; and between them in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> he
              fell to the ground. We should add, however, that we have never seen it on the boards,
              for it is seldom staged. There is some evidence that it acts
              well—which, after all, is the test—and even that it provokes uproarious
              mirth.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_chae1926" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> (1926,
            pp. 25–30) takes a middle ground. It is true that there is some interest in the
              ethical problems which hinge upon jealousy and that it is comedy in the
              true sense of a criticism of life, which is at heart profoundly serious, and employs
              all the machinery of wit or humour, with the deliberate intention of reaching through
              the laughter to the ultimate end of a [<i>26</i>] purged outlook upon
              things. Let an audience shake its sides at the plight into which a scold is brought by
              the railings of her tongue, and it is odds that they will go away with the conviction
              that the wiser course is not to rail. . . . From one point of view, then, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is to be classed as a comedy. But if
            you strip the play of its ornaments of the romance plot and the ethics of
            jealousy, the interest declares itself as almost entirely one of plot. He
            then distinguishes two senses of farce, one merely a variety of comedy which, despite
            its roughness, still is interested in character, the second being one in which (p. 28)
              the interest of character is wholly replaced by an interest of plot. The
              conception of farce in this sense may be defined as the deduction of a logical
              conclusion from absurd premises. The playwright starts with some impossible
              assumption, which you must take for granted; however unconvincing, however grotesque,
              it is beyond your criticism. From this he proceeds, without any further breach of the
              probabilities, to show what follows, and to work out a resulting tissue of
              absurdities, all inherent in the initial situation.
            <i>Shr.</i> and <i>Wiv.</i> belong to the first
            kind, <i>Err.</i> to the second, though there is a (p. 29)
              qualification, namely that although the Ephesian twins do not know they
            have identical looking brothers, the Syracusan twins must have been told by Egeon of the
            fact, hence it is almost incredible that, when they found themselves being
              obviously and constantly mistaken at Ephesus for persons not themselves, the solution
              of the puzzle should have failed to suggest itself to them. Likewise Egeon
            should have figured out why he was repudiated by someone looking like his Syracusan son.
              There are therefore . . . two assumptions, not one, made in the play; an
              assumption of physical [<i>30</i>] resemblance so close as to be
              mistaken for identity, and an assumption also of a very singular kind of oblivion in
              at least two of the personages. Against the second assumption we are
              entitled to protest.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_broh1961" class="ref bibl">Brooks</a> (1961,
            p. 70): Dynamic progress is strongly felt in the mounting violence, from the
              first mere thwack to the drawing of swords, thrashing with a rope’s end, overpowering
              of madmen, and elaborate (narrated) vengeance upon Pinch; in the
              spreading of error beyond the family to courtesan, goldsmith, and merchant, until the
              whole town, at least in Adriana’s fevered fancy, seems involved; and in the darkening
              conviction of the imaginative Antipholus that his supernatural experiences are from
              the devil. With this explanation, natural to his melancholy temperament, he has
              positively encased himself in error, for it is as coherent as it is fallacious. In
              like fashion his choleric brother comes to attribute all his sufferings to a
              conspiracy instigated by his wife: both the Antipholi reach the verge of
              persecution-mania. Since Adriana also is given her point of view, which alters before
              the end, one can say of the three main persons that although they do not develop in
              the sense of being felt to change in character as a result of the action, their
              attitudes of mind develop, so that each is felt to have an inner self. That is, they
              are not wholly flat characters, such as might be fitting protagonists of pure farce.
              They are simple, but have just enough depth for the play, which Shakespeare, as we
              have seen, has deepened considerably beyond the expected limitations of neo-classical
              comedy.</p>

              or counter-plotting in a Machiavellian sense. The sole plotter is the playwright, and
              whatever that ingenious trickster hatches is fobbed off on us as a trick of fate, a
              practical joke on the part of providence. For here the mistaken identity is not
              deliberately cultivated through impersonation or disguise . . . ; it is a freak of
              nature, <i>lusus naturae</i>, which Coleridge
              advises us to accept as a postulate. And Coleridge philosophizes . . . about farce,
              distinguishing between it and proper comedy as the basis for a distinction between the
              possible and the probable. A set of identical twins, leading different lives,
              constitutes an improbable possibility. The distinction is sometimes drawn in terms of
              character and plot: farce tends to subordinate the former to the latter.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh.’s doubling of the twins presses the limits of possibility. If that was a
              reduction to absurdity, absurdity is man’s lot as the Existentialists have redefined
              it, and what should a farce be if not wholly absurd?</p>

            25): It [<i>Err.</i>] is in fact two plays, a farce and a
              comedy, most expertly synthesized. Farce, essentially mechanistic, requires that we
              look on all of the dramatis personae from outside. . . . But Shakespeare presents
              characters from the inside, that is to say he depicts people who have stumbled into
              the world of farce and do not understand its laws. The farce play here is merely the
              record of the mechanical errors based on mistaken identity. The comedy is the study of
              the reactions of the characters to the farce in which they find
              themselves. . . . There are . . . two major objections to terming <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> a farce; the frame to the action, pregnant with
              tragedy, and the fact that the characters consistently refuse to be
              mechanized.</p>

            pp. 166–7, 177): Recent critics . . . make much of Antipholus’s
              declaration of love and connect it with Egeon’s sentence of death, the addition of
              Emilia, Antipholus of Syracuse’s soliloquies on identity, and the family reunion to
              show how Shakespeare deepened his source play. Implicit in their
              argument is an understanding of farce as some lesser form in a hierarchy of genres,
              inappropriate to Shakespeare’s genius; so they set out to show how even his first
              comedy goes beyond the limitations of farce by adding such topics as
                death,
              love, or identity that have special value in
              themselves. . . . If indeed themes can have value apart from the way they are
              dramatized, one might respond that in this play the experiences of love and marriage
              serve to develop the theme of what constitutes identity. Had Shakespeare intended to
              develop such an ideal relationship between man and woman, he missed his chance in Act
              V, where Luciana and Antipholus of Syracuse could have expressed their sentiments. Yet
              they remain completely silent. . . . [<i>167</i>] I question whether
              the farce is to be praised because of its serious issues. Surely the
              problem for analysis is to show how Shakespeare puts such topics to comic
              uses. . . . Isn’t it the very power of farce to transmute potential threats and
                serious themes to matters for laughter and joy? Shakespeare appears
              to be testing the power of his story by the very lengths to which he adds what would
              otherwise be serious. Rather than separate the comic
                intrigue and comic rhetoric from the themes, we should ask
              how it is that themes, quite serious in other contexts, become the stuff of
              farce.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The neo-classical principles of sixteenth-century humanists cannot
              satisfy all our questions about the dynamics of comic attitudes, but they can prevent
              us from overemphasis on sentiments of love or sympathy for a condemned father, a
              misunderstood wife, or a beaten servant. . . . Farce affords its distinctive
              pleasures that arise from its very limitations. It has the power to make us laugh at
              cuckolds, shrews, beaten servants, unpaid goldsmiths, unjust laws, even potential
              incest. Shakespeare did indeed change and add to his source play, but to make it more
              the kind of drama that it is, not to romanticize or soften it. . . .

              Dromios . . . as best they can, carry out the offices of servant, and strangely it is
              because they are unjustly punished that we laugh. . . . We laugh not because we

            (1975, pp. 84 ff.) says that comedy usually searches for truth: It is surely
              noble to argue that comedy is a mode of combating the tendency of the human mind to
              harbor faulty knowledge. Nevertheless, the comedy of truth is not all the truth about
              comedy. Undeniably, the ends of comedy are often served by a quest for clarification
              and wisdom; and this quest may reasonably be considered the analogue of a series of
              laboratory experiments. But a razor-edged awareness of the illogical stresses and
              strains in human thought and conduct is not the whole preoccupation of comic energy.
              Whereas satiric comedy . . . delights in the laughing murder of untenable ideas,
              ironic comedy treats ideas only as colorful or [<i>85</i>] intriguing
              toys. Farcical comedy is more devastating: it promotes a subversion of mind itself by
              seeking out the powerful pleasures of irrationality. And humorous comedy not only
              tolerates man’s proneness to make mistakes, but even cherishes his fallible biases and
              pieties.</p>

              roulette table suggests well enough that the nonsense in Shakespeare’s comedy has its
              boundaries: it leaps about within a patterned chanciness and a comparatively polite
              ambience. It [<i>92</i>] is no step toward nihilism and no summons to
              festive riot. Thus <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> does not exemplify
              Levin’s assertion that the carnival spirit is the first
                condition of comedy, comedy itself being a release from the rules, a
                dispensation from the routine duties of existence. . . . <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> may break the rules of inference, but it does not open
              the floodgates of carnival. . . .

            In Shakespeare’s comedy of ignorance, error arises chiefly from optical

              certain recurrent formal elements . . . using only the standard vocabulary of
              formal play description such as even the playwrights of the sixteenth century could
              have recognized, namely ethos to mean set of
              beliefs or value system, and muthos to mean plot
            (p. 30).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The coexistence of ethos and muthos can provide a formal matrix not only for
              that kind of play in which the valued man sets himself against society but also for
              that in which the valued society succeeds in taming or expelling the irritant or
              objectionable individual.
            <i>Hamlet</i> illustrates the first, comedy the second.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 31): In the mode of farce the individual cannot
              exercise ethical choice [i.e., the ability to choose a set of beliefs
              or value system] but must intrigue continuously just to
              survive. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>33</i>] The effect of such farcical structures on
              Shakespearian comedy is not hard to discover. In the Shakespeare comedies that are
              closest to the farce mode—<i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, <i>The Merry Wives of
                Windsor</i>—we see marked structural similarities linking one play with
              another. . . . All three plays show their central characters—the Antipholi, Kate,
              Falstaff—hounded by plots that, moving fast and furious, force them to run just as
              fast. The worlds they are found in demand that they accept an ethos that they barely
              understand and that they would rather exploit than accept. Their careers are marked by
              a series of attempts to impose themselves on an environment that can only regard them
              as aberrant. And being aberrant they are too weak to succeed in their impositions. One
              is a puzzled foreigner. . . . Energy, willfulness, determination to keep on moving,
              may allow the protagonist to win the occasional battle, but he or she is bound to lose
              the war, for all the eventual advantages lie with the social body. . . . [<i>34</i>] In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> each
              discovery by an Antipholus that the world is alien is complemented by an assurance
              that it is familiar and welcoming. . . . The unceasing and manic energy of farce in
              these plays comes from the central characters’ unrelenting determination to reject
              complicity with the world around them. But we can see well enough that complicity is
              the only fate available. The unity of the play’s world demands that the opponents
              finally admit that they belong to one another. Antipholus of Ephesus rejects with a
              torrent of vituperation the kindly-meant diagnosis of Doctor Pinch, wife, and
              neighbors; but the community is not put off by his rejection. They think of his
                madness as simply the deprivation of their normality,
              their efforts being bent entirely toward what they see (properly enough) as his
              recovery of full status as a healthy and accepting member of society.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The plots of these plays are generated out of the opposition between
              individual self-assertion and the ethos of a coherent social group. . . . In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> the opposition between the mercantile world
              of Ephesus and the merchants from Syracusa turns out to be only an error.

            pp. 77–8, 81) asserts that farce is a worthy genre, and critics ought not to try to make
            serious what is funny: For many years the earliest comedies were treated
              unapologetically as farces and Shakespeare was praised, if mildly, for his skill at
              contriving such brilliant and pleasing trifles.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">But in the last three or four decades he has been rehabilitated. <a href="#b_mcdr1988" class="ref bibl">McDonald</a> proposes to (p. 78)
              argue that Shakespeare’s taste was not invariably elevated. He does so
            in the interest of canonicity, to avoid deforming <i>Err.</i> to make
            it conform to a more elevated state, and by embracing farce he thus adds to Sh.’s
            range.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He surveys the evasions that critics have devised for treating Shakespeare’s
              efforts in farce, with concentration on the dodges applied to <i>Errors</i>. This he does usefully, granting in footnotes that such
            criticism often has broadened our understanding of the play.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">His own straightforward study of the play’s theatrical action proposes to
              identify the playwright’s strategies for the production of meaning in farce.
            His analysis does not look very different from others that show artful complexity at
            work, except that he usually emphasizes that all the artfulness is designed to produce
            laughs, not some deeper and therefore more acceptable emotions.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 81): To a great extent, the comedy of <i>Errors</i> arises
              from the number of barriers Shakespeare has erected to thwart the normal
            movement in comedy to reconciliation. The greatest obstacles arise in the
              principal characters’ relations with their servants, in the arena of commerce, and in
              the realm of speech itself. Shakespeare generates amusing conflict by exaggerating the
              forces that separate people and by weakening the media that connect them.</p>

            pp. 119–20): Already in his youth Shakespeare moved in a world in which Marlowe
              was not at home and showed no signs of ever wishing to be at home. The comedy is
              middle-class and Plautine and farcical, and so uncharacteristic of Shakespeare: for
              the earliest play that really shows us the shape of Shakespearian comedy to come is
                <i>The Two Gentlemen</i>. But already in <i>The
                Comedy of Errors</i> there is the sense of fun without reference to the
              correction of manners, the fun of a man who in certain moods finds the vagaries of
              human nature and human life a theme for amused and sympathetic comment. In the grief
              of the jealous wife Adriana, which breaks the bonds of the Plautine convention, there
              is more than a hint that to this dramatist comedy is to be not merely comedy of
              humours or manners, but profound comedy, and that women are to play as [<i>120</i>] prominent a part in it as men. We shall not expect to find,
              in this middle-class setting, in this whirl of mistaken identity, examples of the
              conversation of men and women of good breeding, of the exquisite social tact which by
              nature or nurture was at [his] command; . . . yet am I being merely fanciful in
              seeing anticipations of this gracious world of courtesy and civility in such a chance
              phrase as: Sir, I commend you to your own content [<a href="#tln_0195" class="ref lb">195</a>]. In all this Marlowe had no share.</p>

            pp. 134–5) opposes a too-narrow definition of comedy, stressing that the invention of
            Egeon is more important than that of Luciana: The timelessness and
              placelessness of the Shakespearian comedy find their appropriate background in the
              arousing of an atmosphere which continually hovers between life’s phenomena and the
              phantasmagoria of the dream—the one inextricably mingled with the other. [<i>135</i>] Throughout the plays, from the earliest to the latest, we
              can trace this. We start with the queries in <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i>: What, was I married to her in my dream? Or sleep I
                now? [<a href="#tln_0577" class="ref lb">577–8</a>] and If this be not a dream I see and hear [<a href="#tln_1864" class="ref lb">1864</a>]. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Inevitably, all of this means that the characters in Shakespearian
              comedy assume a form utterly different from those in the other types of comedy. Even
              although the persons are ordinary and appear before us in a crowd, the play of humour,
              associated with the other elements dependent upon it, offers us the illusion of a
              living quality in its very strangeness.

              rational play (comedies are rational, tragedies
              non-rational, but each is mixed with the other). Sh. places more
            emphasis on women than Plautus would allow, fostering the nonrational knowledge,
              a kind of knowledge one acquires by processes we call experiential or intuitive
              rather than ratiocinative; hence it is a kind of knowledge which a Western author can
              allow to women as well as to men—and even more readily to his women, since women
              according to Western tradition have fewer rational powers to get in the way of
              whatever intuitive powers they may happen to possess.</p>

              wooing at cross purposes, love at first sight, that is, instantaneous conversion to
              the religion of love, commits Antipholus of Syracuse . . . to a lifelong, ennobling
              devotion to his lady. Unfortunately, his lady is Luciana, who believes him to be her
              own brother-in-law and thinks his pledges of love the utterings of a mind vilely
              deranged. Emboldened by the fervor that the religion of love inspires, however,
              Antipholus protests his regeneration by the power of love [quotes <a href="#tln_0826" class="ref lb">826–7</a>].</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">This admixture of the religion of love and classic farce with the
              resultant transformation of love farce into the romance of marriage exemplifies the

            pp. 3–4, 8, 18–19): The market-place atmosphere of Plautus is still
              present, but it no longer monopolizes the play; it is varied by suggestions of fantasy
              and mystery, and the result is a mixture of styles that goes much deeper than changes
              from verse to prose, or the varying of metres. It is a mixture of different ways of
              viewing the world, of which different dramatic styles are ultimately a reflection. Nor
              is the decision to mix idioms in this way artificially imposed; it springs from
              Shakespeare’s own fresh and imaginative meditation on the central idea of Plautus, the
              idea of confusion. . . . And in exploiting the situations arising from [confusion],
              Shakespeare demonstrates that confusion, the gap of understanding between one mind and
              another, can exist at a deeper level than who’s-got-the-chain or which-twin-is-it-<i>this</i>-time. . . . The characters seem at times to inhabit
              different worlds, different orders of experience.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Some of this effect is created by the mingling—and, at times, the
              collision—of dramatic styles. In II.ii Adriana, meeting the man she thinks is her
              husband, attacks him passionately for straying [<i>4</i>] from
              her. . . . Taken out of context, the speech is passionate and earnest. . . . But the
              context is all-important. Adriana’s speech follows immediately—with no transition
              whatsoever—a racy comic turn between Dromio and Antipholus on time, falling hair and
              syphilis; she breaks in on two characters who are operating in quite a different
              dramatic world. And any chance we might have of making the transition from one mode to
              the other and taking Adriana’s speech seriously is killed by the fact that all her
              high talk about the closeness of the marriage bond is directed at the wrong
              Antipholus. On <a href="#tln_1224" class="ref lb">1224–33</a>, Here, the attitude of each character is comically
              dislocated. The courtesan is simply living her casual, material life, while Antipholus
              is struggling between heaven and hell. . . . The contrast is driven home, once again,
              by the different styles of speech—the casual chatter of the courtesan, the explosive
              horror of Antipholus, and on the side, Dromio’s more familiar recognition of the
              powers of evil. . . . </p>

              [E. Antipholus] inhabits, disruption may be fun for the audience, but it is unsettling
              and unpleasant for the victim. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>18</i>] The play presents a story starting from a
              fantastic premise and moving to an almost equally fantastic conclusion. But at the
              same time, for all its artificiality, it deals with the most normal and intimate
              relations of life—wives and husbands, parents and children. In comparing the different
              worlds the Antipholus brothers inhabit, we saw an intersection of the special and
              fantastic with the normal and everyday—Ephesus as a town of sorcerers, and as a town
              of merchants. The same intersection of the fantastic and the normal becomes part of
              the audience’s own experience as it watches the play—a strange and stylized fable
              built out of the most familiar relationships of life. The result of this interweaving
              of the fantastic and the everyday is to make us see each kind of experience from the
              perspective of the other—just as Antipholus of Syracuse is brought to see the ordinary
              tradesmen as Lapland sorcerers [<a href="#tln_1194" class="ref lb">1194</a>], or the Abbess sees the coincidental rejoining of a long-sundered
              family as an event as natural as childbirth. The comic strategy of the play is one of
              dislocation, forcing us to see [<i>19</i>] experiences from a fresh
              perspective, reminding us that no one understanding of life is final. The mixed
              dramatic mode gives shading and variety to what could have been a one-note, mechanical
              farce; but it also embodies a comic vision of the instability of life
            itself.</p>

              about the initial avoidance or displacement of the idea of death, the cognition and
              recognition of one’s own mortality—and then, crucially, the acceptance, even the
              affirmation, of that mortality. In a sense . . . what we are speaking of is a process
              of neutralization, in anthropological terms a removing of the experience of death from
              a sacred to a neutral zone—a desacralization, a normalization, a refusal to privilege
              death. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">One significant hallmark of Shakespeare’s comedies [<i>122</i>] is that no character ever brought to life in them will suffer death by

              everyday. . . . The bound Egeon is such a figure, framing the comedy with a visual
              emblem of mortality. The mechanics of farce . . . is given a somber tinge by the
              ironic juxtaposition of the play’s first two scenes. S. Antipholus does not
            inquire about the threatened Syracusan merchant. Such self-[<i>123</i>]absorption, the play suggests, may lead to death—one’s own or

            The surface life of Ephesus . . . is firmly in the control of the

              which has resulted in a law which is inhumane but legitimate, and is thus an example
              of that principle in an oppressive form. Aegeon’s lack of money (power) traps him in
              the law, and as a result, his life is forfeit. The Duke, who represents this set of
              values, is moved by Aegeon’s story, but insists he may not disannul
                ([<a href="#tln_0147" class="ref lb">147</a>]) the law. Nevertheless, at the
              end . . . he does precisely that: there is no mention of the fine at the end. This
              change cannot be attributed to a psychological shift in the Duke; it is a result of

            The two gender principles appear at their worst at the opening of the

              is oppressive, inhumane. And the world depicted is an unhappy one: a husband and wife
              quarrel with each other; a husband is unfaithful; a wife is jealous and rebellious;
              servants are brutalized; greed and competitiveness imbue male relationships. The bonds
              linking this society are codified into law, but law does not keep E. Antipholus from
              frequenting a courtesan, Adriana from feeling resentment, masters from beating their

              play rather than the William Shakespeare whom we believe on good authority to have
              written <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. This playwright
              is not the real-life author but the idealized figure whose nature and activity the
              play itself implies. The rationality of this playwright is
              not . . . to be taken for granted—on the familiar if radically untenable assumption,
              for example, that Shakespeare always knows what he is doing—but is
              itself at stake in the play. The achievement of a <i>rationale</i> for <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, and thus of
              a rational identity for the playwright, requires both that the arbitrariness of the
              play’s inherited conventions and the farcical character of the comedy of mistaken
              identity in some measure be redeemed. I will suggest that in the process of
                redeeming the play, and thus himself, the playwright assumes no fixed
              identity, but rather hesitates between two identities, that of God and that of the
              Good Physician.</p>

              purge melancholy, impart self-knowledge, and exorcise psychic demons.

              establishment of Elizabethan commercial drama. By the time of Shakespeare’s play there
              was a well-founded professional theatre in London with a considerable repertory and a
              sophisticated technique to express the nuance of individual experience. And
              Shakespeare draws directly on this inheritance in handling his story of old Aegeon,
              the despairing father of a disintegrated family who is brought into <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> to confront the hard-headed world of Plautine
              farce. . . . In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> . . . we begin not
              with the society [of the <i>Menaechmi</i>] but with the intruder and
              victim, old Aegeon, and in the light of his experience we see the traveller less in

              fiction to be tolerable as a guide to action. But Shakespeare apparently is happy to
              suggest that the factual details of our experience cannot be extricated from the
              explanatory matrix of our romantic fictions. <i>The Comedy of

              continue to fulfill in cultures all over the world. With respect to the material
              environment, it establishes an imperial project that expands the emerging capitalist
              economy at the same time that it satisfies the particular economic needs of unlanded
              gentlemen. With respect to controlling ideology, it articulates that material project
              in terms appropriated from the traditional code of chivalry. With respect to
              individual psychology, it gives men a cautiously negotiated distinction from women and

            contrasts Sh.’s Roman works with his Greek ones, the Roman plays marked by the
            centrality of Rome itself, with its disciplined sternness, and the Greek plays, marked
            by voyaging. She reviews contemporary attitudes toward Greek culture (its democracy was
            bad; it loved adventure at the expense of maintaining a disciplined polity; its morals
            were slack), and believes Sh. imbibed these characterizations. Her focus is on the sea
            (p. 121): The temptation of the sea toward fantasy . . . does not always produce
              delusion and disaster. The willingness to venture forth on the seas even at great risk

              Greek setting, expressed in the Sicilian Antipholus’s gentle lament: [quotes <a href="#tln_0199" class="ref lb">199–204</a>]. Equally
              heroic, if perhaps less fanciful, Egeon has sailed to farthest Greece, /
                Roaming clean through the the bounds of Asia ([<a href="#tln_0135" class="ref lb">135–6</a>]) in search of his son.
              Moreover, in the Greek comedies, unrestrained fantasy gives rise to delightful
              confusions of identity and amusing suggestions of downward metamorphoses in
              atmospheres of geographical wonders. In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>
              with its exotic place names [sic] (Centaur, Phoenix, Porpentine), fantasies about
              sorcery, witchcraft, and demonic possession threaten to veer out of

            (1939–40, pp. 98–102, 106): Aegeon’s opening sorrow is immense, not the result of
            circumstance but is constitutional. On the whole, his story takes hold of us. His
              emotion helps to float the strange episode of the mast that served as a helpful
                ship (line [<a href="#tln_0106" class="ref lb">106</a>]) to save the
              lives of six, and then to divide them nicely into the two triads required by the plot.
              But the author fails to bring out unmistakably the sole aspect of the tale that could
              render it fully plausible, namely its weirdness or uncanniness. Certainly this note is
              present, but not explicitly enough. . . . Relatively too much stress is placed on the
              pathos of the romance, and too little on its weirdness. This error is not made in the
              final scene of the play. There the pathetic joy of the recognition and
              reunion . . . is skilfully intermixed with the characteristic comedy of this
              drama.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The second scene is artfully attached to the first. (P. 99): The fine
              point . . . is that his [S. Antipholus’s] very air [of gravity] is felt to be <i>fathered</i> by Aegeon’s, though quite different. The old man’s
              voluble gloom gives place to the son’s sober sadness. And this humour
              (mood) is susceptible of lightening . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_0182" class="ref lb">182–4</a>]. Thus the mood . . . is
              modulated in the direction of mirth. . . . Note the comic irony of his I will
                go lose myself (line [<a href="#tln_0193" class="ref lb">193</a>]),
              repeated . . . just as Dromio of Ephesus enters to take him for his brother. Superb
              is the sudden but carefully prepared plunge, here, into the comedy of
              errors. . . . The closing speech of the scene and act is notable. Antipholus
              soliloquizes: [quotes <a href="#tln_0261" class="ref lb">261–8</a>]. [<i>100</i>] This sounds the note of weirdness;
              which, however, is not fully brought out till the close of the second act.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Meanwhile (II, i) high comedy [i.e., comedy of character], centred in
              Adriana, comes upon the scene. From now on, it gleams through the pattern of the play
              like a thin gold thread, appearing and disappearing. Adriana is comically
            impatient. That [louring (<a href="#tln_0362" class="ref lb">362</a>)] look
              goes along with conduct, potentially at least, violent. And certainly the
              heroine . . . has her full share in its mad doings. Yet louring impatience is merely
              on the surface of her; deep beneath is a devoted, yearning love for her
              husband.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The pathos of Adriana is subordinated; we are amused by her exaggerations, especially
            her great blaze of jealousy at <a href="#tln_0363" class="ref lb">363–91</a> when she hears about Antipholus’s behavior.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Her confrontation with the wrong Antipholus, 505–39, is especially fine. (P. 101):
              How direct and powerful is the style here over against the neat, conventional
              rhetoric of the preceding quotation. . . . Here the pathos, by itself, would be too
              keen for comedy. But it is checked for us, even as Adriana speaks, by the amazed looks
              of her two Syracusan listeners, wondering what it is all about; and it is submerged by
              the mirth, madder than ever, that ensues.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Other points that he makes: Dromio’s report of the spherical Nell (p. 102) is a
              superb burlesque of the wooing of Luciana by S. Antipholus.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">S. Dromio and his master are overcome by a dreamlike sense of transformation
              [quotes <a href="#tln_0583" class="ref lb">583–7</a>],
              romantic in the master, grotesque [quotes <a href="#tln_0597" class="ref lb">597</a>] in the man.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh. refrains from bringing Nell onto the stage in person. The

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>106</i>] Upon the close of this episode [<a href="#tln_1599" class="ref lb">1599–1760</a>] Aegeon is allowed the
              centre of the stage for fifty lines. The pathos of his appeal to him whom he takes to
              be my only son is very moving, but, of course, it is checked by his
              mistaking Antipholus of Ephesus for him of Syracuse. Thus Aegeon is drawn into the
              atmosphere of illusion; so is even the stiff-backed Duke a little later (line [<a href="#tln_1850" class="ref lb">1850</a>]). The tearful joys of the reunion of
              the old man’s family are finely interwoven with enchanting mistakes (lines [<a href="#tln_1816" class="ref lb">1816–1905</a>]), and
              parodied at the close by the conference of the two Dromios. When Dromio of Syracuse
              declares to his new-found brother (italics mine), There is a fat
                  <i>friend</i> at your master’s house <br/>That kitchened me for

                  wife . . . [<a href="#tln_1906" class="ref lb">1906–8</a>]  the speaker’s sense of relief is as vast as the girth of
              Nell. This speech brings us back towards everyday reality. Yet it reminds us, surely,
              of this Dromio’s dread of Nell as a diviner and a witch
                ([<a href="#tln_0929" class="ref lb">929</a>, <a href="#tln_0933" class="ref lb">933</a>]). Thus at the close there is a faint, last flicker of

              over the whole play without disturbing us much. Chance, which always plays some part
              in life, usurps the place of human planning, which we like to regard as the crucial
              factor. A chance meeting of mast and rock, and a chance disposition of fast and slow
              sails, separated the family. Chance . . . finally reunites everyone. None of the
              crucial events is effected by anyone’s conscious purpose, except the pardoning of
              Aegeon. . . . Aegeon is present not to evoke emotion but to serve the ends of comedy;
              he acts as expositor in the beginning, and his uncertain fate sustains curiosity when
              our interest might flag because the unraveling of a plot based on mistaken identity is
              so singularly predictable.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Two essays cover the themes in a compendious way. Studies that follow these two often
            elaborate what they sometimes merely mention.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_broh1961" class="ref bibl">Brooks</a> (1961,
            pp. 66–9): However they [the themes] are deepened and interconnected by
              Shakespeare’s treatment, they are not recondite: for the audience, they are the
              general ideas arising most naturally from the motives and development of the plot, and
              the response of the characters. The play begins and ends with relationship: a family
              torn asunder and reunited. Relationship is the motive that has brought Egeon, and the
              alien Antipholus and Dromio, to the hazards of Ephesus; relationship is threatened by
              the tensions in the marriage of Antipholus the denizen. The chief entanglements spring
              from mistaken identity and mistiming: I see we still did meet each
                other’s man, <br/>And I was ta’en for him, and he for me, <br/>And thereupon these
                  <i>errors</i> are arose. [<a href="#tln_1875" class="ref lb">1875–7</a>] The twins appear the same, but in
              reality are different; those who meet them are led by appearance into illusion.
              Repeatedly one of the persons assumes that he shared an experience with another, when
              in reality he shared it with a different one. In consequence, the persons cease to be
              able to follow each other’s assumptions, and become isolated in more or less private
              worlds. Mistakes of identity all but destroy relationship, and loss of relationship
              calls true identity yet more in question; the chief persons suspect themselves or are
              suspected of insanity, or of being possessed, surrounded, or assailed by supernatural
              powers—madness or demoniac possession would be the eclipse of the true self, and
              sorcery might overwhelm it. The alien Antipholus and Dromio fear Circean
              metamorphosis; Egeon, that he has been deformed out of recognition by time. Yet the
              hazard of metamorphosis and of the loss of present identity is also the way to fresh
              or restored relationship. Antipholus the bachelor desires that Luciana will transform
              him and create him new; and Adriana’s belief that in marriage the former identities
              coalesce and emerge identified with each other, is true if rightly interpreted. How
              the possessive interpretation, not relinquished by Adriana till almost the end, is at
              odds with the free giving and hazarding in which the wealth and debts of love differ
              from those of commerce, is another central theme, well traced by J. R. Brown.
              Adriana’s envy of a husband’s status contravenes principles of order that for
              Shakespeare and orthodox Elizabethans extended through the whole cosmos. The status of
              husband, and of wife, Kate’s lines in <i>The Shrew</i> imply, are
              related to their places in this hierarchical order: Such duty as
                the subject owes the prince <br/>Even such a woman oweth to her husband. [2713–14]</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>67</i>] Adriana comes to style her husband lord,
              and they each lay their case, as each has come to see it, before the Duke, reminding
              themselves and him that the match was first made by his authority. By this point,
              disorder from the various disruptions of relationship has gone so far in the
              community, that only the appeals for justice addressed to the Abbess and to him, God’s
              viceroys spiritual and temporal, are capable, the time now being ripe, of leading to a
              solution.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Not only are the themes organically developed in the action; they are
              organically connected in themselves. At the centre is relationship: relationship
              between human beings, depending on their right relationship to truth and universal
              law: to the cosmic reality behind appearance, and the cosmic order. Trust in mere
              appearance results in illusion and mistakes of identity, thus dislocating
              relationship, and so disrupting order: blind conflict and disorder are inevitable when
              men misconceive true identity and become isolated in private worlds. Besides illusion,
              there are other factors of disorder: revolt against a wife’s place in the cosmic
              hierarchy is the original source of discord in Adriana’s marriage: order is broken,
              too, by everything untimely. As Ovid’s <i>Tempus edax rerum</i>,
              time opposes mutability to the creative cosmic order. By that mutability, identity
              itself may be threatened: <i>Nec species sua
                  cuique manet</i> . . . —the link of time-theme and appearance-theme
              is present in Ovid, and particularly clear in the apostrophe to Time wrung from Egeon
              when he finds himself unrecognized. Here, and in the dread of Circean transformation
              into beasts, metamorphosis is seen in its hostile aspect; but, as we have observed, it
              can also transform for the better: time, too, when it is ripe, brings a new order.
              Till then, patience would mitigate disorder, which cannot be ended till the claims for
              justice, distorted by the claimants’ assumption that their private worlds are real,
              are laid before those who in the hierarchy of order are founts of justice upon earth.
              More than justice is needed: without mercy, the godly prince is not himself; and amid
              the demonstrations of love’s wealth, lacking which there would be little of the genial
              warmth that glows in the conclusion, Solinus is inspired to what he had declared
              impossible, and freely remits the debt Egeon owes the law. In this organic structure,
              of the two themes which next to relationship are the most inclusive, the first, cosmic
              order, presides in Shakespeare’s early Histories; its importance in his drama is well
              recognized, and the importance of the second, appearance and reality, is becoming so.
              The first is a familiar part of the Elizabethan world-picture; the
              second, presumably, has affiliations with Renaissance neo-Platonism.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>68</i>] The themes are given prominence in several
              ways. They are voiced by the speakers, who often relate one theme to another: the
              examples in our analysis of I. ii are characteristic. The dominant imagery, of man as
              beast, reflects the ideas of illusory appearance and malign metamorphosis; above all,
              it mirrors the threats to identity and to status in the cosmic order. Appropriately,
              it stops on the brink of the <i>dénouement</i>
              with the Duke’s explicit formulation: I think you all have drunk
                of Circe’s cup. [<a href="#tln_1747" class="ref lb">1747</a>]</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Thematic, likewise, are the two images of the water-drop, its identity
              lost for relationship’s sake. The whole harmonic structure, of which the
              correspondence of images forms part, is a vehicle of the themes. How generosity and
              two degrees of possessiveness in love are defined by juxtaposition of <i>scènes</i> in III. ii, with reference back to
              Adriana’s attitude in Act II, has been shown by J. R. Brown. The supreme instance is
              the parallel between the gossips’ feast to which everyone is going at
              the end, and the dinner from which the husband and his guests were shut out. The
              gossips’ or baptismal feast affirms relationship and identity: the kin are united, the
              Duke is patron, all are friends and godparents; witnesses to the identities now truly
              established and christened into the family and the community; long travail is
              rewarded, and increase (the progressive aspect of cosmic order) which, despite the
              double birth of twins, was mocked by the intervention of mutable fortune, is now truly
              realized. It is not only as a sensational error of identity that the exclusion from
              dinner contrasts with this: balked or broken feasts (G. Wilson Knight has made us
              aware) are recurrent symbols in Shakespeare of the breakdown of human fellowship and
              its pieties. Both this motif, and the extravagant comedy of the barring-out, are
              worked up by the burlesque Lylyan or Erasmian colloquy on whether good cheer or
              welcome makes the feast. The burlesque turns for the clowns belong to
              the harmonic structure in much the same way.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed.
            1962, pp. xliv ff.): The serious force of the presentation of the Antipholus
              twins is paralleled by a more comic treatment of their servants. Each is puzzled at
              being mistaken for the other, and each comes to feel that he is being transformed—but
              into an ass, rather than another person. So Dromio of Ephesus suffers like an ass from
              the blows of his master ([<a href="#tln_0637" class="ref lb">637</a>]), and,
              finding that another has assumed his office and identity as a servant in Adriana’s
              household, and that for his service he is rewarded with still more blows as his master
              grows angrier, he resigns himself to his topsy-turvy world with a humorous acceptance
              of it: [quotes <a href="#tln_1308" class="ref lb">1308–13</a>]. S. Dromio likewise speaks of transformation: (p. xlv)
              [Quotes <a href="#tln_0590" class="ref lb">590–7</a>]. . . . Each Dromio applies the term ass in relation to
              the beatings he is made to suffer . . . but the idea of being made a beast operates
              more generally in the play, reflecting the process of passion overcoming reason, as an
              animal rage, fear, or spite seizes on each of the main characters.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            For the sense of loss or change of identity in these figures goes
              together with a disruption of family, personal, and social relationships. Antipholus
              of Syracuse loses himself in the search for his mother and brother, but is hailed by
              all in Ephesus as if they knew him well; even as he thinks that he is subject to
                imaginary wiles ([<a href="#tln_1193" class="ref lb">1193</a>]),
              he is, unwittingly, causing a rift in the marriage of Adriana and his brother, and
              stirring discord between Antipholus of Ephesus and, on the one hand Angelo . . . , on
              the other hand the Courtesan, over the matter of the chain. In the confusion which
              follows upon his dining with Adriana, the new self he had found in his passion for
              Luciana is frustrated; confirmed in his belief that he wanders in illusions ([<a href="#tln_1225" class="ref lb">1225</a>]), he comes on at the end of Act IV,
              sword in hand, to drive her and Adriana off as witches. At the same
              time, Antipholus of Ephesus, denied entry to his own house, comes to believe that he
              is the victim of a plot, and that his wife is a strumpet ([<a href="#tln_1416" class="ref lb">1416</a>]). . . . The normal intercourse of the
              city in its friendly, commercial relationships is also disturbed, to the extent that
              the Second Merchant, believing himself wronged, [<i>xlvi</i>] puts
              both Angelo and Antipholus under arrest, and the long-standing trust between these two
              is destroyed. The confusions of identity, involving for Antipholus of Syracuse and the
              two Dromios a sense especially of loss or transformation, and for Antipholus of
              Syracuse a need defiantly to assert his identity in a world that seems to go mad, thus
              lead to a breakdown of the social order through the frustration of personal
              relationships. Quarrels and arrests follow. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The growth of this disorder is reflected in two other strands in
              language and action which reinforce the serious undertones of the comedy. One is the
              establishment of Ephesus as a place associated with witchcraft. Antipholus of Syracuse
              arrives there with a prejudice about the city: [quotes <a href="#tln_0263" class="ref lb">263–8</a>]. Foakes lists the
            witchcraft passages, <a href="#tln_0832" class="ref lb">832</a>, <a href="#tln_0834" class="ref lb">834</a>; <a href="#tln_0946" class="ref lb">946</a>; <a href="#tln_1249" class="ref lb">1249</a>, <a href="#tln_1250" class="ref lb">1250</a>. The prejudice which he has on reaching Ephesus provides a
              ready explanation for all the strange things that happen to him, and becomes a settled
              conviction; he is more and more dis­[<i>xlvii</i>]abled from
              distinguishing between what is real and what is not, until the whole city seems to him
              to be in the grip of an evil power: [quotes <a href="#tln_1224" class="ref lb">1224–6</a>].</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Antipholus of Ephesus, by contrast, regards himself as alone sane in a
              world gone mad. He is given some force of character, and a tendency to violence, so
              that when he is shut out of his own house, he is driven to bewilderment and to
              passionate exclamation; though calmed for a moment by Balthasar, he thinks of
              punishing his wife by going at once to the Courtesan’s, and by bestowing a
                rope’s end ([<a href="#tln_0998" class="ref lb">998</a>]), i.e.
              a whipping, upon Adriana and her confederates. He invents an
              explanation of her treatment of him with this word; he decides he is the victim of a
              conspiracy confirmed by the incidents that befall him thereafter.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The confusions of identity and consequent disruptions of normal relationships
              force the characters to judge events according to their own private ordering of
              experience, as Adriana, too, is ready, at the suggestion of the Courtesan, to think
              her husband mad, and treat him as a dangerous lunatic. Out of the clashes of these
              private worlds of experience emerges another strand in language and action which is of
              some importance, a sense of evil at work in Ephesus. Dromio of Syracuse jests about
              the Officer who arrests Antipholus of Ephesus, calling him a devil, One that,
                before the judgment, carries poor souls to hell ([<a href="#tln_1149" class="ref lb">1149</a>]); he is quibbling on the last judgment, and on a
              common term for prison, but his jest, as is characteristic of the word-play of the
              Dromios, quickly becomes earnest when he meets his own master in the next scene [fn.
              comparing jokes on mistiming—<a href="#tln_0205" class="ref lb">205</a> ff., <a href="#tln_0450" class="ref lb">450</a> ff.—which turn out to have a
                bearing on the disorder later in the play—<a href="#tln_0450" class="ref lb">450–503</a> and <a href="#tln_1025" class="ref lb">1025–67</a>—and the way in which
                Dromio of Syracuse both parodies and reinforces his master’s prejudices in his
                account of the kitchen-wench, Nell—<a href="#tln_0933" class="ref lb">933</a>]. For Antipholus of Syracuse really thinks of the Courtesan as a
                fiend, and uses to her Christ’s words, Satan, [<i>xlviii</i>] avoid, spoken in rejection of the devil’s
              temptation in the wilderness; and if the Officer was a devil in an everlasting
                garment to Dromio, the Courtesan now becomes the devil’s dam.
              A little later, Adriana puts her husband, as a man possessed by the
                fiend, into the hands of an exorcist, who chants, [quotes <a href="#tln_1338" class="ref lb">1338–9</a>]. These hints of
              the devil at work mark a stage in the play when the appearance of normal order breaks
              down, and the action erupts into violence, as one Antipholus is bound, and the other
              rushes in to attack a group he believes are witches—a group that
              includes the Officer of the law.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In Act 5, Egeon, bound, comes on with the Duke, the representative of justice, who is
            appealed to by Adriana and then E. Antipholus for justice. Each clamours for an
              idea of justice based on a private ordering of experience, and the conflicting
              evidence of witnesses and supporters sets a problem too difficult for the law to
              solve; the Duke cries, [quotes <a href="#tln_1747" class="ref lb">1747–8</a>]. His words nicely suggest the kind and degree of
              transformation that has taken place in the citizens of Ephesus; they are behaving
              madly, and there is no order or coherence in what they allege against one
              another.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">To make matters worse, Egeon seizes the opportunity to appeal [<i>xlix</i>] for help to the son he sees before him, but Antipholus of Ephesus does
              not know him. The law cannot deal with this situation, and it is time for the Abbess
              to reappear, with the second Antipholus. The mistakes are explained. It
              is as if, through her intervention, the harsh justice embodied in the Duke is tempered
              by a Christian grace and mercy. . . . Here the characters recover or discover their
              real identity, order is restored, and the two pairs of twins follow the others off
              stage. . . . Violence is replaced by mildness and love, and the sense of witchcraft,
              evil, and Circean transformation is dispelled.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He quotes Wylie Sypher, <i>Comedy</i> (1956, p. 22) and Northrop
            Frye,  “The Argument of Comedy,” 
            <i>English Institute Essays</i> (1948, p. 61) on how comedy is a
            triumph over mortality and the means by which an individual is freed from unwanted
            social bonds, saying that these formulations, while too grand for <i>Err.</i> in total, have some relevance. (P. <i>xlix</i>): The terms of the first description are too large . . . , but clearly they
              have some relevance; there is the hint of a sacrifice in Egeon, the hero-victim
              brought to the point of death, and the comic action leads in its vitality to a kind of
              resurrection, a rebirth, the baptismal feast at the end. The second description [<i>l</i>] too applies in some degree; in this view, the moral
                norm is not morality, but deliverance, so that comedy is seen to be both
              radical and conservative. It may make the outsider, the man who does not fit into our
              society or its conventions, into a victim, exposing him or driving him out, like Dr.
              Pinch; and it may also expose the hollowness of a society’s pretensions by setting
              them against the exuberance of a figure like Dromio of Syracuse. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            These general considerations may help to illustrate the particular
              quality of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. The play has farcical
              comedy, and it has fantasy, but it does more than merely provoke laughter, or release
              us temporarily from inhibitions and custom into a world as free as a child’s,
              affording delight and freshening us up. It also invites compassion, a measure of
              sympathy, and a deeper response to the disruption of social and family relationships
              which the action brings about. Our concern for the Antipholus twins, for Adriana and
              Luciana, and our sense of disorder are deepened in the context of suffering provided
              by the enveloping action. The comedy proves, after all, to be more than a temporary
              and hilarious abrogation of normality; it is, at the same time, a process in which the
              main characters are in some sense purged, before harmony and the responsibility of
              normal relationships are restored at the end. Adriana learns to overcome her jealousy,
              and accepts the reproof of the Abbess; her husband is punished for his anger and
              potential brutality by Doctor Pinch’s drastic treatment; and Antipholus of Syracuse is
              cured of his prejudices about Ephesus. Behind them stands Egeon, a prototype of the
              noble sufferer or victim in later plays [Antonio in <i>MV</i>,
              Pericles].

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Loss of identity, a particularly 20th-c. anxiety, becomes an increasingly fertile
            topic; its psychoanalytic approaches are dealt with separately below, but the separation
            is difficult to keep clean.</p>

            (1939–40, p. 95): I think the underlying reason for [the play’s] success is the
              fact that Shakespeare was thoroughly penetrated by the comic horror, so to call it,
              implicit in the subject. Real horror attaches to the notion of the <i>complete</i> identity of two human beings; as in Poe’s ghastly tale of a girl who
              turned out to be the re-embodiment of the mother who died in giving birth to her; and
              as in certain ancient legends of various lands, notably China. All normal persons (and
              especially Shakespeare) set so much store by human individuality that they shrink from
              the thought of its being submerged. And since the amusing, when intense, is nigh to
              the serious, there is something shuddery in the close resemblance of persons just when
              this appears to us intensely entertaining. I recall a school-teacher many years ago
              who found in her class at the beginning of the term two little girls who were
              remarkably, even weirdly, identical twins. . . . At the end of the
              first week the teacher exclaimed to us all with comic horror: These two are the
                same—how can I tell them apart? After a moment of dead silence a small boy
              (not I) piped out, Mary’s temper’s better’n Martha’s. The general
              laughter which ensued had in it a note of relief that was not exclusively comic. And
                <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> has a note of real weirdness just when
              its mirth is keenest.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_broh1961" class="ref bibl">Brooks</a> (1961,
            pp. 58–60): The idea of his [S.Antipholus’s] losing himself [<a href="#tln_0204" class="ref lb">204</a>] is taken up in a profound sense, and
              couched in a fine image commensurate with its thematic importance. The theme of
              identity is here linked with those of relationship (dislocated or re-established), and
              of risk. To seek reunion with the lost members of the family, Antipholus is risking
              his identity; yet he must do so, for only if the full relationship is restored can he
              find content. And then, hints the image of one water-drop seeking another, the present
              individual identity will be lost, or transformed, in another way. It is to claim a
              sinking of identity in the marriage-relation, with the emergence of a new identity,
              where each is also the other, that Adriana uses the closely similar image in II.ii. In
              the play’s harmonic structure, while this soliloquy is thus recalled at that point, in
              its own place it recalls the situation of Egeon, who on virtually the same quest as
              Antipholus, has so risked his mortal identity that it is forfeit to the [<i>59</i>] executioner. Antipholus’ fear that he is losing himself is
              full of comic irony. No sooner has he expressed it, than, with the entry of his
              brother’s Dromio, he begins to be the victim of the successive mistakes of identity to
              which his words are designed by Shakespeare as a prelude, and in the course of which
              he will come to wonder whether he is beside himself, and has lost himself
              indeed. Brooks lists the mistakes based on confused identity, then It
              is by mistaking appearance for reality that Antipholus and his brother’s Dromio
              misidentify one another. The threat to the very self involved in the confusion of
              appearance and reality is the thought most [<i>60</i>] vividly
              conveyed in Antipholus’ second soliloquy [<a href="#tln_0261" class="ref lb">261–71</a>]. . . . The lines [<a href="#tln_0265" class="ref lb">265–6</a>] seize the imagination of the
              audience at the deep level where the ancient dread of losing the self or soul is very
              much alive. They are highly characteristic of the imaginative Antipholus, develop the
              idea in his first soliloquy that his self is at hazard, and set the pattern for his
              interpretations of the strange experiences that befall him henceforward.</p>

              the individual ego. One is seldom pleased to find that he is constantly being taken
              for someone else—usually, of course, someone much less impressive. There are, however,
              several kinds of mistaken identity. This play employs the lowest. The two higher
              forms . . . are mistaking the true nature of another person and mistaking one’s own
              nature. Both lead to a re-examination of life and involve character growth. Exteriors
              are important only in so far as they lead to a realization of one’s true nature. Of
              these two higher forms there are only hints in <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i>. Antipholus of Syracuse asks a question that might have been
              all-important in a later comedy: [quotes <a href="#tln_0608" class="ref lb">608–10</a>]. [<i>23</i>] This is a remote
              approach to the agonizing and central question which Angelo in <i>Measure for Measure</i> asks himself: What dost thou? or what art thou,
                Angelo? [<a href="#tln_0936" class="ref lb">936</a>]—a question
              preparing him for a totally new understanding of his own nature. On a still higher
              level—and showing that mistaken identity is fundamental to Shakespearean tragedy as
              well—is Lear’s question: Who is it that can tell me who I am? [<a href="#tln_0743" class="ref lb">743</a>].</p>

            There is no probing of personality in <i>The Comedy of

              errors. Confusion leads to near-madness but does not bring about the breakdown of an
              ego prior to self-knowledge; it leads rather to drawn swords and head-blows. The
              resolution of the play is not the serene elevation of vision which we find in the
              later comedies; it is simply a recognition of who, physically, is who.

              others? How far do we need others in order to have an identity at all? Is one’s
              identity entirely dependent on the personal and social links and bonds, the ties of
              family, love, friendship and civic duty? In order that these questions might be

              individuality? Is it not in my consciousness of inhabiting an ordered temporal
              dimension, in which, by exercising the functions of retrospect, observation and
              anticipation, I infer from the steady flow of future through present into past, the
              existence of the entity through which this flow passes? . . . Part of the uneasiness
              which underlies our laughter in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is
              related to the tricks it plays, in form, language and action, with what we take to be
              a normal temporal sequence.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The duplication of identity in relation to time has two aspects relevant
              to the play. In a general sense, and from the standpoint of the audience, it is a way
              of distorting and distending time. As such it is for us a fulfilment of one of the
              functions of comedy, to transcend in some [<i>82</i>] fashion the
              devouring power of human time, whose movement is always towards decay and
              death. . . .

            For the experiencing agents . . . duplication of identity which they
              themselves are unaware of is felt as a dislocation of the ordinary world and of the
              steady single direction of time as the medium of experience. . . . If either of these
              were disrupted, our sense of time would be deranged, as happens in a very mild way
              whenever we watch a film sequence run backwards. . . . A good deal of the
              action . . . can be fairly described as disruption of the sequence of causality and
              of the process of storing up information, from the point of view of those involved in
              it. I send a man off to find out what time the ship sails, and he brings me back a bag
              of gold. I ask him whether he has put my money away safely and he tells me the dinner
              is burning. . . . No information, however recently acquired, can be trusted.

            p. 31): The concept of the absolute external identity of one person with another
              is easily productive of comedy; but it is also frightening. It is a concept that
              Shakespeare, as the father of twins, had special reason to ponder.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_vant1978" class="ref bibl">Van Laan</a> (1978,
            pp. 21–6, 43–4, 179–80) devotes a chapter,  “Identity and Role,” 
            using <i>Err.</i> to show what it reveals about Shakespeare’s
              sense of dramatic character and of the relation between a character’s identity and
              role-playing. Identity is of course an important dramatic issue throughout
              Shakespeare, yet it is nowhere more explicitly so than in this play. Oddly enough, the
              play offers not one but two definitions of identity, the first perceivable through
              focusing upon action, the second through focusing on character.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(1) Action. The most recurrent . . . action . . . is the attribution of
              identity to someone who does not correspond to it. Early on the misattributed identity
              is simply that of a second character with whom the first has been confused, but before
              long the process grows more complicated, and thus throughout most of the play the
              falsely attributed identity is a fiction even within the world of the play, a new
              creation, a bizarre composite of the actual identity of one character, cer­[<i>22</i>]tain statements and actions of another, and the wild
              imaginings of a third. Whatever the combination of this basic pattern may be,
              the spectators are continually presented with a discrepancy between
              the projected identity and the character to whom it is attributed.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">What complicates this basic pattern is that, although the discrepancy
              is always obvious to the spectators and usually apparent to the mistaken character, it
              often carries no real weight in the action. Time and time again, it is the attributed
              rather than the actual identity that determines the experience of the character,
              whether he notes the discrepancy or not. When S. Antipholus beats E. Dromio in
            2.1, the mistake is irrelevant as far as poor Dromio is concerned: the beating
              has been administered; in existence if not in essence, Dromio of Ephesus has become
              his Syracusan twin. Another example: E. Antipholus knows he is not the
            imposter in 3.1, but remains locked out. This complication, in which the mistaken
              character is made to undergo experiences appropriate to the identity imposed on him,
              combines well with the fictitiousness of most of the imposed identities. Identity
                <i>per se</i> begins to look like a kind of
              role that one might play as if one were an actor portraying the part of some fictional
              character.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(2) Identity as a role, e.g., Dromio in 3.1 playing at being the porter at the gate
              (<a href="#tln_0607" class="ref lb">607</a>, <a href="#tln_0613" class="ref lb">613</a>) where Master, shall I be porter at the
              gate? (<a href="#tln_0613" class="ref lb">613</a>) (p. 23) suggests that in this world there is no real difference between being
              something and playing something. . . . [S.] Antipholus . . . responds in a similar
              fashion. He is bewildered by the presumptuous behaviour of these strange women and
              especially by their commands to himself and Dromio, but he decides to say as
                they say, and persever so ([<a href="#tln_0611" class="ref lb">611</a>]). He too, therefore, agrees to play a role, to take direction from others
              and speak the lines they expect from him; and, like Dromio, he is successful in
              playing his assigned part. He refuses to treat Adriana as a wife, for he instead
              vigorously woos Luciana, but this behaviour, rather than exposing the imposture, is
              interpreted by Adriana as merely the latest and the most outrageous example of her
              husband’s philandering.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Oddly enough, the characters’ attitudes towards their own identities
              further help to establish this notion of identity as role. When Dromio of Syracuse
              finds an alien identity imposed on him by Adriana and Luciana, he does not, even when
              he gets the chance, insist on the authenticity of his own; instead, he fears he has
              been transformed ([<a href="#tln_0590" class="ref lb">590</a>]). Antipholus thinks he has been transformed. He (p. 24)
              sees his identity, that which should be his most intrinsic possession, as
              perhaps no more an essential part of himself than a dramatic role is of an actor who
              performs it, commenting on <a href="#tln_0824" class="ref lb">824–9</a>.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 25): It is . . . in the final scene . . . that Shakespeare most
              clearly establishes the overwhelming importance of external relationships in the
              composition of identity. Here all the characters are properly identified, but only in
              terms of their links with one another, that is, as husbands, wives, fathers, sons,
              mothers, masters, servants, and—most important of all—brothers. The celebration called
              for by Aemilia is properly a nativity feast because the central characters are truly
              reborn. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>26</i>] For Pinch and the Duke, identity is
              equivalent to a single role. For most of the others, however, it is a more complicated
              matter because in each case several roles are involved. Yet not even for these others
              is identity some kind of unified personality (character in the
              psychological sense) but rather the nexus of various social roles that they are given
              to play.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Any attempt to penetrate beneath this nexus in search of the
                essential man is doomed to failure. Antipholus of Syracuse mentions
              at one point his soul’s pure truth ([<a href="#tln_0824" class="ref lb">824</a>]), but it is an empty, undramatized cliché without any
              validity. Antipholus has no inner substance; apart from his ability to perform
              properly whichever of his roles the immediate situation seems to call for, or his
              capacity to express bewilderment in response to bewildering events, he is devoid of
                personality. The reason is obvious. Antipholus of Syracuse must lack
              inner substance because the play requires that he be interchangeable with his Ephesian
              twin.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Role-playing is not thematic in <i>Err</i>, but becomes so from
              <i>Shr.</i> on (positing that <i>Err.</i> is first
            in the comic, if not the entire, canon). (P. 43): One reason for the lack of
              explicitness in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is that its role-playing
              is primarily an unconscious activity. The characters cannot actually perceive the
              ubiquity of role-playing in themselves . . . because they engage in it only as a
              function of their familial and social ties or as a result of others having imposed
              alien identities on them. None of them indulges in a deliberate attempt to pass
              himself off as something [<i>44</i>] he is not.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The meaning of the loss of identity, how characters respond to the threat, is the stuff
            of the great tragedies. The loss is managed by having a familiar external reality change
            under one’s feet. (P. 179): This linking of identity loss with the sense of
              dislocated reality and madness indicates that Shakespeare already [in <i>Err.</i>] conceives of the nexus of roles which form a character’s identity as
              the source of his bearings, the means by which he locates himself within and orders
              himself in relation to the wilderness of the universe. Characters must
              respond to the loss or threatened loss [of identity] in some decisive and appropriate
              way—again judging from both <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> and the
              great tragedies, by going mad, resort­[<i>180</i>]ing to violence,
              finding new roles to play, or, perhaps, by some combination of all these
              expediencies.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_frem1981" class="ref bibl">French</a> (1981,
            p. 81): At this point in his life [the very beginning of his writing career],
              Shakespeare believed that one’s identity is largely a matter of one’s place in the
              world. This is in contrast to his later belief, given utterance in <i>King Lear</i>, that one’s identity is defined by one’s place on earth, which is
              mere lonely vulnerable mortality. . . . [<i>Err.</i>] insists that
              no matter how we protest, we are what we are socially perceived to be, that outer
              structures determine inner ones, to a greater degree than people raised to worship
              individuality and transcendence may be willing to admit.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_scom1982" class="ref bibl">Scott</a> (1982,
            pp. 2–4): Egeon in the first scene is a pathetic old man, isolated in an alien
              land divorced from wife and children through the dictates of wealth and Fortune:
              [quotes <a href="#tln_0040" class="ref lb">40–7</a>]. [<i>3</i>] This incident was eventually to isolate Egeon from his wife
              and children so that now in Ephesus he has no will to live, his only wish being to
              know whether his family are still alive: [quotes <a href="#tln_0140" class="ref lb">140–2</a>, <a href="#tln_0160" class="ref lb">160–1</a>]. The procrastination of his death
              implies that Egeon has spent the last five years, at least, of his life in the despair
              of isolation, searching for his family, his roots which are his identity. It is this
              loss of self-identity not only for Egeon, but for all his relations which is to form
              the kernel of the play; a simple idea at first only proposed by the old man’s pathetic
              tale but soon stated explicitly as a theme, by Antipholus of Syracuse: [quotes <a href="#tln_0199" class="ref lb">199–204</a>]. It is
              misleading to see this statement as an insight to Antipholus’s characterization. We
              are not watching a comedy dealing in such terms but rather a farce which negates
              characterization in favour of simple archetype. Antipholus’s speech therefore
              naturally becomes a clarification of Egeon’s opening [<i>4</i>]
              statement. . . . Thus Egeon’s exposition is simply clarified by Antipholus before we
              are presented with the complexities of the variations, which in this case we call the
                errors on the theme of the loss of identity. We soon find therefore
              that the three principal characters, Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus,
              and Adriana are comically portrayed as separated from any relationship with another
              person. All are searching, striving, enquiring and yet getting nowhere since there
              seem to be no answers. Such depiction of separation and utter
              loneliness has found expression in the farcical theatre of the absurd.</p>

              priority of corporate identities over the single and limited life of the individual
              consciousness. Sh. found this emphasis in Saint Paul’s imagery of Christians
            being members of Christ’s body in Eph.</p>

              the key to deciphering them, lies in their language; only that finally marks them
              apart. If the Antipholi had lost the power of speech . . . then they would have been,
              for all intents, completely identical. Here is an anomalous case where the retention
              of speech becomes ironic cause for further transformation. And yet names, and all
              language, have been revealed as generically susceptible to metamorphosis. To say
                I, sir, am Dromio [<a href="#tln_1821" class="ref lb">1821</a>],
              is to announce and to undermine one’s identity at the same time, because our names
              uniquely mark us and yet do not mark us. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>79</i>] The Dromii end the play by going off
                hand in hand, not one before the other, E. Dromio explaining that
                We came into the world like brother and brother ([<a href="#tln_1917" class="ref lb">1917</a>]). But of course they came into the world not side by
              side, but one after the other, not only the same but also different. Chronology
              therefore becomes an issue: [quotes <a href="#tln_1911" class="ref lb">1911–15</a>]. E. Dromio then rejects this motion of
              difference, bidding them instead to go out together. It seems a quixotic effort. A
              great deal of the play has gone to show that even minimal difference and boundary
              become crucial to human identity. At the moment of metamorphosis, when S. Dromio
              becomes E. Dromio or vice versa, one or both will temporarily cease to exist.
              Shakespeare has put such a case quite flamboyantly here, with two sets of twins. And
              though the re-naming of the christening feast will go far toward sorting out the
                sympathized one day’s error [<a href="#tln_1887" class="ref lb">1887</a>], we will still recall that the sheerest linguistic thread maintained
              the margin of difference. Two almost became one, or one none.</p>

            makes the city a participant in the comedy (p. 178): The city
              experiences a crisis of its own being which grows out of and is parallel to the
              experience of its characters. The comic crisis that the characters must resolve
              interlocks with the crisis of an entire social order. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>186</i>] Only by attending to the nature of the
              urban environment in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> can the play’s deep
              concern with the ambiguities of personal and civic identity become fully
              realized. . . . Thus, in seeing two Egeons [one with a deeply sad personal story, the
              other a political enemy from Syracuse] where [<i>187</i>] only one
              exists, Ephesus betrays its profound dualism, a communal dualism given literal,
              individual embodiment when the wandering twins step onstage.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The wandering Antipholus’s first moments onstage also suggest the
              potential doubleness of Ephesus, for even as he is told of its dangerousness for him,
              he accepts a bag of gold [it is, after all, his—see <a href="#tln_0170" class="ref lb">170</a>]—the gesture emblematic of the commercial exchanges at
              the heart of urban life. More importantly, by characterizing Ephesus as alternately
              welcoming and hostile, as home and alien city, Shakespeare associates the city with
              the closely related archetypal motifs of the pursuing double and of fraternal
              rivalry. . . . The relevance of such archetypes [e.g., Otto Rank, <i>The Double</i>]—particularly the fraternal rivalry that we have already come to
              connect with the idea of the city—allows us to see how Shakespeare uses the farcical
              action of the doubled twins not only as a paradigm of personal self-fulfillment in
              family reunion, but also as a paradigm of the radical connectedness of social
              experience, an ideal relation of self and city which gets tested in the two later
              plays [i.e., <i>MV</i>, <i>MM</i>]. Hence,
            nearly every incident includes the city as player.</p>

              the way Antipholus structures his complaint, framing his trepidation over magicians
                that change the mind and deform the body between the
              first two and the last lines of the passage, where he expresses his fear of monetary

            context is of Renaissance self-fashioning, in which hierarchical discipline is
            maintained by public marks of character such as were governed by sumptuary laws. As this
            discipline eroded—upstarts might adopt the outward marks of their superiors—protectors
            of authority and privilege began to emphasize, in addition to outward display, (p. 88)
              interiorization of nobility and value. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>90</i>] <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i> . . . takes as its focus the discontinuities between identities and
              the external marks that display, support, and confirm them. . . . That is, <i>Errors</i> stresses the marks and rituals—faces, clothing, beatings,
              warts and moles, meals, rings and gold chains—that make characters recognizable, and
              it demonstrates . . . how reliance upon this material evidence leads to unpredictable
              identity-effects. . . . Near its center is an emblem of the play’s thoroughgoing
              focus on corporeality: the grotesquely fat kitchen wench Nell, whose sweating, greasy,
              swarthy body parts Dromio of Syracuse lavishly details. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>91</i>] The two Antipholi and Dromios pose a kind
              of limit case: how might identity be disrupted when the public marks of that identity
              are not merely counterfeited but <i>exactly duplicated and possessed by
                someone else?</i> . . . Once Antipholus and Dromio’s faces can point to identities
              not their own, the play breaks the seemingly necessary correspondence between outer
              and inner character; a certain self may not necessarily take a certain shape and form.
              For a culture that places such weight on stable characterological display, the danger
              to selfhood registers in a threat both spiritual and physical.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Why do the characters not guess that the confusions are caused by the presence of
            twins? Their blindness . . . [<i>92</i>] makes palpable an
              ideological blind spot <i>within a particular kind of logic</i> that
              governs the construction of Elizabethan identity: these characters don’t come up with
              the solution twins because, as Emilia notes, they all make the same
                sympathised one day’s error ([<a href="#tln_1887" class="ref lb">1887</a>]). They assume that distinct identities are manifest in distinct marks.
              Crucial to this local logic is the role of the viewer, who recognizes
              those marks and upon whose recognition the character’s sense of identity depends.
              Shakespeare signals the importance of this confirming gaze as early as Egeon’s tragic
              tale of the shipwreck . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_0081" class="ref lb">81–8</a>].</p>

              takes the form of mistaken exchanges, as Antipholus of Syracuse remarks: [quotes <a href="#tln_1184" class="ref lb">1184–94</a>]. [<i>177</i>] The passage equates being acknowledged as oneself—being
              called by one’s name, or hailed in a social gesture, the salute—with participating in
              exchanges of various sorts: buying and selling, giving and receiving money,
              prof[f]ering and accepting invitations or expressions of gratitude for
                kindnesses previously rendered. Even the validation of physical
              existence—the measure of my body [<a href="#tln_1192" class="ref lb">1192</a>]—is part of an ongoing transaction. . . . Only sorcery intruding from
              the outer (or upper) reaches . . . can account for the perplexing social exchanges
              our twin experiences. Antipholus of Syracuse and the dramatic structure of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> demand that we understand commerce as a means
              of both constructing and expressing—enacting and symbolizing—identity.</p>

              most impressive form by a servant, whom, according to comic convention, we cannot take
              altogether seriously. We never cease to laugh even when we feel his plight;

              uncharacteristically reflective moment, Antipholus of Syracuse declares: [quotes <a href="#tln_0199" class="ref lb">199–200</a>].</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Associated with anxiety about the loss of identity is the fear of transformation. <a href="#b_babw1972" class="ref bibl">Babula</a> (1972, pp.
            26, 33): A single element that ties all of these characters is their fear of
              destructive change. He lists them, nearly all having to do with the fear of
            metamorphosis.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 33): Shakespeare has unified his play through a combination of
              change-threatening experiences at every level and the highly imaginative responses to
              those simultaneously real and illusory threats made by Aegeon and alien Antipholus on
              the highest perceptive plane. For both have felt, as the comedy made them feel, that
              to move through life is to grope through a misty dream. The Ephesians, he
            says, have rational explanations for what befalls them.</p>

              ability to shift symbolic significance. The licentious ass, the
                foolish ass, and the admirable ass inhabit one
              hide. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>443</i>] In <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i>, the ass motif has performed a variety of services. By its sheer
              iteration, it unifies the play; by its primary appeal to laughter, it helps establish
              the comic perspective at crucial points in the action; by its varying connotations, it
              aids in character delineation; by its metaphorical operation, it acts as a paradigm of
              the metamorphosis. In a broad sense, all characters are asses; in their unrelenting
              unawareness of each other’s presence in Ephesus, they form an iconographic parade of
              ignorance assembled from the pages of Ripa and Valeriano. Ultimately, however, the
              same complex of associations that informs the <i>asinus portans mysteria</i> emblem is at work in <i>The Comedy
                of Errors</i>. The ass may be foolish and licentious, his mis-takings making him
              a target of laughter, but he has been chosen to carry the reconciling promise of
              wisdom.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_carw1985" class="ref bibl">Carroll</a> (1985,
            pp. 65, 67, 72–3): The rhetoric and terminology of metamorphosis are
              everywhere overt in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, but the physical
              process itself has been carefully sidestepped: the dramatist employs instead doubling
              and an ingenious manipulation of what might be termed situational point
              of view to achieve the same effects. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>67</i>] Applying the language of physical change to
              interior changes becomes a <i>modus
                operandi</i> in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. Shakespeare
              incarnates metamorphosis within his characters in such a way that both its mysterious
              powers and skepticism about its existence are felt simultaneously. . . . [S.
              Antipholus] is . . . the stranger in a strange land. He notes the water-drop
            speech, 199–202, and its raising the question of identity. Metamorphosis
              is the quintessential loss of self, and doubling . . . offers an ironic and
              unsatisfying way of finding that lost self. The physical reunion of the separated
              twins will thus constitute only one part of a complex re-forming of the
            self.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The kind of experience Antipholus of Syracuse undergoes serves as a
              model of transformation by doubling. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>72</i>] The Plautine convention rarely leads as
              deeply as Shakespeare is about to take us. He seems . . . to have rejected the basic
              assumption that identical twins are identical. For [<i>73</i>]
              dramatic purposes, the most important fact about identical twins is that they are and
              must be finally different. If they were <i>completely</i> identical,
              there would be no play. Their overwhelming similarity allows the playwright to
              construct a complex transformational situation, but only their difference allows it to
              come to dramatic life. . . . Metamorphosis appears as both change <i>and</i> stasis, then; it manifests itself simultaneously as being (remaining the
              same) and not-being (the metamorphosed other). . . . Like any metamorphosis, which is
              and is not, absolute identity is only asymptotically approached, and difference, the
                is not, is preserved.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Others who treat transformation are <a href="#b_lega1974" class="ref bibl">Leggatt</a> (1974, p. 11): S. Antipholus transformed by love,
            and <a href="#b_scow1977" class="ref bibl">Scott</a> (1977,
            p. 115): The power of love to transform a person is the basis of an impressive
              moment in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> when Antipholus of Syracuse
              met Luciana.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The rise of interest in issues of the creation of identity and ensuing crises of
            identity in <i>Err.</i> has led to a branch of criticism markedly
            psychoanalytic in approach, sometimes more loosely psychological. One
            subbranch deals with the incest involved had S. Antipholus had sex with his brother’s
            wife, a taboo no longer much recognized; at the end of this section I note its biblical
            history. That these are characters in a play who have no psyches to analyze does not
            bother the practitioners.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_fela1955" class="ref bibl">Feldman</a> (1955, p. 116): The dramatist’s compassion for the
              melancholy [E.] Antipholus bears witness for our conviction that Shakespeare
              identified himself with the outraged husband. He had broken away from his own wife and
              felt a strong impulse to justify the act on the stage. It could not be shown
              straightforwardly, of course. In the first place the poet was too blind with tears of
              self-pity to see the naked truth. Moreover he sensed that his wife did not hold a
              monopoly of the guilt in their disgrace. He had the intelligence and the courage to
              admit that he had contributed wrongs and miseries to the marriage; but his courage
              took the peculiar path of confessing his sins under the mask of comedy.
            Feldman sees the play as the product of Sh.’s guilty incestuous desires for his
            mother.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_grim1969" class="ref bibl">Grivelet</a> (1969,
            pp. 15 ff.), on Molière’s <i>Amphitryon</i> and <i>Err.</i>, sees <i>Err.</i> as based in the Oedipus complex; he
            is one of few commentators to dwell on the skirted incest in the play. The riddle of
            twins is widespread; the fact of two people indistinguishable by looks may cause
            anxiety, because of the ease with which the wrong twin might have sex with an unwitting
            wife, as Jupiter does with Alcmena in <i>Amphitruo</i> and as Adriana, dutiful wife though she is, narrowly escapes going to bed with the
              wrong Antipholus. And thus the case reveals itself as one . . . of potential
              incest. . . . It is easy enough to see moreover that in [<i>16</i>]
              the triangular relationship the real Amphitryon plays the part of a staid husband,
              already past his best, while all the illicit intoxication, the daring, the youth of
              love is on the side of Jupiter. Thus the suggestion of incest which attaches to the
              triangle points to its great archetype. As Charles Mauron says, the magic resemblance
              between two brothers modulates into the magic resemblance between father and son. You
              have . . . the inevitable Oedipus situation.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The subject . . . is then a highly serious subject, rooted in the
              deepest anxieties of the human mind. And yet, in spite of its seriousness—or perhaps
              because of it—it has long proved to be particularly fit for comic
              treatment. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>17</i>] [<i>Amphitryon</i> and
                <i>Err.</i>] are remarkable instances of the ambiguity of comedy.
              They turn the deepest causes of man’s bewilderment into a joke, but it is a perilous
              balance which keeps them on the side of laughter. This uncertainty has philosophical
              implications and, moreover, they deal so explicitly with its cause that it may not be
              entirely misleading to treat them as comedies of ambiguity. . . . By ambiguity I
              simply mean man’s doubtfulness about being one or two, identical with himself or
              not. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, the fun arises mostly
              from the fact that the pieces of the family puzzle, the elements of the solution, are
              all there, ready for use, in the same city of Ephesus. Only the most perverse of
              chances would bring about a fatal mistaking of identities. Our real fear is lest the
              two [sets of twins] should happen to meet and thus, by inevitable recognition, spoil
              the game. The greatest hilarity surrounds the excluding of E. Antipholus from
            his own house, bringing on the near-miss of incest between Adriana and her
            brother-in-law. (P. 18): Whether we fear more that this should happen
              than that it should not is a debatable question and, perhaps, a matter of taste. In
              any case, our comic pleasure owes much to the extreme precision and the extreme
              precariousness, to what we may call with Antipholus the sure
                uncertainty [<a href="#tln_0580" class="ref lb">580</a>] of the
              equilibrium. This, I suggest, is the distinctive Shakespearian
              ambiguity. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The irony is that Antipholus seems thus to be speaking the language of
              incestuous passion [to Luciana] while he is expressing his soul’s pure
                truth [<a href="#tln_0824" class="ref lb">824</a>], just as Adriana is
              unwittingly wanton when she urges the same Antipholus to be true to her as a husband
              should. Virtuous words in equivocal situation. . . . The enchantment comes from
              everybody’s many-hued uncertainty about himself. . . .

            But the real purpose of Shakespeare’s . . . comedy is not to offer a
              way out of ambiguity. It is much rather to face it. The escapes which they propose may
              well have mostly to do with their own obsessions. There is indeed in these escapes
              something curiously reminiscent of the terror inspired by the two tragic errors linked
              together in the Oedipus story: killing the father and marrying the mother. Which of
              the two sacrilegious deeds each dramatist found most unthinkable may be reflected in
              his attempt to turn the other alternative into a comic issue. But Shakespeare and
              Molière are at their comic best in the spirit which prompts them to laugh and make us
              laugh at our anxious fear of the great tragic doom.

            pp. 528–34): If we were to formulate a kind of comedy which would fulfill the
              demands associated with the pre-oedipal period [the child before he has learned to
              channel all his libidinal energy into the pursuit of a woman who will take the place
              of his mother], it would have many of the aspects which critics find annoying in
                <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>. The family would be more important
              than anyone outside the family, and the mother would be the most important member of
              the family. Security and happiness would be sought not in sexual intercourse with a
              person of the opposite sex but in reunion with or creation of a person like the person
              the protagonist would like to become, i.e., his alter ego, or, more correctly, his
              ideal ego. There would be an ambivalent attitude toward women in the play, because the
              young child (male) depends upon his mother for sustenance but fears being
              reincorporated by the mother. Such fears of the overwhelming mother might be expressed
              in terms of locked doors and bondage, but the positive nurturing mother would occasion
              concern with feasting and drinking. There might even be ambivalent situations, such as
              banquets arranged by threatening women, and ambivalent symbols, such as gold rings or
              chains, which suggest both attraction and restriction.</p>

              differentiate himself. She projects to us the image of what we shall become; but it is
              a fragile image, and if we lose it we risk reintegration with her, reabsorption, a
              reversal of the process of individuation which we suffer from the sixth to the
              eighteenth month. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">As Shakespeare expands the cast and develops themes only implicit in
              the <i>Menaechmi</i>, he provides a complete view of the relation
              between man and wife and clearly indicates the preparation for this relation in the
              male child’s attitude toward the mother. We see the women almost entirely
            through S. Antipholus’s eyes. (P. 531): They are the dark woman (Adriana,
                <i>atro</i>) and the fair maid (Luciana,
                <i>luce</i>) we meet with so frequently in
              literature, comprising the split image of the mother, the one threatening and
              restrictive, the other yielding and benevolent.</p>

              acknowledge the central position of these two passages in the argument of the play,
              but they do not account for their effectiveness. The impact of the repetition is due
              to the reversal of the protagonist’s expectations. He came seeking his mirror image,
              like Narcissus, his ideal ego, his mother’s image of himself, and finds instead a
              woman who claims to be part of himself: and she threatens him with that absorption and
              lack of identity which he had so feared: she is the overwhelming mother. . . . In his
              speech he was the drop of water; in her speech the drop of water is let fall as an
              analogy, but he becomes again that drop of water and flees from the woman who would

            psychological relationships within his own family. He doesn’t attempt tragedy regularly
            until he has outdone his father. Shakespeare’s earlier work is shaped by a very
              strong identification with the cherishing role of the parents of early

              identification with maternal, cherishing attitudes, motivating it at deep levels, is
              the danger of being abandoned or overpowered. So a central preoccupation of the early

            definition (<i>OED</i>) as a dramatic work (usually
              short) which has for its sole object to excite laughter. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>237</i>] What is of chief importance in
              understanding farce, then, is the recognition that the plot’s aggression is punitive,
              and meaningfully so—a recognition in turn dependent upon the reconstruction of the
              characters’ [<i>238</i>] disguised, denied transgressions.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Turning to <i>Err.</i>, <a href="#b_freb1980b" class="ref bibl">Freedman</a> begins an analysis that depends on three
            assertions that are either wrong or unproven. First, There has been no successful
              attempt to uncover a method to the mad confusion of the twins’ identities in the main
              plot or a reason for its envelopment by a frame plot containing their father’s woes.
              The cause of this critical standstill is a plot rife with contradictions, omissions,
              discontinuities, and disclaimers. The section on structure, , details many successful
              attempt[s] to deal with the play on other than psychoanalytic terms. Second,
            Egeon’s thousand mark ransom or fine is everywhere described as a debt
            (p. 239): Egeon’s doom is also the result of an inability to pay a debt
            (see also <a href="#b_freb1980a" class="ref bibl">Freedman</a>,  “Egeon’s Debt,”  1980); her whole
            analysis depends on this notion. But a debt is anything . . . which one person
              is under an obligation to pay or render to another (<i>OED</i>, 1) and an obligation is an agreement . . . whereby a
              person . . . become[s] bound to the payment of a sum of money (<i>OED</i>, 2 <i>Law</i>); to call Egeon’s
            fine or ransom anything like an agreement, without at least arguing for
            the definition, torments the language too much, even though we speak, probably too
            loosely, of a criminal’s paying a debt to society. Third (p. 240),
              The highlight of Egeon’s story is equally a failure to return home [equal to E.
              Antipholus’s], which, while it is melodramatically presented to us as the result of
                cruel fate [there is no such phrase in the play, but see <a href="#tln_0143" class="ref lb">143–4</a>], is not the
              first such incident in his biography. It is, however, the one instance in which
              Egeon’s separation from his spouse is attributed to external forces, earlier
              separations being attributed once to business ([<a href="#tln_0045" class="ref lb">45–6</a>]), and once, most significantly, to personal
              preference ([<a href="#tln_0062" class="ref lb">62–4</a>]). Freedman must misread My wife, not meanely prowd of two
              such boyes, Made daily motions for our home returne: Vnwilling I agreed, alas, too
              soone we came aboord, where there is no separation in our home
              returne and no personal preference save not wanting to set sail as a family in
              Vnwilling I agreed; her citation seems not to include
              alas . . . aboord.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Less problematic is her use of <i>debt</i> to describe marital
            relations; the uncited origin of the metaphor is 1 Cor. 7:3,
            which thereafter becomes almost universally employed by writers on Christian marriage;
            but the source might be acknowledged since it is central to her thesis. With these
            objections in mind, we may follow her essay.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 239): Presented with a knockabout farce obsessed with the anguish and
              punishment of unpaid debts, yet notably devoid of any significant and valid debt, we
              are led to consider the hypothesis that the play is censoring or dislocating the
              debt’s significance and validity; further, that it is this censoring activity which
              enables the play of otherwise unacceptable aggressive content associated with the
              debt. More simply, the hypothesis is that the play’s harsh confrontation and
              punishment of unpaid debts is only made acceptable, indeed humorous, by disguising and
              dislocating its content and validity. Our strategy would then be to seek possible
              points of dislocation or displacement in the pattern of debts that might lead to the
              recovery of meaning.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">On the basis of the centrality of Egeon’s debt, the play works out patterns of (p. 238)
              crime-punishment-forgiveness and
              debt-payment-redemption. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>240</i>] Somehow, the twins’ confrontation of
              mistaken debts, as well as their mistaken fulfillment of debts, is a means of paying a
              real debt, of working out Egeon’s redemption. The denial of the significance of the
              twins’ confrontation of debts is thus invalidated. Furthermore, were the twins not
              confronting Egeon’s actual debt, this advance from his bondage to his freedom would be
              unwarranted. We are thus left with the thesis that the validity of the twins’ debt is
              to be found in Egeon’s situation; perhaps the meaningful content of Egeon’s debt and
              the transgression associated with it may be found in the twins’ situation.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Egeon’s real transgression was his desire to be separated from his wife—his own
              guilty wish for independence—which accounts for his eighteen-year delay in
            setting out to find her and his (p. 241) passive acceptance of a
              decidedly obscure punishment. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Finally, the fact that Egeon’s initial situation couples indebtedness
              with separation from others, whereas his release from debt results in his reunion with
              his wife, also suggests that his debt is indeed marital rather than monetary. Thus
              there is a sense in which the marital debt is both significant and valid and provides
              a meaningful link between the frame plot and the main plot. Since the monetary debts
              contracted do not fulfill this condition, it seems justified to consider that they are
              a disguised expression of the marital debt and that the meaningful content of Egeon’s
              debt is disclosed in the marital debts that his sons confront.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The twins are symbolic functions of two sides of Egeon. (P. 242): Antipholus of Ephesus is quite literally the part of Egeon that has remained lost
              with his wife since the storm finally separated the couple; Antipholus of Syracuse is
              that part of Egeon that has remained with him. Antipholus of Ephesus is married to a
              demanding wife, as his father was long ago, while Antipholus of Syracuse is a
              bachelor, as Egeon is now. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The play, then, is not simply about the payment of debts or the physical
              division and reunion of a family, but about the psychic division and integration of a
              personality, the reintegration of a long-denied part of oneself through psychological
              payment as well. That the path to the integration of Egeon’s personality should
              involve the mistaken identification of single and married twins with
              each other may seem immediately less problematic. That the miraculous
              recovery of Egeon’s past marital [<i>243</i>] identity depends upon
              the mistaken confrontation of marital debts may also seem more logical.
              The farcical misunderstandings of identity, the absurd series of debts directed at the
                wrong man, are not as nonsensical as they first appear. The two
              actions are one; the errors no errors at all.

              ( “Egeon’s Debt,”  1980) repeats much of the preceding essay. One
            problem in this essay is the paucity of quotation, which leads to the reader’s not
            always recognizing the context (p. 371): Antipholus of Syracuse no sooner enters
              Ephesus than he is led by the device of mistaken identities to believe he has lost all
              his money. Having just learned of the precarious state of Syracusans in Ephesus,
              Antipholus of Syracuse fears that he will incur the debt which, unknown to him, his
              father has contracted. His financial situation is no sooner clarified than he is
              mistakenly accused of marital neglect by his sister-in-law, Adriana, who claims of him
              the obligations of husband to wife. The substitution of marital for monetary
              indebtedness is significant; it leads to the first possibility of redemption in the
              play. Antipholus of Syracuse follows Adriana to his brother’s home, where he is
              promised a full dinner and Adriana’s forgiveness. This is a plausible account
            of parts of 1.2 and 2.2, but one looks in vain for S. Antipholus’s fear that he will
            likewise incur the debt that has been assessed Egeon (indeed, his failure
            to wonder about the <i>Syracusian</i> Marchant at <a href="#tln_0165" class="ref lb">165</a> is odd) or for Adriana’s promise of
              forgiveness, though it is implied in shrive you (<a href="#tln_0604" class="ref lb">604</a>). This essay emphasizes various levels of
            redemption and reconciliation, especially citing Eph. 2:14–3:1
            as one more significant passage linking the Epistle and the play.</p>

            321): In the comedies, the conflicts between emotional distance and control do
              not require death for their resolution. Thus the distance between parent and child is
              often presented largely as geographic distance and physical disguise. . . . In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, [S.] Antipholus speaks movingly of his
              separation from his parents [sic: his mother and brother], caused by the romance plot
              conventions of tempest and shipwreck. Here, and in the romances as well, such
              externally enforced family separation could dramatize the frequent separation of
              Elizabethan families by death and standard child-rearing practices. Feeling separation
              as rejection probably alternated with feeling it as beyond human control like tempest
              and shipwreck. The reticence that the Antipholus brothers keep in their reunion—they
              never speak directly to each other—may show that the ideal of emotional control
              continues its claims even at the happy ending. At the corresponding point, the
              Menaechmi twins . . . speak to each other with feeling, and we might expect even more
              eloquence at the father-son reunion not found in the source, but we do not get it.
              This inarticulacy allows the actors to fill in with gestures, of course, and the
              audience with imagination; nevertheless it is interesting that it is the mother who
              has almost all the words of joy at the resolution, and that her imagery turns on
              childbirth [quotes <a href="#tln_1890" class="ref lb">1890–2</a>].</p>

            <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> explores the first part of
              this pattern almost diagrammatically. Antipholus of Syracuse tells us that he loses
              himself in his quest to find his mother and brother ([<a href="#tln_0204" class="ref lb">204</a>]); but the action of the play argues that he can find
              himself only by so losing himself. In the course of the play, he is robbed of those
              external assurances by which identity is normally confirmed and begins to doubt even
              the self-identification of his own memory; his identity is assured only at the
              unravelling that occurs when he and his twin are finally face to face. His identity at
              this moment is contingent upon himself in a mirroring other, a process that Dromio of
              Ephesus makes clear when he says to his own twin, [quotes <a href="#tln_1909" class="ref lb">1909–10</a>]. Identity here develops
              precisely out of the tension between self and other, only in the presence of the
              mirroring twin who is both self and other. 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            But such an identity borders perilously on fusion. . . . The comedy
              depends throughout on just such a tension [quotes <a href="#tln_0199" class="ref lb">199–200</a>] between separation and
              fusion, so that we are always struggling to see which twin is which as we unravel the
              plot. In fact the end of the play emphasizes the process by which identity is created
              out of a state of undifferentiated fusion. Everyone on stage assumes for a dizzying
              moment that the two Antipholuses are in fact one—which is the natural man, /
                And which the spirit ([<a href="#tln_1818" class="ref lb">1818–19</a>])—and the remaining action discovers who is who
              only by a sometimes tedious insistence on the separateness of events, in effect
              separating out the identities from the fused mirror-images by detailing what has
              happened to whom. This insistence is unnecessary for the audience, who already knows
              the plot, but apparently necessary for the fantasy about identity embedded here: for
              the recounting of events already familiar to the audience seems to ward off the danger
              that the twins, who discover themselves in the mirror relationship, will simply fuse.
              If <i>Comedy</i> is thus about the tenuousness of identity, it
              leaves us with a radical image of the frail arena of the self: for the twins must be
              separated out from one another to know who they are; and yet they can know who they
              are only by seeing themselves mirrored in one another. . . .

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>93</i>] In <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i> . . . the recovery of male bonds is suggestively associated with the
              return of the mother, as though the two are necessarily simultaneous, or at bottom
              one. The simultaneity of this recovery is I think behind Shakespeare’s rather odd
              impulse to join the <i>Menaechmi</i> with the story of Apollonius of
              Tyre. . . . At the start, Antipholus of Syracuse claims to be searching for both
              brother and mother, and although the search for the mother is forgotten . . . her
              return in the surprise ending perfectly satisfies the longings suggested by
              Antipholus’s initial description of the hopelessness of his search [<a href="#tln_0199" class="ref lb">199–204</a>]. . . . From the point of
              view of a drop of water, it presumably does not much matter whether one fuses with
              another drop or with an ocean: either failing to find or finding entails loss of
              self. . . . Antipholus’s logic works to suggest that finding the drop should
              forestall the larger fusion; but the metaphor itself belies this logic. . . . For the
              search to find oneself in brother and mother is also a search for fusion in which the
              self will be lost.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            We may begin to understand the force of this fusion both feared and [<i>94</i>] desired if we locate Antipholus’s metaphoric speech in its
              imagined point of literal embodiment in the play. The initial description of the
              splitting of each pair of twins, and of the parents, during their sea voyage gives us
              a cataclysmic image of oceanic divorce ([<a href="#tln_0107" class="ref lb">107</a>]) that seems clearly the emotional foundation for
              Antipholus’s metaphor of the self confounded in the ocean. But at the same time, this
              cataclysmic image allows us to understand the desire for fusion inherent in
              Antipholus’s watery metaphor. For the sea-splitting is in part a re-imagining of the
              divorce of birth itself, a fearful birth felt not as individuation but as
              incompletion. . . . Antipholus’s desire to find his twin—his desire for the fusion of
              one drop with another—is the desire to undo the violent sea-splittings that initiate
              the wanderings, the errors, of the play. In that sense, the starting point for the
              play’s insistence on the search for the split-off mirror self is the radical sense of
              separation from the mother. . . . Hence the power of Antipholus’s desire for fusion
              and the plot-magic by which the recovery of the twin-self dissolves into the recovery
              of the mother. Hence too the utter appropriateness with which the Abbess redefines
              birth itself by associating the recovery of her children, with their birth, with the
              long-awaited parturition: [quotes <a href="#tln_1890" class="ref lb">1890–2</a>]. . . .

            The condensation in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> of the
              search for the mirroring self and the search for the mother may allow us to
              understand . . . the force of male bonding in Shakespeare’s works. . . . For the
              mirror relationship is . . . transitional: it allows for a new sense of self based on
              separateness from the mother while maintaining the fluidity of the boundaries between
              self and other characteristic of that first relationship. In that sense it offers
              protection against engulfment by the mother while allowing for the comforts of the
              union. Both the desire for fusion and the protection offered by the mirror
              relationship are perfectly captured by the illogic of Antipholus’s metaphor of the
              drops and the ocean: in his imagination, fusion with the other identical drop will
              somehow prevent fusion with the mother-ocean. For the male bond protects against total
              fusion with the mother by replicating the early mother-child relationship with a
              difference—replicating it not in its choice of object but [<i>95</i>]
              in its choice of mode: not by choosing a woman who can then be imaginatively linked
              with the mother, as in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> or <i>Othello</i>, but by choosing a twin-self with whom one can be
              fused.

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            I will set the Shakespearean quest for masculine selfhood in the context
              of the family and the life cycle. From the beginning of his career to the end,
              Shakespeare sought a dramatic and psychological strategy for dealing not only with our
              common ambivalence toward our families but specifically with the male passage from
              being a son to being a father. He found it through the romance, in one of its [<i>218</i>] typical patterns of action that I shall call the
                providential tempest. [<i>Err.</i>, <i>TN</i>, <i>Per.</i>, <i>WT</i>, <i>Tmp.</i>] all . . . depict the separation of family members in a
              literal or metaphorical tempest; the resulting sorrow and confusion; and the ultimate
              reunion of the family, with a renewed sense of identity or rebirth for its members.
              This pattern is that of a journey, and it suggests a passage through time as well as
              through space—the individual’s passage from emotional residence within the family to
              independence and adulthood. As depicted . . . the tempest and shipwreck initiating
              the main action represent the violence, confusion, and even terror of passing from one
              stage of life to the next, the feeling of being estranged from a familiar world and
              sense of self without another to hang onto. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Reading these five plays as a group, we watch a process of identity
              formation highlighted in two significantly related crises: that of the youth emerging
              from the family, more than a child but still not a man, and that of the father who has
              not yet fully accepted his fatherhood.
            <a href="#b_kahc1980" class="ref bibl">Kahn</a> cites Erik
            Erikson on identity formation, when in adolescence the instinctual and social
              pressures for intimacy with the opposite sex and pressures to form a stable
            line of work and way of life produce a crisis, forcing the individual back into the
            family, into the identifications of the early, preoedipal stage of ego building.
              In effect, the adolescent reexperiences separation and individuation, but not solely
              through his mother.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She also refers to Peter Blos, who says that adolescence is characterized by mourning
            for the loss of the (p. 219) strongest love [the adolescent] has known thus far,
              his love for his parents. In his mourning, he identifies with them, or
              one of them. But he does this indirectly, by merging narcissistically with persons who
              can mirror him as that parent once did. In effect, he recapitulates the symbiotic
              merger with the mother preceding individuation, leading in stages to
              the search for a heterosexual object [characterized] by an overwhelming hunger
              for a love object of the same sex, in which the real identity of the object, the
              parent of the same sex, is denied. Whether it is positive or negative, identification
              with this same-sex object is necessary, as part of the mourning process, before
              heterosexual love can exist. It is this process of mourning the loss of the parent by
              identification, and finding a new object of love after working through the
              identification, that <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> and <i>Twelfth Night</i> depict.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Further points she makes: Psychoanalytic discussions of doubling are indebted to Freud
            and Rank. For Freud the double is (p. 220) uncanny, a
              mental representation of something familiar and homelike but [also] secret, strange,
              and sinful—a representation . . . of our earliest sexual feeling and wishes with
              regard to our parents, which we later perceive as guilty, repress, and
              hide. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>221</i>] Freud and Rank also stress the double’s
              power to bind the hero to his oedipal past in another way. The double . . . is a
              potential death bringer, a projection of the castrating oedipal father, while at the
              same time it represents the hero’s beloved, narcissistically overestimated self. The
              double makes the hero’s life a torment, but the hero’s life also depends on the
              double’s existence.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In <i>Err.</i> the twin preserves a link with the past but also helps
            the other twin find a mate and so make a break. S. Antipholus seeks his brother,
            grieving for the loss, but through the mistaken identity finds Luciana.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            But in their searching and grieving, Antipholus S. and Viola are both regressing
              to the earliest stage of identity formation: identification with one perceived as
              being the same as oneself.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh. changes names from Menaechmus (she neglects Sosicles) (p. 222) to
              Antipholus, from the Greek <i>anti</i>

              opposed to, citing <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed. 1962, p. 2: Antipholus appears to stem from the
              Greek Antiphilos, listed as a proper name for a lover in H. Estienne
              [Stephanus], <i>Thesaurus Græcae Linguae</i> [1572], but we do not
              know where Shakespeare found it.) As each character is introduced, we
              see that he feels uprooted and alienated from himself because he has lost the
                other closest to him. (This uprooting, it may be objected, is
            not true of anyone but S. Antipholus.) Luciana (p. 223) would drown him, but she
              will rescue him, save him. Metaphorically, she will save him from that obliteration of
              self, that inauthentic metamorphosis into another person, which her sister promised:
                [<i>224</i>] [quotes <a href="#tln_0832" class="ref lb">832–6</a>]. Likewise with S. Dromio’s parody,
            861–936: Dromio’s fears of being lost in Luce prove contagious; by the end of Act
              III, Antipholus S. regards Luciana as a mermaid luring him to death by
              drowning.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Possession by spirits is the third metaphor for the loss of ego identity. Dr. Pinch’s
            exorcisms are in vain. The real deliverance from the bonds of error is by angelic
              power. Pauline word play runs through the scenes focusing on Antipholus E.’s arrest;
              mistakenly and to no avail, he seeks deliverance from the sargeant’s bonds with the
              coins—angels—which will pay his debt [she refers to Acts 12].
              These echoes of Paul’s miraculous deliverance from prison prepare us for the
              denouement at the abbey, wherein the evil powers of Lapland sorcerers and Circe’s cup
              show themselves to be providence in disguise.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Emphasis on time shows the development of identity as process rather than a
              fixed state. . . . [<i>225</i>] Emilia’s final lines firmly link this
              sense of time with a sense of identity as growth in time—the serious and realistic
              theme underlying the farce: [quotes <a href="#tln_1890" class="ref lb">1890–2</a>].</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_berr1985" class="ref bibl">Berry</a>’s (1985,
            pp. 34–43) is a Jungian reading: [<i>Err.</i>] is
              rooted in the collective subconscious, and archetypes of enduring power are presented.
              The plot itself is a playful rendering of the hostile brother motif. . . . Here, [<i>35</i>] the brothers are unwitting not hostile; it is only through
              ignorance that Antipholus of Syracuse intrudes upon his brother’s domain. The
              Syracusan appears, archetypally, to be the younger brother; he is
              defensive, apprehensive, easily daunted (but luckier, for all that). . . . The
                elder brother is passionate, overbearing, a fighter. This mutuality
              of temperament is a part of the psychic integration of the play. Then again, Luciana
              provides perhaps the clearest statement in Shakespeare of the anima archetype. [Quotes
                <a href="#tln_0850" class="ref lb">850–3</a>.] She, for
              Antipholus, is the embodiment of this omnipresent and ageless image &lt;of
                woman&gt; which corresponds to the deepest reality in man [quoting Jung,
                <i>Aion</i>]. The final transformation of the anima is the Abbess,

              one’s desires. The other is that of loss, shattered identity, pain. The first line is
              stronger, and its triumph never really in doubt. The second is always present, often
              uppermost, at all times shadowing the experience of cast and audience. Threat and

            the locking out of the rightful husband while his double makes love to Alcmena; some of
            Shakespeare’s audience would get that allusion. But everyone would receive the
              impression of sexual congress behind locked doors. . . . Adriana is clearly in a mood
              to charm her husband, and is insistent that they are <i>not</i> to be
              disturbed: [quotes <a href="#tln_0602" class="ref lb">602–7</a>]. The audience is now to be teased with a sexual fantasy,
            confirmed by the bawdry of Are you there, wife? You might have come
              before ([<a href="#tln_0710" class="ref lb">710–11</a>]), Your cake here is warm within ([<a href="#tln_0725" class="ref lb">725</a>]), It would make a man mad as a buck to be so

            this is certainly bawdry. The audience, he says, believes that the sex has occurred,
            despite his quoting of Adriana’s parting Come sister, <i>Dromio</i> play the Porter well [which might add exhibitionism and
            voyeurism to the proceedings]. E. Antipholus likewise supposes that he has been
            cuckolded, hence makes plans for (p. 40) a sexual revenge with the
            Courtesan, depending on <i>Ile knocke else-where, to see if they’ll
              disdaine me</i> (<a href="#tln_0782" class="ref lb">782</a>): Knocking is standard slang for sexual entry. But above all, the
              double-entendres and bawdry of the text stem from the stage symbolism itself: the
              house, perceived from earliest times as the coding for woman, and the knocking at the
              gates, the male attempts at entry. The symbolism is the more charged if the nature of
              the inner action is considered. What is held before the audience as a <i>theatrical</i> possibility is incest. . . . Here in III.i, at the
              midpoint of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, incest is the compelling

              assert narrative logic, making <i>Err.</i> a play unified by

            to find a way to unify the play (how can the Egeon plot and the mistakes plot be
            harmonized, as they must be if the play is to be honored as more than a farce?) means
            only that she is not satisfied by earlier successes. And her lack of quotation in favor
            of summary, noted above, continues (p. 86): We no sooner consider ourselves
              superior in awareness to the twin Antipholi than we recall that these
                masters imagine themselves superior to their wives, who in turn enjoy
              superiority over their servants, who in turn feel superior to their
              women. That the play does not have these plural relationships undercuts the

            (1995, pp. 191, 195, 200–1, 204–6, 209, 224–5): In <i>Err.</i>
            Shakespeare vacillates between presenting the self as an acquired and as
              an inherent property. This ambiguous self . . . is caught up in specifically

                self as a transpersonal and social, rather than an individual,
              construction. . . . Strictly speaking, Antipholus of Syracuse achieves a stable sense
              of self, and a name proper to it, as a <i>consequence</i> of finding his mirroring fellow: his identity, such
              as it is, is an effect of doubling rather than given before such
              reduplication. . . . </p>

                Errors</i>, the self is a self-reflexive entity that knows itself only through
              absence, loss, and a differential relationship with an other
              fellow from its inception. This [water-drop] soliloquy alerts the
              audience to expect that Antipholus’s accumulating sense of self-loss in relation to
              others will be the error that Act V will correct when he finds a
                mother and a [<i>201</i>] brother. The comedy solves
              the errors of identity by providing him with a place next to his twin, in front of the
              community, so that everyone can give back to him an identity he accepts as his

              resonances of wandering in the <i>error</i> of the
              title indicate, as does Lacan, that when the subject identifies with its mirrored
              other, the act of identification provides a visual structure, a framework for the
              inchoate body’s spatial coordination.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The agent for discovering identity is the mother Aemilia who verifies as other the

                (<a href="#tln_1813" class="ref lb">1813–14</a>)]—since
              no one subject in the play knows the answer until such knowledge is
              produced by the moment of the twins’ pairing—than <i>the mere fact of
                her presence</i>. Her act of bringing the Syracusan twin on stage with his
              mirroring brother . . . begins to set the morning story right ([<a href="#tln_1832" class="ref lb">1832</a>]).</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Reestablishing an ordered identity for both sets of twins requires an (p. 209)

            the Dromios subvert that resolution. The other brothers do not joyfully speak to each
            other as lost fellows as their servants do. They avoid the mirrored relationship
              between fellows, and thus the dialectical fictions producing the identity that
              Antipholus of Syracuse once sought in order to find himself. This evasion, I propose,
              occurs because the Dromios reveal that the mirroring exchange is a never-ending
              process rather than a closed book.</p>

              controlling framework of male narcissism—a shaping projection of the self based on the
              model of the male body that organizes its own version of loving sameness as the
              generous sharing of him selfe. The play’s ordering of marital relations
              revolves around subtexts that insist on female chastity [Aemilia’s becoming a nun] and
              on a wife’s meriting esteem as part of one flesh only if she is
              obedient to her husband’s self and body. It is in the context of this
              symmetrical, shaping masculine self-love that I [<i>225</i>] would
              situate the language of the final scene: such a self requires a
              mother-turned-nun who inhabits and is herself a special place, a
                sanctuary where errant identity stops wandering or running
              about. . . . But she can become this guarantor or sanctuary for a speaking male
              identity only by being purged of any taint of sexuality.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Modern readers may be puzzled as to why the question of incest appears at all, since
            sleeping with one’s brother’s wife has long since lost its taboo, though not its status
            as adultery. The <i>OED</i> definition, The crime of sexual
              intercourse or cohabitation within the degrees within which marriage is
              prohibited, has as its last citation one dated 1868, and the phrase
              within the degrees blurs the old canon law statements of degrees of
            consanguinity and of affinity (relation by marriage). Canon law in Sh.’s day, and for
            long thereafter, prohibited a man’s <i>marrying</i> his deceased (or
            divorced) brother’s wife; thus by definition S. Antipholus commits incest if he has
            intercourse with Adriana. This prohibition is based on Lev. 18,
            which forbids intercourse outside of marriage in this relationship. A Table of
            Prohibited Degrees was published in 1563 by Archbishop Parker and became Canon 99 in
            1603, which specifically says that such marriages are incestuous. See n.

            But what is missing of skilful management in respect to this plot,
              scarcely weighs in the balance, when we see, how the poet has given to the whole
              extravagant matter of these mistakes and intricacies, an inner relation to the
              character of the family in which he placed them. These comic [<i>188</i>] parts appear upon a thoroughly tragic background, which indeed interferes
              not at all with the extravagant scenes in the fore-ground, perhaps only makes them the
              more conspicuous, but yet every moment appears with sufficient importance to keep
              under the superficial and weak impression of a mere farce, of which the kernel as well
              as the shell consisted in the mistakes of these similar twins. . . . We look upon a
              double family, and its earlier and present destinies, in which the most peculiar
              errors take place, not merely of an external, but of an internal character. In this
              family lie together the strange contrasts of domestic love and a roving spirit; these
              produce alternate happiness and misfortune, and occasion troubles and quarrels, in
              spite of inner congeniality of soul and family attachment, and estrangement and
              perplexity in spite of outward similarity. . . . [<i>189</i>] The
              inducement for this journey [Æmilia’s joining Egeon], the poet has left as a matter of
              conjecture; only so far has he indicated, that if a loving, it was also a wilful
              step. . . . Was it the result of suspicion and jealousy . . . ? We should think so;
              for this Æmelia can subsequently preach to her daughter-in-law with such forcible
              warning against this passion. . . . A lively impulse works in them [Egeon and S.
              Antipholus], as in the mother before, to unite the family, and this very impulse
              separates them ever more, and threatens at length to separate them forcibly and for
              ever.

              perspective, the Renaissance was a crucial period in the transition from a medieval,

            Shakespeare puts the argument derived from Pauline teaching to use the
              first time he presents the image of a wife protesting her husband’s infidelities.
              Adriana . . . complains to the man she supposes to be her husband that his sexual
              crimes have in turn contaminated her: [quotes <a href="#tln_0535" class="ref lb">535–9</a>]. Here, arguably, Adriana is on firm doctrinal
              ground. But her reproachful tirade also contains a detailed portrait of the way in
              which a husband might be expected to react to the news of his wife’s adultery: [quotes
                <a href="#tln_0525" class="ref lb">525–32</a>]. Her
              implication, clearly, is that the wife of an adulterer is entitled to experience some
              measure of the typical wronged husband’s outrage. As indirect and as limited in scope
              as is this endorsement of sexual parity, it is nonetheless part of the play’s larger
              portrait of Adriana as a woman on the verge of falling into the heresy of rejecting
              the divine law of sexual subordination. Her sister Luciana, a contrasting proponent of
              sweet reason and orthodox belief, must listen to Adriana querulously ask why men’s
              liberty should be more than women’s, and [listen as] . . . her good counsel is
              rejected contemptuously: [quotes <a href="#tln_0288" class="ref lb">288</a>]. The
              last point Adriana [<i>12</i>] raises, in her efforts to seduce
              Luciana into admitting that there are limits to the amount of wifely submission that a
              woman should be willing to exhibit, is the crucial question of whether she would
              endure her husband’s adultery: [quotes <a href="#tln_0304" class="ref lb">304</a>]. Luciana . . . gives the response that is the ultimate guarantee of her
              freedom from her sister’s taint: [quotes <a href="#tln_0305" class="ref lb">305</a>].

              prohibited. . . . The wife who takes this approach [of equality] may be seen as
              deluded, even dangerous—but the test she fails to pass is conceded to be the ultimate
              trial of her feminine submissiveness. In Shakespeare’s drama, which is shaped by [this
              view], the wife who . . . resists the temptation to question the double standard or
              to criticize her husband, has given the extreme proof of her worth as a

            pp. 112 ff.), after reviewing the literature and statutes that subject wives to husbands
            in terms of property ownership, sexual fidelity, and so on, says, It is
              hard to believe that English women, particularly married women, were considered to
              possess a freedom of conduct unique in Western Europe. Shakespeare . . . obviously
              understood the problems encountered by women as a result of their required
              subordination in marriage and in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> he
              bases the subplot on some of them. At the same time he establishes his own pattern for
              marriage comedies. A matrimonial relationship is challenged by an independent woman
              (perhaps a shrew); problems ensue, with adultery sometimes alleged; and finally a
              resolution is reached. The woman usually accommodates her outward conduct to that of
              the man, but in also asserting her love, she shows such freedom of spirit that roles
              and attitudes are redefined in a marriage that is evolving towards mutuality and
              companionship. The husband is no longer foolish or tyrannous, the wife no longer
              shrewish, and the laws of fidelity and chastity are upheld.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">That Shakespeare intended the subplot . . . to be more than mere
              contrast . . . is obvious from his setting the play in Ephesus, with Eph.’s
            exhortation to wifely obedience. This biblical resonance is increased by the
              deliberate patterning of the debate between Adriana and Luciana after the
                Conjugium, one of the colloquies of Erasmus which Shakespeare may
              well have studied in school. In Erasmus, Xantippe is the archetypal shrew and Eulalia,
              the wife who speaks well of matrimony. She [<i>113</i>] preaches that
              the wife should be the looking glass of her husband . . . showing forbearance, even
              if the husband takes a mistress. She rehearses the debate and other plot
            elements.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>116</i>] The discovery that the reprehending Abbess is
              Adriana’s mother-in-law is more than a stock joke; it is also an ironic and amusing
              reference to the Erasmian colloquy. There Xantippe is brought to accept her wifely
              duties and practice patience only when Eulalia forces her to the realization that both
              her step-mother and her mother-in-law would be most gratified to see the couple
              separate. Thus in Erasmus, the redefinition of the wife’s role comes from an external
              influence, whereas in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> it represents an
              internal development. Even in this early comedy Shakespeare is treating the shrew with
              some humanity. . . . Both Adriana and Luciana have developed in the course of the
              play—something unusual in a farce—and both have learned something of the <i>realpolitik</i> of marriage. . . . At the
              conclusion of the play Adriana has certainly not gained the mastery, though she does
              now have something with which to upbraid her husband, while he does not. What is
              important is that her shrewishness has been revealed as a reaction to the frustration
              of those deprived of legitimate liberty. . . . Adriana has shown her mettle and now
              accepts her wifely duties with love.</p>

              The moral seems to be clear: if the husband errs, the wife should accept
              it. . . . The important point . . . is that most Elizabethans would have agreed with
              the Abbess and recognised that wives should not too much mind the sexual lapses on the
              part of their husbands though they themselves should lead totally chaste and
              unblemished lives. He scorns the double standard.</p>

            that Luciana does no more than speak one orthodoxy, that of female submissiveness in
            marriage, and Adriana argues for another, one that opposes the double standard of
            morality and the analogy between husband-wife and master-servant. But he studies
              the comedy’s external system of communication that guides our response.
              What we are faced with . . . is a whole system of interdependent delicate
              balances, or labile equilibriums, on virtually every level of the scene. The <i>débat</i> resembles a verbal duel, in which both
              sides can score points, but which ultimately ends in a draw. With this scene we are
              given an instance of something like a spot of indeterminacy. By its
              very nature it creates a kind of vacuum, which draws the recipient into the

              <a href="#b_broj1957" class="ref bibl">Brown</a> (1957,
            pp. 54–6): Following the clues of the sonnets and <i>Romeo
                and Juliet</i>, the ideal of love’s wealth may be seen to inform the very
              earliest comedies. <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is, in the main, an
              intrigue comedy which aims at making a certain number of characters look ridiculous;
              it deals, therefore, not with the joy of giving in love, but with the follies and
              evils of possessiveness. Adriana’s idea of love is to try to maintain a hold over her
              husband; the liberty of his actions galls her and she demands her rights. As part of
              this plan, she obtains the promise of a gold chain. Instead of the willing
                loan of free agents, Adriana sees love as a system of
              promises, duties and bonds. Even at her most submissive, when she cajoles her
              husband’s twin . . . to come home as her husband, she harps upon rights and
              possessions: [quotes <a href="#tln_0567" class="ref lb">567–72</a>]. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>55</i>] This kind of love is further defined by
              contrasted loves, that of Antipholus of Syracuse who offers himself to Luciana
              unasked, and for whom giving is its own reward: [quotes <a href="#tln_0834" class="ref lb">834–8</a>] or that of Luce who deals only
              in claims and possessions: [quotes <a href="#tln_0872" class="ref lb">872–9</a>]. This is the level of merely possessive love; and
              the fact is driven home by bringing these three loves together in one brief
              scene.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            There are further contrasts in the juxtaposition of misunderstandings
              about love and misunderstandings about the possession of servants, a gold chain, and a
              bag of ducats. For the like of Adriana there is little difference between them; so
              when the Goldsmith asks for his money on the strength of a bond, Antipholus of Ephesus
              in his refusal likens the confusion to Adriana’s sort of marriage: [quotes <a href="#tln_1034" class="ref lb">1034–7</a>]. [<i>56</i>] But there is one difference between the two kinds of
              misunderstandings: those between masters and men, and merchant and purchaser are
              occasioned solely by confused identities . . . but Adriana’s misunderstandings, her
              claims of rights and wrongs, ante-date any mistaken identity. The merchants treat
              their possessions naturally as best they may, Adriana treats hers unnaturally—her
              merchandise requires the use of love’s wealth in which giving is more important than
              taking or keeping.

              proper ordering of a household, in courtship the woman enjoys a superior position.
              Courtship is not, then, very good training for marriage. Women who take seriously such
              lavish expressions of praise and worship as sonnet lovers heap upon them will not take
              easily to the altered marital situation. Such praise the lover in <i>The
                Comedy of Errors</i> heaps upon Luciana; he calls her our earth’s
                wonder,
              more than earth divine,
              a god,

              however, he gets freedom from no bonds at all and is finally symbolically tied in the

              restrictive than the bonds just lost. With freedom comes binding, but with the

              approaching marriage is politely but firmly put to one side, as something to be

              a short spell, to the ordinary world of men and to its problems of how they are to
              live together. . . . It is an instinct that has made Shakespeare so widely loved and
              the lack of which explains the comparative neglect of Spenser. The extent to which he

              indeed been laying up trouble for himself, for not only is he shockingly late for
              dinner but he is bringing with him two guests, probably unnotified and certainly

              accepted social ceremony that helps define his identity as respected citizen and
              respectful husband. It is surely no coincidence that in the course of the play he is
              threatened with the loss of both of these socially and emotionally vital aspects of

            When viewed in this context Adriana’s behavior assumes a deeper and more
              richly suggestive character than the mere ragings of a jealous housewife. Her

              late ([<a href="#tln_0277" class="ref lb">277</a>]) indicates a serious attempt
              to maintain personal equilibrium and social bonds in the face of heavy pressures.
              Adriana . . . is a fiercely combative woman confronting squarely the threat of an
              imperiled marriage and determined to sustain meaningful ties despite social and
              personal threats to her identity as wife and Lady. . . . [Luciana’s urging them to
              dine shows an] [<i>226</i>] indifference to her sister’s emotional
              plight that reveals the severe limitations of the unwedded woman’s easy aphorisms
              about marriage ([<a href="#tln_0289" class="ref lb">289–99</a>]).

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_canj1990" class="ref bibl">Candido</a> reports
            anthropological studies affirming the close connection between food and sexual longings
            and sexual identity. (P. 227): Adriana’s renewed enthusiasm for dinner with the
              man she thinks is her husband appears to include such psychological concerns. Despite
              the fact that Luciana will accompany the pair, theirs will be a rather private meal,
                above, symbolically located in the living quarters upstairs rather
              than in the more public business quarters below. . . . Clearly there is more at stake
              here for Adriana than the rearrangement of a disturbed afternoon. Her private family
              meal serves as a convenient social vehicle for the larger issue of forgiveness, and
              her insistence on privacy metaphorically links confidential family matters with the
              equally confidential regenerative power of the confessional: [quotes <a href="#tln_0603" class="ref lb">603–4</a>].</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">E. Antipholus does not share his wife’s highly serious, highly symbolic view of this
            meal time, but still reacts badly when he is shut out.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 229): By virtue of his denied access to home and wife, the Ephesian brother
              comes to experience precisely the same feelings of alienation and sexual doubt that he
              has so casually inflicted upon his wife. . . . Antipholus’s isolation outside the
              locked house functions symbolically to define the spiritual divorce he has already
              produced while at the same time literalizing ominously the ends to which his neglect
              will lead, the anxieties of isolation and nonattachment.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_canj1990" class="ref bibl">Candido</a> says
            that the meal turns sour (p. 230): Perhaps less obvious . . . is the way in
              which the younger Antipholus’s behavior at Adriana’s dinner unwittingly parallels the
              unfaithfulness of his brother. As the symbolic embodiment of the younger version of
              his Ephesian twin, Antipholus of Syracuse reenacts his brother’s behavior by forsaking
              the woman who has welcomed him to the feast and turning his romantic attention to
              another. This slightly misrepresents the play, which has no dinner scene. In
            3.2 Luciana upbraids S. Antipholus for unfaithfulness, but she is apparently talking
            about another woman, perhaps the Courtesan, not herself. In 4.2 Adriana responds to
            Luciana’s report about S. Antipholus’s wooing her in 3.2, not to what happened at the
            table.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 231): Adriana’s broken banquet fails to produce its desired ends, but it
              nonetheless sets in motion a process of moral and social realignment that continues to
              the end of the play. Critics have generally tended to overlook the rejected wife’s
              response to her failed dinner, particularly her remarks upon hearing that at the meal
              her supposed husband has tried to woo Luciana. But again, the wooing takes
            place after the meal. He quotes <a href="#tln_1125" class="ref lb">1125–8</a>, <a href="#tln_1131" class="ref lb">1131–4</a>: The division here between heart and
              tongue . . . focuses upon yet another pair of forceful oppositions embedded in
              singleness. Adriana’s acknowledgement of her inner divisions . . . points implicitly
              to a means of finding concord in discord. Adriana is a frequent object of others’
              criticism . . . yet despite it all she remains the most fully responsive and
              synthetic character in the play, preferring finally in a crisis to labor at
              forgiveness rather than to ease into recrimination.</p>

              scattered members of his domestic hearth, has fallen into the clutches of the law
              which is about to execute him. Thus even the State as well as the untamed elements of
              Nature seem to be hostile to the restoration of the family. But we, the
            audience, see order emerging. We . . . see that the whole is the comedy
              of Accident which is destroying itself by conflicting with the supreme order.
              Providence . . . is bringing the scattered members of the family together, but he
              puts on the mask of confusion, and makes horrible grimaces, whereat the puny
              individual gets frightened. . . . But we must look through the appearance, must peep
              under the providential mask, if we wish to behold the comedy. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>68</i>] The third principle [after family and
              state] which is involved in this entanglement is business—the commercial relations of
              the community. . . . The matter [of not paying for the chain] is at first treated as
              a jest, then it grows serious, and at last an officer is called in to enforce the
              demand. Here Authority is drawn into the meshes, and is victimized by an [<i>69</i>] appearance. . . . Public order is disturbed [and the
              resolution must begin]. But the difficulty cannot rest here; the abbess has defied the
              Family in the wife, and the Law in the officer; the conflict can only be settled by an
              appeal to the supreme authority of the land. But the Duke is likewise deluded,
            and all is clarified by the recognition of the twins.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 72): Mistaken Identity . . . shows how the individual is [sic; word
              missing] through society, and society through the individual. We see that, if one unit
              be displaced and another taken for it, the whole fabric will fall into
              disorder. . . . The individual must have society, in which he finds his true
              relations—he can exist as a reasonable being only in society; on the other hand,
              society requites the favor and recognizes him as this individual, and none other, in
              all his manifold relations, and thus gives him a true objective personality. Mistaken
              Identity steps between society and the individual, and, for a time, destroys their
              connection. Each side, having existence through the other, will, by such separation,
              rapidly pass into confusion and dissolution. But the difficulty rests upon Mistaken
              Identity, not upon Lost Identity; the trouble . . . is not permanent, but the mistake
              is discovered, and the old relations are all restored.</p>

              from intemperate hostility between man and wife must be resolved by the
              generous recognition of an order which permits them both to work

            To pursue human mistaking for a moment, the basis of this form of
              deception is the truism that appearances can be deceiving, and on the Shakespearean
              stage they frequently possess an unassisted subversive power akin to that of
              manipulative agents. Thus in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, as the
              title suggests, the errors themselves are implicitly given the power of
              creating the comedy and so virtually acquire the status of dramatist.
              Yet even in that self-consciously mechanical farce, it is impossible to ignore the
              complicity of self-deception.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">As an example of how subversiveness tends to construct the forces of
                order (p. 75): If there is any figure who
              embodies, rather than merely transmits, the omnipresent energy of transformation, it
              must be the Abbess Aemilia, who provides the answer to the Syracusan’s prayer:
                here we wander in illusions: / Some blessed power deliver us from
                hence![] ([<a href="#tln_1225" class="ref lb">1225–6</a>]). According to the method of trickery, that prayer must first be
              mocked by the entrance of the Courtezan, whose talk of the chain makes her seem
              diabolic. . . . But when the prayer is finally answered, Aemilia’s language joins
              with the miraculous effect of her knowledge to identify her with time’s own discharge
              of its debt to the principle of creation: Thirty-three years have I but gone in
                travail / Of you, my sons, and till this present hour / My heavy burthen ne’er
                delivered [<a href="#tln_1890" class="ref lb">1890–2</a>]. In cutting the Gordian knot woven by the plot’s crossing and
              recrossing, and reinforced imagistically with real chain and rope, she speaks with the
              voice of redemption, as she singles out [Egeon] whose confinement under sentence of
              death emblematizes the predicament of the others: [quotes <a href="#tln_1825" class="ref lb">1825–6</a>].</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            In fact, it is the Abbess’s own application of the disruptive principle
              that brings her face to face with Egeon; for by refusing to release (the wrong)
              Antipholus to be bound by Adriana ([quotes <a href="#tln_1507" class="ref lb">1507</a>]), she provokes the wife to seek redress from the Duke. Precisely in not
              forseeing the consequences of her action, Aemilia behaves like subversiveness [<i>76</i>] itself. . . . By insisting on this separation [of
              1579–80]—again, on principle rather than on purpose—the Abbess recapitulates both the
              divisive means of the play at large and the holy end which those means
              mysteriously accomplish.

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The emphasis on clock time in the play, and S. Dromio’s joking catechism on a
            personified Time in 2.2, leads to analysis of time as a theme. <a href="#b_broh1961" class="ref bibl">Brooks</a> (1961, pp. 57, 68–9): The rendezvous with the merchant, at five o’clock [<a href="#tln_0189" class="ref lb">189</a>] . . . helps establish the theme of
              timing, and the motifs of timely or untimely meetings or failures to
              meet. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>68</i>] The theme of time’s depredations . . . is
              the text of the mock disputation on Time and Hair. . . . The further comic fancy of
              debtor Time turning [<i>69</i>] back an hour when he meets with a
              Sergeant, links those [themes] of untimeliness and reversal of order.</p>

          
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_salg1972" class="ref bibl">Salgādo</a> (1972,
            pp. 82–83, 85, 91): The preoccupation with the movement of time . . . with its
              direction, its pace, and its consequences, does not affect merely the content of the
              play. Since drama in performance is an art which exists in time, a play where the
              involutions and deviations of time are part of the theme may be expected to show this
              in its very structure. (P. 83): He lists many references to clock time, of
            which <i>Err.</i> has more than any other Shn. play.</p>

          
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The design of the play, <i>pace</i> Professor Baldwin, is not really based on a five-act structure on
              the Terentian model. Rather, its eleven scenes consist of an inner action contained
              within an outer one to which it is finally united. The structure of the action
              corresponds to two different aspects of time. The over-arching framework, in spite of
              its threatening implications, is essentially benevolent. Against a ground of moving
              accidents by flood and field, it illustrates the normal workings of the temporal
              process in comedy, speaking of the great commonplaces of wedlock, childbirth, and
              familial piety and pointing the arrow of our expectations towards the fullness of time
              when all disorders are healed and all divisions settled. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Within this outer action . . . the main action takes place in a time
              gone crazy, twisted, looped, turning in on itself, not so much the medium of existence
              as a manifestation of its perplexities, even, at times, of its horror. He then
            reads the play for these features.</p>
          

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He illustrates, pointing to alternations of language that indicate normal time with
            various kinds of dislocations, e.g., (p. 85): Dromio’s feeble pun [<a href="#tln_0208" class="ref lb">208–11</a>], one of several
              quibbles on time which we shall encounter, goes to the heart of the matter. Clock-time
              and inward time have already begun to diverge and E. Dromio tells his supposed master
              as much: Methinks your ma[w], like mine, should be your clock [231,
              with n. on <a href="#s_pope" class="ref witness">Pope</a>’s emendation for <i>cooke</i>]. The doggerel lines
              following the four I have quoted above, each leaning on the other, pile up with
              something of the hectic rhythm of a clock that will not stop striking.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He concludes (p. 91), Our superior awareness prevents us from identifying with
              any of the characters involved, except indirectly. The play remains a farce where
              Shakespeare takes us backstage, as it were, to show us what tricks can be worked with
              time without, for the most part, playing such tricks on us as he does
              in <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> and <i>The
              Tempest</i>. For the moment, we are protected from the puzzlements of time
              dismembered.</p>

            (1975, pp. 215–18) shows how the personification of Time (<a href="#tln_0463" class="ref lb">463–75</a>) makes concrete the theme of
            untimeliness and its consequences mentioned by <a href="#b_broh1961" class="ref bibl">Brooks</a>, above; he emphasizes the emblematic aspect of
            bald Father Time with a forelock to be grasped or the occasion missed.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Critics’ emphasis on commerce in Ephesus takes on thematic dimensions beginning in the
            mid-20th c. as academics start to take the play seriously. Staging of the play began to
            make this commerce visual at least as early as the 1860s; see . <a href="#b_knig1932" class="ref bibl">Knight</a> (1932, pp. 115–16): Now, in this play a family is first
              dispersed by tempest. Next, the action shows a remarkable series of mistakes in a
              magic land of merchants and riches, with a final consummation in union and happiness.
              The play is full of riches imagery especially. He lists lines <a href="#tln_0626" class="ref lb">626</a> (oddly late for that sum of a thousand
            marks, which first appears at <a href="#tln_0025" class="ref lb">25</a>), <a href="#tln_1429" class="ref lb">1429</a>, <a href="#tln_1384" class="ref lb">1384</a>, <a href="#tln_1222" class="ref lb">1222</a>, <a href="#tln_1252" class="ref lb">1252</a>, <a href="#tln_1616" class="ref lb">1616</a>, and
            more. (P. 116): The play is full of gold and other riches, of merchants, and
              sea-voyages.</p>

              and her unabashed self-confidence as an accepted part of society.</p>

            pp. 7–8): Throughout the play there are several small touches conveying
              the Ephesians’ narrow concern with money. The merchant who talks with Antipholus of
              Syracuse . . . is kind enough to warn him against the law; but he refuses an
              invitation to keep him company and join him for dinner, on the grounds that he is
              already engaged to certain merchants, / Of whom I hope to make much
                benefit ([<a href="#tln_0187" class="ref lb">187–8</a>]). The officer who arrests Antipholus of Ephesus refuses to release
              him, even when told he is mad and needs treatment: [<i>8</i>] [quotes
                <a href="#tln_1406" class="ref lb">1406–10</a>].</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            In this commercial world, Antipholus of Ephesus appears to have
              occupied, when the action begins, a solid and respectable place. . . . His marriage,

              unsettling and unpleasant for the victim. . . . But the world of commerce simply goes
              crazy when an irrational factor is introduced, and the only satisfaction is for chains
              and ducats to be restored to their original owners, as though the confusion had never
              taken place. Nothing is gained in the process, for the transactions of business are
              barren and limited, incapable of the sudden, spontaneous enrichment that we see in the
              transactions of love. . . . The only party to gain something is the audience: since
              commercial life has been transacted in such unflattering terms, we are bound to take a

            only on a financial basis; without it, all interaction [<i>Gemütlichkeit</i>] ceases. The exchange of purse, necklace, and

              denoting the delivery of goods in the belief in a future ability to pay.)</p>

              impotence of Egeon, with whom he sympathizes. At the same time, this decentering of
              power must be negated by the exercise of judicial violence. The statutes must be
              sealed in blood. His argument about the Duke’s impotent sympathy for Egeon is
            marred by his repeated statement that Egeon has twenty-four hours to find his

            capitalism separated the domestic from the commercial scene by gender and in space,
            i.e., home and market. While the play sets up . . . opposition between
              husbands and wives, the worlds of trade and home, it ultimately insists upon their
              ever-shifting interrelations. No definite hierarchy emerges; instead the demands of
              business and family alternately and farcically interfere with each other. So, as we
              might expect, the Antipholi and their male associates—merchants, the goldsmith, and
              city magistrates—appear in public scenes and talk in terms of economic exchange and
              legal sanctions, while women converse inside, their talk focusing on
                private topics such as marriage and family, as in Act two, scene
              one . . . and in the beginning of Act five, when the Abbess catechizes Adriana about

              Messenio could wish. The presence of romantic individualism as well as self-interest
              in the procedures of the merchant-adventurer allows Shakespeare to show the world of
              errors, deceptions, and supposes to be one in which loss and gain can be construed in
              terms both of money and emotion. The life depicted in New Comedy provides a natural
              basis for this double take. The <i>Menaechmi</i> views social life
              as a petty competition for goods, for status, and for freedom to impose oneself on
              other people, so as to escape their imposition. Shakespeare by no means denies this
              image, but he is careful to represent the acquisitive life as more socialized and

            Even in the following scene, when the content signals that we have moved

              nature and commerce continues to appear. The merchant we meet here . . . has taken
              good commercial steps to avoid a fate like that we have just witnessed in his father’s
              case: he has banked his money with another (Ephesian) merchant and has a false
              identity prepared in case trouble arises. Sociability is not the source of the compact
              with his Ephesian contact. Business comes first; the Ephesian must leave in order to
              take up an invitation to certain merchants | Of whom I hope to make much

              Own content is, however, a phrase that triggers in Antipholus’ mind
              powerful memories of a different value [<i>123</i>] system in which
              content cannot belong to the individual but only to the family group: [quotes <a href="#tln_0197" class="ref lb">197–204</a>]. What the
              world of Ephesus seems to offer to both Aegeon and Antipholus (and what the art world
              of New Comedy offers to Shakespeare) is an orderly system of time (fixed inside an
              orderly social and commercial system)—time to be used to collect ransom for Aegeon,
              time to undertake the tasks Antipholus must perform in Ephesus; but this is time that
              these isolated individuals can apprehend only as meaningless vacancy, and that the
              society can define only as madness. . . .

            What Shakespeare has done is to take the ordering system of New Comedy
              and place it in an estranging perspective, which shows its assumptions to be not the
                natural but only the learned routines of particular social groups.
              These are, of course, the groups that farce tends to fasten on—those who live too
              securely inside predetermined social systems, those we might call, briefly and
              anachronistically, the bourgeoisie. But, unlike nineteenth-century farce, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, though it redefines private
                content as madness, has a larger purpose than <i>épater les bourgeois</i>.

              that of the <i>Menaechmi</i> with its proposed sale of the
            household goods and wife. <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>
              ends . . . not with a business deal but with a miracle. The play comes back to the
              romance story of old Aegeon. The time of his reprieve is up, but time is no longer a
              merely sequential medium. The solemn procession to the place of execution has hardly
              entered before it is overwhelmed by farcical confusions as various petitioners demand
              contrary assurances about what has happened when. We are given unmistakable signals
              that anagnorisis is upon us; but before that true cadence can sound we must hear once
              again the contrary music of Aegeon’s frustrated longing and despair: [quotes <a href="#tln_1788" class="ref lb">1788–99</a>]. Shakespeare
              has reserved the play’s most powerful poetry for a special effect—to show us the
              tragic abyss of estrangement at the very moment of its comic release. For now romance
              finally absorbs error in a characteristic expression of the comic-miraculous. One by
              one the errors are unpicked and repositioned as truths. But they are not, we should
              notice, discounted: the dinner, the chain, the purse of ducats, the diamond, are
              presented as the factual markers by which any society (not just a bourgeois one) comes
              to know itself. Yet at the same time as these stubborn and irreducible facts are
              asserted, identity is celebrated in terms of a different set of values. At a new
              gossips’ feast the Duke will act as godfather [<i>125</i>] for the
              rechristening of the members of the family miraculously reconstituted. Their names,
              the signs of their belonging together, integrate them not only inside the family but
              also inside the state. A sub-plot coda replays in a final vaudeville exit the comfort
              of established relations: [quotes <a href="#tln_1909" class="ref lb">1909–18</a>]. The simultaneity of a jostling exit makes a
              good theatrical joke; it also raises, one last time, the basic question of the
              competitive ethic, and it offers once again the play’s response, which is not to deny
              it or preach against it, but to set it side by side with the incommensurate ethic of
              brotherhood and family solidarity, and to leave it there without further
              comment. In a footnote to theatrical joke,
            <a href="#b_hung1962" class="ref bibl">Hunter</a> says,
              There may be, in addition, a reference to the Show of Amity in the <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> . . . where the representatives of Gray’s Inn and
              the Inner Temple enter arm in arm to show that their quarrel over precedence has come
              to an end. It is probable that <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> was

              almost disappears, and that the very convictions which we look upon as the most

              Saussure observed in ordinary language.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In Saussure’s view, meaning is linked to a perception of <i>difference</i>, [<i>247</i>] and elements of a system
              are defined by their relation to other elements of that system. We distinguish the
              word <i>tell</i> from the word <i>fell</i> by
              distinguishing the difference between a <i>t</i> and an <i>f</i>. In the same way comedy, the name that we give to a particular
              structure of events on a stage, is discernible as structure only in relation to
              tragedy. Hero could die, but does not; that she does not might be a way of
            classifying <i>Ado</i> as a comedy, except that we know from the
            beginning that she will not die. Such patterns are language patterns rather than
              mimetic actions and we respond to those patterns in the same way in which we respond
              to language. That is to say, we read both the actor and the action as
              we watch them on stage. . . . We place each character and each action according to a
              recognized grammar which is based on predictability; When
            beginning a clause will be followed by a noun or a pronoun.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Predictability . . . seems . . . an essential characteristic both of
              grammatical structure and of genre. Structure in this sense is structure of plot and
              predictability is a predictability of function. At the level of function we always
              know the plot and it is that knowledge that makes it possible for us to watch the
              play. It is within the context of this knowledge of a known convention that we make
              distinctions and that we read. Thus we distinguish <i>The
                Comedy of Errors</i> from <i>Twelfth Night</i> not only by
              noting the different ways in which the protasis (exposition) is handled in both plays,
              but also by observing how in the one, mistaken identity in its simplest sense provides
              the ground of the entire plot, whereas in the other there are many kinds of mistaken
              identity. Nonetheless, we recognize Malvolio as belonging to the same group of
              characters as Antipholus of Ephesus, and I would argue that the beginning of <i>Twelfth Night</i> is like the beginning of <i>The Comedy
                of Errors</i> in much the same way in which <i>John hit the
                ball</i> is like <i>Mary bit the cat</i>. We are not surprised in
              either play that mistakes in identity result in confusions in love.

              initiated a deft parody of language and manoeuvers then employed between the English

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Her first, and repeated, example misstates the locking out of E. Antipholus. (P. 61):
              Suspicious that her husband has been unfaithful, Adriana locks him out of the
              house, an exclusionary tactic that is homologous with the official Elizabethan
              rhetoric against nonconformity. But what happens is that Adriana thinks she
              <i>has</i> her husband, is reconciled with him, and orders S. Dromio
            to keep them from being disturbed (<a href="#tln_0567" class="ref lb">567–615</a>). <a href="#b_hamd1992" class="ref bibl">Hamilton</a>’s argument is that Adriana, who stands both for the
            established church that is keeping nonconformists out and for Queen Elizabeth, whose
            policies the church is following, needs to be encouraged to admit the nonconformists.
            The code Sh. uses involves such matters as (p. 64) his choosing Ephesus because, in the
            polemics of the time, the presbyterians pointed out that it was not clear whether Paul
            left Timothy in Ephesus as bishop, or as minister and evangelist; our understanding that
            the beatings are allegorized as the Dromios (p. 78) literalise the language of
              violence that had become the staple of the puritan and anti-puritan tracts and
              treatises; our knowing that the golden chain represents a <i>catena</i>, a collection of explanations about
            theological matters, usually Roman Catholic but made newly popular in Richard Perkins’s
              <i>A golden chain</i> . . . (1591, Latin 1590); and the audience’s
            remembering (p. 85) that in the preface to the 1583 ed. of <i>Actes and
              Monuments</i>, Foxe used the metaphor of a shipwreck three times in encouraging
            his countrymen to work toward the goal of unity, reuniting the families of conformists
            and nonconformists into the English church.</p>

            of the separate items—chain, shipwreck, exclusion—that combine in the code to urge the
            state to be inclusive in its dealings with the presbyterians, be made clear by
            theatrical means? Is it likely that Sh. assembled all the diffuse elements <a href="#b_hamd1992" class="ref bibl">Hamilton</a> identifies
            into his composition of <i>Err.</i>? Say it was what happened, and
            only a few members of the audience, perhaps all the Gray’s Inn audience, cracked the
            code, surely the town gossip would let the code be known, and some record of the scandal
            (instructing Queen Elizabeth) would have come down to us? And of course there lies the
            last objection—verifiability. Interpretive criticism that illuminates unsuspected
            meanings need not be verified, but when plays are said to be intended to change state
            policy, the critic has the responsibility to show that some one of the contemporary
            audience understood what was being proposed in coded terms.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              To describe the creation, maintenance, and exploitation of the gaps
                that separate the participants’ awarenesses and ours in <i>The Comedy
                  of Errors</i> is almost to describe the entire play, for in his first comedy
                Shakespeare came nearer than ever afterward to placing his whole reliance upon an
                arrangement of discrepant awarenesses. . . . Comic effect emerges not once from
                character as such. If the Dromios prove laughable, it is not in themselves but in
                the incompleteness of their vision of situation that they prove so. . . . [<i>2</i>] With neither character nor language making notable comic
                contribution . . . the great resource of laughter is the exploitable gulf spread
                between the participants’ understanding and ours.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              This gap is held open from beginning to end: it is available for
                exploitation and is exploited during ten of the eleven scenes. In the course of the
                action we hold an advantage of awareness over fifteen of the sixteen persons—Aemilia
                alone never being exhibited on a level beneath ours. . . . 
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The key fact that is quickly revealed to us is denied Aegeon
              and the two sets of twins: they are ignorant that all are in the same
                city.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_evab1960" class="ref bibl">Evans</a>
              explains the effect of this discrepant awareness on <i>Err.</i> and
              how it differs from other plays. He also makes the point that there is no
                practiser (p. 3): No one here wilfully deceives
                another or even passively withholds a secret—for none here knows enough of the
                situation to deceive others about it, and none has a secret to
                withhold. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>7</i>] In these various ways . . . Shakespeare
                worked to make it credible that the participants should continue, throughout the
                bustling action, to be abused by error; that is to say, thus he kept open for his
                uses the exploitable gap from which rise the comic effects.
              Various ways involve keeping action credible, which he does by having
              S. Antipholus fear the sorcery of Ephesus and distrust his sanity and by having
              Adriana focus on her endangered marriage.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">However, his addition of the frame story . . . greatly complicated . . . the
                system of awarenesses which prevails throughout the play. It also profoundly affects
                our view of the farcical scenes. The tragic note of Aegeon’s opening speech
              and the Duke’s pity there, and the remarks of the Merchant to S. Antipholus in 1.2
              should affect us.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>8</i>] If the heavy emphasis given it [i.e.,
                pity] is indicative of intention, Shakespeare meant the painful sound to be carried
                in our memories through all the fun until we meet Aegeon again, on his way to
                execution.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">We are thus obliged to observe the comic action . . . while our
                minds hold a spot of anxiety for Aegeon. This method becomes a
                regular formula.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">But just this once, he withholds not only from the participants <i>but from us also</i> an all-important fact: he hides a
                key. . . . When we learn that there is an Abbess in Ephesus and that this Abbess is
                no other than old Aegeon’s lost wife, the play is within eighty lines of the end.
                Had we been told of her existence at the outset, we would have been
                assured . . . that all would finally be well.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh. (p. 9) has simply deceived us, as he would do again only in <i>WT.</i></p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_broh1961" class="ref bibl">Brooks</a> (1961,
              pp. 55–8): <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> has its large dramatic
                design, but it is no less remarkable for its controlled detail, unparalleled at this
                date, except in <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, outside Shakespeare’s
                other plays. His handling of the lesser units of structure, from the scene
                downwards, is already sure, and indeed within its conventions brilliant. These units
                include the scene, a new one beginning whenever the stage is clear; the sub-scene,
                or <i>scène</i> as understood in French
                drama, a new one beginning whenever the group on stage is altered by anyone leaving
                or joining it; the passage of dialogue or the set speech, more than one, sometimes,
                going to make up the <i>scène</i>; besides
                every physical action, whether procession, brawl, or bit of minor
              business.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He gives a detailed analysis of 1.2. (P. 56): Shakespeare has already
                the art of fulfilling, and with the economy that secures dramatic compression, three
                principal requirements of dramatic structure: retrospect, preparation, and immediate
                interest. By retrospect and preparation the playwright keeps his action moving—the
                great virtue of dynamic or progressive structure—with the strongest continuity.
                Further, while he concerns himself with the matter of the present scene, he can add
                force and meaning to what has gone before, and pile them up for what is to come
                after, so that, in effect, he is building up several (perhaps widely separated)
                parts of his play at once. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              With the first entry and speech of [1.2], there is interest in the
                appearance of three fresh persons, and some tension: Antipholus the alien is warned
                that he is in danger of the fate which overtook Egeon in the scene before; a fate
                summarized in the natural course of the warning. This retrospect, and parallel of
                situation, link the opening of the main action and that of the Egeon action within
                which it is to be framed. The link is strengthened by reference to three themes
                already started in the Egeon episode: risk (and in particular the hazards of
                Ephesus), wealth and time. Egeon, Antipholus is told:  . . . not being able to buy out his life <br/>According to the statute of the
                  town <br/>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west. [<a href="#tln_0167" class="ref lb">167–9</a>] Since these themes
                will be developed throughout the main action, the references to them are preparatory
                no less than retrospective. The theme of moneyed wealth is emphasized by
                stage-business: the merchant hands back to Antipholus  . . . your money that
                  I had to keep, and Antipholus passes it on to Dromio. The bag of money is
                to [<i>57</i>] furnish one of the two subjects of the first comic
                misunderstanding, due to occur later in the scene, and therefore is implanted
                visually on the audience’s mind beforehand; moreover, it will form a parallel with
                the gold chain and the purse, other concrete visible properties which carry on the
                theme and become foci of similar cross-purposes in subsequent Acts. The second
                subject of the imminent misunderstanding, the summons to dinner by the Ephesian
                Dromio, is also prepared, and the time-theme touched, in Antipholus’ observation:
                  Within this hour it will be dinner-time [<a href="#tln_0173" class="ref lb">173</a>]. Another chief theme . . . is introduced when he is
                warned to conceal his Syracusan origin; for this concerns his identity. Again, when
                he bids Dromio depart with his money, Dromio’s exit lines: [quotes <a href="#tln_0179" class="ref lb">179–80</a>] foreshadow
                the suspicion that his master will shortly entertain, while preparing us to
                recognize it as groundless, a comic error. The rendezvous arranged, at the Centaur,
                leads to the reunion of master and servant in II.ii.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              Dromio’s jesting exit ends the first <i>scène</i>. It is Shakespeare’s cue for underlining the promise
                of comedy: the note of tension at the start has now passed into the background. It
                is the cue also for Antipholus’ direct comment upon Dromio’s character, which adds
                to what has been gathered of his own and of the relations between the two of them.
                The audience’s present curiosity about them is gratified, and its appetite whetted,
                both together; for the promise of comedy is contained in the informative comment
                itself: [quotes <a href="#tln_0182" class="ref lb">182–4</a>], jests, it is clear, which are very timely. Antipholus’ experience
                of Dromio as a jester is needed to explain his coming assumption that the invitation
                to dinner is his servant’s joke, and his slowly mounting surprise and anger when it
                is persisted in out of season. The rendezvous with the merchant, at five
                  o’clock, like that arranged in <i>scène</i> I with Dromio, helps to establish the theme of timing, and the
                motifs of timely or untimely meetings or failures to meet. It points forward,
                moreover, to the hour (cp. [<a href="#tln_1587" class="ref lb">1587</a>]) so
                fateful for Egeon, the hour (though we do not [<i>58</i>] yet know
                this) of the <i>dénouement</i>; somewhat as
                the mention of dinnertime in <i>scène</i> I
                began to make ready for the dinner episode (III. i), the play’s central
                pivot.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              The <i>scènes</i> of three,
                then two persons, are succeeded by Antipholus’ first soliloquy. Here and in the two
                remaining <i>scènes</i>, the immediate
                interest for the audience strengthens. From the point of view of comedy and the
                intrigue, <i>scène</i> 4, the encounter with
                the wrong Dromio, is the climax of the whole scene. It is flanked, in the ABA form
                so frequent in Shakespeare, by Antipholus’ soliloquies, which are the imaginative
                climaxes, and, together with the moment when he strikes (the Ephesian) Dromio, the
                emotional climaxes too, though there is contrast between his emotion as an
                exasperated and as a melancholy imaginative man. From the
                imaginative, introspective man he is, soliloquies (his brother has none) come
                naturally; his allusion to his care and melancholy has prepared the
                way for them.

              pp. 106–7): The primary reason for this speech [<a href="#tln_1310" class="ref lb">1310–20</a>] is not to rouse sympathy
                for the servant, though this is a secondary reason, and relevant to the context. The
                primary reason . . . is structural. The structure of <i><i>[</i>The<i>]</i> Comedy of Errors</i> is a
                metamorphosis structure, a descent into illusion and an emer­[<i>107</i>]gence into recognition. The main action takes place in a world of
                illusion and assumed madness; the imagery of the final recognition scene suggests a
                passing through death into a new world. Not only is Aegeon delivered from death at
                the very moment of his execution, but the Ephesus twins are imprisoned in a
                  dark and dankish vault [<a href="#tln_1724" class="ref lb">1724</a>],
                by a living dead man [<a href="#tln_1718" class="ref lb">1718</a>] with no face. They escape by gnawing through their bonds, and the
                symbolism of this is at once pounced on by Dromio of Ephesus: [quotes <a href="#tln_1768" class="ref lb">1768–70</a>]. The Duke’s
                remark, I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup [<a href="#tln_1747" class="ref lb">1747</a>], and his comment when the twins meet, One of
                  these men is Genius of the other [<a href="#tln_1817" class="ref lb">1817</a>], fill out the same metamorphosis pattern.</p>

              pp. 104 ff.) explores how the delayed identification of the Abbess as the one who can
              clear up all the remaining mysteries affects the play (p. 105): The very fact
                that the Abbess is a new character appearing at what is obviously a very late stage
                in the play arouses the audience’s expectations. Antipholus and Dromio of Ephesus
                are on-stage already. The Abbess brings with her their Syracusian counterparts, so
                the pairs of twins are seen together for the first time. Obviously a solution is
                imminent; but we do not know how it is to be brought about. For a moment confusion
                seems worse confounded. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me
                  [<a href="#tln_1816" class="ref lb">1816</a>], says Adriana. Antipholus of
                Syracuse recognises his father; but the next (and major) recognition comes
                unexpectedly from the one character we know nothing about. The Abbess recognises
                Egeon as her husband, and thus reveals herself as the mother of one pair of twins.
                The implications of the revelation are unfolded in an episode of some length,
                allowing the audience to recover from its surprise (which may cause laughter) and to
                share in the different reactions of the characters as they readjust themselves to
                the happily changed situation.

              (1974, pp. 481–4): <i>Err.</i>
              needs to be studied for the way it employs the structural pattern of
                separation and union—a pattern that . . . informs the language, characterization,
                and action of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> in a way that has not
                been explored in the past. . . . Separation is represented by references to, and
                acts of, severing, untying, releasing, divorcing, freeing, and losing; these are
                balanced by different representations of union: binding, tying, fastening, uniting,
                confining, and finding. . . . Separation . . . becomes associated . . . with
                categories such as illogicality, chaos, and domestic dissolution; whereas union is
                linked with logic, order, and domestic stability. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              The play’s solid base [is] made up of four interlocking levels of
                reality: family, commerce, state, and cosmos. The last of these does not have as
                prominent a role as do the first three; nevertheless, it <i>is</i>
                present. . . . The social situation (commerce and state) is not [as?] central to
                the play’s meaning as is the domestic. . . . The principal search is for the
                natural bonds that hold a family together as well as a search for individual members
                of that family. In a more general way all four levels are marked by a drive toward
                overcoming [<i>482</i>] estrangement or division.

              begins by noting that Egeon, entering bound and reentering bound in Act 5, becomes (p.
              483) an emblem for the idea of confinement, especially as it applies
                to the level of state. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              At the level of commerce the word bond is obviously
                significant. But . . . the word also suggests binding, arresting, or pulling
                together toward union. All of these suggestions are supported by two symbolic
                objects: the controversial gold chain . . . and the rope.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He furnishes an example (p. 484): State, commerce, and family are all part of
                the action in Act IV, Scene 4. Here are an arresting Officer (representing the order
                of state), the Courtesan (representing her particular brand of commercial
                interests), and two sisters. . . . The Officer has Antipholus of Ephesus
                figuratively bound by legal arrest, Dromio of Ephesus comes in with the by now
                ridiculous rope, and the three women . . . bring in Dr. Pinch . . . to separate
                Antipholus from the devil. If binding and separating were ever made farcical, here
                it is as robustly done as could be imagined. . . . The Ephesian Antipholus and
                Dromio were bound to their domestic responsibilities when we first saw them; now
                they are literally bound by the state and by Pinch’s would-be assistants in the
                absurd exorcism, which includes literal binding.</p>

                order.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Everything comes in pairs. He counts (p. 47) some eighteen principal
                errors scattered through the nine scenes [1.1 and 5.1 excluded], and these come at
                intervals that are spaced with remarkable evenness. There are three distinct sets of
                properties identifying each set of twins—six properties in all. . . . Evenly spaced
                speeches [recapitulate] what has just transpired, designed to keep everything clear
                to the . . . audience, who must never be permitted to share the confusions of the
                participants. The few scenes that border on romantic love (between Antipholus of
                Syracuse and Luciana) are followed hard by mock-romantic scenes or lines to provide
                the kind of symmetrical contrast that Shakespeare will use
              [later]. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>48</i>] <i>Rime</i> and <i>meter</i> are surely the most obvious components of linguistic
                symmetry. One-fifth of this play’s lines rime—a proportion exceeded in only three of
                all the rest of Shakespeare’s plays. . . . Patterns of alternating rime, as well as
                the more familiar riming couplets, appear, illustrating two kinds of
                symmetry.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In addition to these <i>sound</i> effects, symmetry
                appears in the <i>sense</i> of the language as well. The <i>pun</i>, which is by definition a wedding of sound and sense in
                symmetrical pattern, is everywhere in this play. He adds question and
              answer, pro and con arguments, cause-and-effect statements, the cheerful and
                primitive pastime of name calling, and vituperation, all without
              illustration.</p>

              (1981), opposing structuralist analysis based on binary differentiation, asks what it
              is about identical twins that makes them so popular in the theater and indeed in the
              myths that lie behind theater. (P. 69): In <i>The Comedy of
                  Errors</i>, and more generally in all comedies of twins, the characters deal
                with each other on the assumption that all of them are unique and immediately
                identifiable as such. If they did not cling to this assumption in the face of
                contrary evidence they would not become so confused. It takes more than the presence
                of undistinguishable twins . . . to generate the comic effects; it takes this
                persistent refusal to acknowledge the possibility of beings, human or divine,
                [being] less different from each other than we would like them to be.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Paradoxically, he says, while characters—he is generalizing about comedies and
              tragedies—act on the basis of differences, they really are trying to imitate each
              other until they become xerox copies (p. 70) of each other, as the
              twins are in <i>Err.</i></p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 75): Too much presumption of difference, too much appetite for
                difference precipitates the loss of whatever difference there was in the first
                place, with consequences that can be comic or tragic according to the manner in
                which they are treated. The perpetual disappointment of expectations alienates the
                characters from each other and even from themselves.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              The moment comes when the characters undergo a breakdown of personal
                identity. Then, any one of them can exclaim, Am I myself, are the others
                  themselves? In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> this moment
                occurs at the same critical point as in the other plays. Dromio asks his master,
                  Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio, Am I your man, Am I myself? [<a href="#tln_0864" class="ref lb">864–5</a>]. . . . 
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>77</i>] Ultimately, undifferentiation spreads to
                the entire city. Twins and non-twins alike are turned loose into the streets
                screaming and fighting insanely. Then comes the recognition scene, just in time to
                avoid a real disaster.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Finally (p. 85), The extreme frequency of twins in most mythologies does not
                go without saying. It calls for some explanation. When a myth resorts to twins, it
                must be trying to make a point and this point cannot be the difference between the
                twins, otherwise why resort to twins? The point is obviously the absence of
                difference. <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is more fun than
                structuralism.</p>

              to show that the dialectic of nature and custom variously repeated in

                into the play that is true to its textual and theatrical possibilities, and provides
                yet another hint of the integrity and continuity of Shakespeare’s imaginative
                vision. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>152</i>] The mainspring of the comic action is a
                conflict between what is customary (or . . . conventional) and what is
                natural, where nature is Hooker’s that manner of working which God
                hath set for each created thing to keepe.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_gree1980" class="ref bibl">Grennan</a> gives
              examples: the law that condemns Egeon is (custom [<i>153</i>]
                carried to its dogmatic extremity), and the natural sympathy evoked by the pathetic
                figure of the condemned old man; the overtly civil conversation
                between Antipholus of Syracuse and the First Merchant in 1.2 marked
                by the mannerly tone of polite social gesture (I crave your pardon,
                please you,
                Sir, I commend you to your own content ([<a href="#tln_0189" class="ref lb">189–95</a>]). Left alone, however,
                Antipholus utters a speech that unravels the tightly woven fabric of this secure
                social world, replacing its fixity, its confident conventional identity with his own
                mysterious sensation of non-being: [quotes <a href="#tln_0199" class="ref lb">199–202</a>]. Such undermining of the customary world
                continues to the end of the scene. Dromio’s breathless language and behavior must
                seem to Antipholus to be anarchic, natural. They erode the
                conventional master-slave relationship.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">And so on for most of the play: Adriana’s misery is natural, Luciana’s response
              conventional, E. Antipholus’s violence at being locked out is natural, Angelo’s
              response conventional.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">As to language, it (p. 156) mirrors [the] action, offering its own equivalent
                of the structural pattern. Even a superficial reading . . . immediately reveals how
                conventional its linguistic and poetic elements are. Egeon’s opening speech
              is a (p. 157) conventional <i>narratio</i>, grounded in Aeneas’s account to Dido, its blank verse
              is regular.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 158): Common to all these uses of language is an assumption that the forms
                employed and the statements made will immediately and in the way intended by the
                speakers be decipherable by the listeners. Even when the speakers are at odds with
                one another they use the language in essentially the same way. Both formally and
                substantively, therefore, language in such cases is being used according to custom
                and according to conventional shared beliefs about its secure relationship with
                non-linguistic reality—the world to which it refers.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">However, at every turn we see the orderliness of conventional verbal
                forms sabotaged by the linguistic anarchy of the pun. For while the formal presence
                of the pun is a conventional comic device, its actual function within the fictional
                world is a reminder of the natural ambivalence inherent in experience. . . . The
                conflict between conventional uses of language and the pun re-enacts in linguistic
                terms the dialectical relationship of custom and nature observable in the
                action. . . . </p>

                Abbess . . . the dialectic of custom and nature in the language and the

              figure of authority by the characters, who cluster around her silently. In
                questioning Adriana about her husband . . . she shows rich insight and an openness
                to natural feelings: [quotes <a href="#tln_1516" class="ref lb">1516–21</a>]. Her tone throughout is humane and
                understanding; her authority, like her [<i>161</i>] verse, is
                flexible in natural ways. Sin, the customary way of looking at Antipholus’s behavior
                  (possession in Pinch’s terminology), is mitigated by a sorrow that
                speaks of her concern for a human being. In the same way her rebuke of Adriana’s
                jealousy is not the reduction of a living woman to a conventional caricature (like
                her Plautine original, and as Luciana and Antipholus of Ephesus see her), but an
                accurate assessment of the pragmatic particulars. . . . As the sequence progresses
                we see that the Abbess combines unaffectedly the qualities of custom and
                nature by refusing Adriana’s conventional wifely desire to take care of her
              husband, insisting on her religious duty to intervene to make the man

              onstage. Thus, at the height of the confusion, the solution—that is, a
                face-to-face encounter between the twins—seems closer than it ever has. But
              there was an even closer one. At the beginning of Act III, scene ii,
                the Syracusan Antipholus enters with Luciana just after his Ephesian twin
                left . . . to end the previous scene; no time has elapsed, and no change of
                location has occurred. While thirteen lines separate the exit of one brother from
                the entrance of the other in Act IV, scene iv, no lines intervene here. In actual
                clock time the Antipholi miss each other [in 3.2] by only a second or less, while
                about half a minute must separate them in the later case. Yet I am sure that the
                audience’s sense that the brothers nearly ran into one another is much stronger in
                the next-to-last scene than at the beginning of Act III, scene ii. It is our
                automatic tendency to compartmentalize two scenes, rather than the conscious
                deduction that such an encounter could not occur at the earlier point, that is the
                key to this difference in our responses to the two incidents. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Whereas Plautus’s beginning and ending are alike in tone—The absurd happy
                ending is implicit in the absurd data of the start, Sh.’s dark beginning
                makes us aware . . . of a repeated pattern of separation, search, and return
                that links the exposition of past events with the action of the play proper and thus
                adds a color of necessity or at least probability to the discoveries of the final
                  scene. . . . [<i>115</i>] This trick of exposition makes of the
                play’s beginning the end of a catastrophic cycle that the ensuing action imitates in
                a farcical manner, penetrates with analogical threads of seriousness, and completes
                happily. The pathetic, slow-paced search of father for sons and brother for brother
                is continued as the increasingly hectic chase across the stage of the characters
                fleeing from or searching for each other. [Quotes <a href="#tln_0862" class="ref lb">862–7</a>]. The narrated history of the
                loving family split up by the storms of fortune is acted out from a new perspective

                faithlessness . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_0514" class="ref lb">514–18</a>]. Such correspondences between pathetic

              (1997, pp. 356–7): It is impossible to talk about <i>The
                  Comedy of Errors</i> without invoking duality, polarity, antithesis,
                symbiosis, fusion, binary oppositions. Shakespeare combines Pauline and Plautine
                sources, mixing one of antiquity’s most spiritual writers with one of its most
                salacious. He gives us two kinds of supernatural power, the prestidigitatory
                exorcisms of Dr. Pinch and the holistic religion of the Abbess. He explores two
                kinds of personality loss, the negative in the fragmentation caused by grief, the
                positive in the sublimation of love. Lodgings are characterised by division and
                duality: the Centaur (half man, half beast) and the Phoenix (death and rebirth).
                There are two lock-out scenes, one each for husband (Antipholus of Ephesus) and
                wife. Emendations by Hanmer and Johnson notwithstanding, the play ends most
                fittingly, as it began, with a double birth [quotes <a href="#tln_1894" class="ref lb">1894–6</a>]. Who deciphers
                  them? [<a href="#tln_1819" class="ref lb">1819</a>] asks the Duke of
                the two Antipholi, adopting a verb from reading practice, the compare-and-contrast
                exercise of the interpretive critic, the collation work of the editor. The
                characters come only belatedly to a critical mode forced upon the audience from the

              (1939–40, pp. 96–7): I think that in sheer composition this drama
                surpasses most of his early works and some of his mature ones. It testifies that
                this poet . . . set his heart at the outset upon achieving wholeness of
                form. . . . Compared with [<i>Bartholomew Fair</i>] <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, by a young and
                  non-classical writer, is a beautifully carved
              gem. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>97</i>] Obviously he was free from the pedantic
                notion that this device [unity of time and place] is an essential principle of
                drama. But he saw that the outward sort of unity, observed strictly or
                approximately, could be an aid to inward form. And he saw that a strict observance
                was demanded by the material and mood of <i>The Comedy of
                  Errors</i>. [Unified structure fits the whole emotional pattern of the play.]
                An initial mood of swift and strange, almost weird, romance is saturated, as the
                play proceeds with fun that is swift, strange, weird. Thus the romance and the fun
                are congruent.</p>

                the place single and the time that of one day, and it was indeed a good thing that
                he did so. The audience’s readiness to accept the action depends largely on the
                restriction of time: on a second day of wandering in Ephesus, the twins—particularly
                Antipholus of Syracuse, who is after all seeking his brother—would have solved the
                problem on their own, by deduction or by a simple encounter. For the space of a few
                hours we can accept that they might not actually meet, might not have time to think.
                And, if the play was to be primarily concerned with a series of mistakes, the
                dramatist must be able to give room for them . . . : consequently, the action must
                be in a single town for at least the greater part of the play. Shakespeare achieves
                neatness and a sense of continuous speed by locating the whole of it

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Many if not most commentators have something to say about the Egeon-Æmilia romance
              narrative that frames <i>Err.</i> See n. <a href="#cn_0035a" class="ref note_cn">35–142</a>. The following are special studies devoted to the
              frame.</p>

              the frame story: 1. The frame . . . substitutes [for Plautus’s
                Prologue] an organic exposition in dramatic dialogue within the play proper. And
                this exposition is strongly motivated. By command of the Duke, the father, in peril
                of his life, relates the story of his sons and the cause of his own wanderings. The
                scene ends effectively, with sentence imposed but temporarily suspended.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>629</i>] 2. The frame is here an effective device
                for promoting plot unity. Without it the internal plot . . . impresses one as a
                rather loosely knit series of comic happenings. The frame gives a firm beginning and
                a firm, definite, and massive ending. That this is somewhat contrasted in tone with
                the misadventures that form the main plot merely, from this point of view, increases
                its effectiveness.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              3. By its tone of romantic tragicomedy the frame also combines with
                other elements . . . to lift the Plautan farce into an atmosphere of greater
                dignity.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              4. The frame increases the general happiness of the ending. Among the
                many points which it adjusts we may note the reunion of the Antipholuses, the curing
                of Adriana’s jealousy, the clearing up of the triangle situation between the two
                Dromios and Luce, the pairing off of Luciana with Antipholus of Syracuse, the
                release of the father from his imprisonment, and the reunion of the mother with her
                two sons and her husband.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">5. The effectiveness of the conclusion is enhanced by
                surprise by the appearance of the Abbess.</p>

                need not be: its context is one of trial, judgment, and sentencing, wherein the
                victim must be granted our indulgence. Egeon’s role . . . is created to give a
                tragic [<i>13</i>] overcast to the comic business of mistaken
                identity. . . . Shakespeare’s own stamp and the taste of his audience account for
                this somber beginning, as well as for the mixing of mirth and melancholy in the play
                proper.</p>

                be necessary for other reasons, not immediately perceived if we use only the

                this short play: his presence obviously a framework of poignancy and standard of
                misfortune standing in contrast to the [?]advented absurdities of the twins’
                story.

                and ending, and with one enframing the other. The enframing actions are recognizable
                as common to the world we leave behind when we enter the theater to be free for a
                time of its claims. . . . The enframed actions on the other hand, are playful and
                even farcical and are set in places where the laws of verisimilitude and

                result of Shakespeare’s enframing the ludic within the mimetic, serves the purpose
                of the other. Once underway, the interval of mirth and game
                completely engages the audience’s attention until the errors out of which it
                develops have been discovered. For this ludic interval of escape from [<i>43</i>] the world of everyday the story of Egeon serves simply as a
                frame or transitional fiction. Once the Egeon story comes full circle
                in the final reunion scene, the relationship between the two is reversed. Now the
                merry tale of mistaken identities is not only subordinate; when viewed from the
                perspective established by the reunions scene, it actually serves the purpose of the
                exemplary tale of loss and recovery by serving as a parodic opposite for the
                  perfect pattern that is figured forth in the
                reunion. It is hard to know whom he is quoting; not <i>Err.</i></p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The ludic plot always fulfills its purpose as a diverting recreation. The
                other comedy is conceptual. It requires . . . wonder and reflection. Reflection
                leads, finally, to a recognition of the recreational value of Egeon’s
                reunion with his wife and sons. A father, assured of heirs, no longer despairs. His
                sons in being reborn have regained fully their identities and are
                ready, in turn—one through an impending marriage, the other through a marriage
                restored to harmony—to participate in the communal life of Ephesus and
                Syracuse.</p>

          





          
            <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Five-Act Structure</h4>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">One issue about structure is that of the so-called five-act structure, that is,
              whether <i>Err.</i>, like other public playhouse plays before about
              1606, was written according to the neoclassic analysis of Terence’s plays, was
              numbered by the author or some other person, and was acted with pauses or
              continuously. The most recent review is <a href="#b_tayg1993" class="ref bibl">Taylor &amp; Jowett</a>
              (1993).</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#pw_balt1928" class="ref bibl_pw">Baldwin</a>
              (ed. 1928, pp. xxvi ff.) had not yet articulated what he came to call the Terentian
              formula, but he analyzes the plot firmly in terms of acts. He summarizes the plot of
              Acts 1 and 2, showing how they set up the frame story and the first errors. Then (p.
              xxviii): This third act is the heart of the play, with all the preceding action
                preparing for it, and all the succeeding action flowing from it. This is the regular
                situation in one of Shakespeare’s plays, since it is here that he places the turning
                point in his action. He probably means all of Sh.’s
              plays.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. xxix): Since . . . the central idea is a series of errors leading to
                eventual recognition, then we must have the first narrowly avoided recognition in
                the third act. Incidentally, a second narrowly avoided one occurs in the fourth act
                [4.4, characteristically not identified here or when he gives the plot summary for
                4.4], and the recognition in the fifth, this idea and theory forming the backbone of
                the play. But the error thread is only the main one; the others must
                also be treated in the same way. The third act is thus the place to begin the love
                of Antipholus of Syracuse for Luciana, which seems hopeless in the fourth, but ends
                successfully in the fifth. Conversely, the third act is the place to bring the
                forces opposed to the predetermined ending to their highest point. Thus we have the
                break of Antipholus of Ephesus with . . . Adriana appearing in the third act.
                Naturally, then, we have Adriana’s side of the break emphasized in the fourth act,
                and the reconciliation in the fifth. Also, Antipholus of Syracuse here decides to
                leave Ephesus, a decision that must not be put into effect if the story is to end
                properly. . . . Thus with the given materials Shakespeare’s theory of construction
                naturally determined what should be placed in the third act. Indirectly, it also
                determined what should be in the first and second, since they must prepare for the
                third. It is not easy to judge whether this mechanical process, laid forth
              so repetitiously, was the result of <a href="#pw_balt1928" class="ref bibl_pw">Baldwin</a>’s writing a school text, or whether it came
              from his regular style, to be seen in book after book.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Idem</a> (1947,
              pp. 315, 579, 682–3, 703, 706–14) restricts his interest to the first point above,
              demonstrating with great erudition that Sh. learned to construct his plays on a
              five-act structure taught in the humanist commentaries on Terence that formed part of
              the grammar school curriculum of the day. I quote him at length because he spent so
              much of his career on <i>Err.</i> and because summary is nearly
              impossible. Specifically, this structure, which he calls the Terentian
                formula, consists of the protasis, or introduction, usually
              the first two acts; the epitasis,
              the most busie parte of a comedie (<a href="#b_coot1565" class="ref bibl">Cooper</a>, 1565), again usually two
              acts; and the catastrophe, the resolution in the final act. <a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> shows
              beyond any doubt that these terms were taught to, alluded to and recognized by at
              least the boys who learned Terence when they were about nine years old.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Before turning to Terence, on pp. 682–3, writing about the influence of the biblical
                Acts 19 as a source that caused Sh. to set <i>Err.</i> in Ephesus, <a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> observes that each of the first four acts ends with S.
              Antipholus becoming increasingly determined to escape the witchcraft he thinks is
              being exerted on him. (Here Baldwin does not insist that these repetitions mark a
              five-act structure; he does insist on this in <i>Genetics</i>, 1965,
              pp. 73–87, however.)</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 579): It appears probable that Shakspere had the conventional drill on
                Terence in grammar school, and that this drill would include some knowledge of the
                current five-act formula for the plays of Terence. When later Shakspere himself
                wrote plays, did he use any form of this five-act theory? I propose now to examine
                from this point of view the structure of three of Shakspere’s early comedies [<i>LLL</i>, <i>Err.</i>, <i>TGV</i>]. I believe that approximately in their original form structurally
                these are Shakspere’s three earliest surviving comedies, and that they were written,
                as their structure itself will show, in the order given above.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It is not <a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a>’s way to move by straightforward exposition. He argues that
                <i>LLL</i> was written first because it is a too-mechanical
              following of Terentian three-part structure and of the highly symmetrical pairings of
              Lyly’s <i>Endimion</i>.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 703): But it will be noticed also that the shaping influence upon
                the structure of <i>The Comedy</i> was the five-act formula. The
                particular variety used here . . . finds its first printed statement . . . in an
                edition of Terence without date but known to have been printed in 1550. The edition
                and the ideas are really those of Iodocus Willichius, but it is his pupil Gregorius
                Wagnerus who in his preface . . . phrases the formula with application to <i>Andria</i>. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>706</i>] &lt;I, 1&gt; The first scene is merely a
                prologue to give the setting for the play and to prepare for the reunited family at
                the end of the fifth act. [<i>707</i>] Father Aegeon is chosen to be
                the prologue and comes very near to being that constantly defined thing in Terentian
                criticism a <i>protactica persona</i>, since
                he is dismissed till the catastrophe. He summarizes the scene.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Sh. is following Terence’s <i>Andria</i>, with its commentary by
              Willichius. This structure is pointedly Terentian. Contemporaries
                would have considered that Shakspere had carefully observed Terentian structure
                here.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">&lt;I,2&gt; The play proper now begins with the arrival of Antipholus
                of Syracuse in search of his mother and brother—though no [<i>708</i>] one seems to have been much interested in mother, and mother appears to
                have reciprocated; in other words, mother has not been worked into the main story
                either; the play has been merely fringed with romance, the romance has not been
                woven in. He summarizes the content.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It will be seen that Shakspere has discarded the first act of <i>Menaechmi</i> and has developed ideas from the first two scenes of the second
                act into his first act. This mixing of the Terentian formula with the
              manipulating of <i>Menaechmi</i> continues.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Having analyzed 3.1 (p. 710): The issue is now joined. Some
                explanation must now eventually be forthcoming, though the first approach to
                recognition has failed. Here is the beginning of the epitasis exactly at its
                hallowed place, the beginning of the third act.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              With the epitasis begun, our next major objective is the end of the
                fourth act, for at its end must be prepared the remedy for the great ills, so that
                this remedy may be administered in the catastrophe of the fifth act. . . . 
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              We must now begin to work toward this formula-determined objective of
                the third act.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Having analyzed each scene in this fashion, he concludes (p. 713), I suppose
                the reader will need no further demonstration from me to be convinced that Shakspere
                has very pointedly and exactly shaped this comedy on the <i>Andria</i> formula.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">What he skips over is the stage direction at <a href="#tln_1473" class="ref lb">1473</a>, nine lines into Act 5: <i>Enter Antipholus and Dromio
                againe</i>, where the <i>againe</i> is normally taken to be Sh.’s
              indication that the action is continuous rather than broken by the <i>Actus Quintus</i> heading; but see <a href="#b_tayg1993" class="ref bibl">Taylor &amp; Jowett</a>, 1993, p. 45
              n.: But Antipholus and Dromio could never have been onstage for the first 8 ll.
                of the scene, and in an authorial MS the <i>againe</i> probably indicates continuous writing rather than continuous
                performance.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Err.</i>’s structure, <a href="#b_balt1947" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> continues, is pure Terence, even pure
              Terence of the <i>Andria</i>, though based on Plautus’s <i>Menaechmi</i> with the insertion of the shut-out scene that lies at
              the heart of the <i>Amphitruo</i>. Here is the best, most expert
              example of a play built on a structural formula (p. 714): It may not be
                amiss . . . to point out why <i>The Comedy</i> appears to be so
                much more mature a play in its structure than many of those which followed it. The
                reason is that Shakspere is here working in a well-understood type, according to
                rules which had already been long since clearly formulated and taught.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_chae1930" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a>
              (1930, 1:307): The stage-direction ([<a href="#tln_1473" class="ref lb">1473</a>]), Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe suggests that the
                action was continuous throughout and the F division into acts uncalled for, since
                these characters left the stage at the end of Act iv.</p>

              p. 201): An unoriginal division into acts only has been introduced, perhaps at
                the time of printing, since the unusual direction at [<a href="#tln_1473" class="ref lb">1473</a>], Enter Antipholus and Dromio againe,
                after their exit at the end of Act IV, shows that the action was meant to be
                continuous.</p>

              pp. 69–70): So far as the plot is concerned, this organization corresponds, T.
                W. Baldwin has shown, to the five-act structure Renaissance and earlier critics
                found in Terence; particularly the form found in the <i>Andria</i>. How far it depends upon neo-classical theory is perhaps a question:
                among the features Baldwin indicates, those of most consequence for dramatic effect
                can be paralleled in a mediaeval drama like <i>The Castle of
                  Perseverance</i>, and to a playwright well-endowed with structural sense might
                seem natural, theory or no theory, in plays with a central crisis and a final
                solution. However this may be, the comedy begins <i>in medias res</i>, with the partial exposition of what has
                happened already, and the immediate occasions of the subsidiary and main actions:
                the suspended sentence on Egeon and the summons to the wrong Antipholus. Act II
                completes the exposition and <i>protasis</i>
                by introducing the sisters and their motivation, especially Adriana’s; and ends,
                when the [<i>70</i>] same Antipholus accedes to her summons, with
                the beginning of the <i>epitasis</i> or
                entanglement proper. This leads to the central crisis in III. i: locked out, the
                husband is brought into the entanglement, and narrowly fails to meet his twin:
                despite the Dromios’ scolding-match, recognition is missed. By the last words of Act
                IV, with the firm resolve of the alien to depart, there is imminent danger it will
                be missed for ever; and there follows in the supposed madness of the twins and the
                expiration of Egeon’s respite, the climax of distresses that precipitates the
                  <i>dénouement</i>. There, meeting and
                recognition are combined with the completion and correction of Egeon’s retrospect:

              (1965, p. 922) is doubtful that Sh. was much impressed by Horace’s demand for
                five acts, rehearsing the mixed evidence from choruses in <i>Rom.</i> and the induction in <i>Shr.</i>: All this
                does not suggest any very enthusiastic adherence to the doctrine of five acts,
                though neither does it point to open disregard of it. It is when we come to the
                details of Shakespeare’s structure that we see that the classical models can
                scarcely have taught him very much. He compares <i>Menaechmi</i>’s late developing structure with Sh.’s early one as an example of
              Sh.’s independent control of complicated plotting.</p>

              pp. 1–10): Out of his Renaissance Roman and Renaissance romance
                materials Shakespeare wrought a form of comedy unmistakably his own. It is the
                function of two inconstant variables: the Donatan formula for comic plots, which
                serves as model for a multitude of variations; and the battle of the sexes which
                constitutes the underlying motivation of his variegated romantic-courtship stories.
                The formula was derived by the fourth century grammarian Donatus from his study of
                Terence and ceaselessly re­[<i>2</i>]peated. . . . Comedy, the formula runs, ought
                  indeed to be five-parted, the first which unfolds the argument . . .  (in
                another version: contains either the peril, the anguish or some
                  trouble); the second completes the same. The third has the

                  perturbations, and the impediments and despair of the desired thing);
                  the fourth seeks a medicine for the turbations (or: brings a
                  remedy for the impending evil) and is a preparation for the

                they bargained for, and this on account of a series of fortunate coincidences and
                discoveries . . . the lucky chances of which, in our precarious existences, we are

              These stratagems of the New Comedy supplied Europe with its comic
                fictions for two millennia. . . . They . . . provided Shakespeare with his plots

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>4</i>] In the early <i>Comedy of
                  Errors</i> just such a Menandrine narrative of separation and reunion encases
                the brisk Plautine mistakings and unmaskings of the <i>Menaechmi</i>; and this has tempted criticism to become preoccupied with the
                question whether the meandering romance narrative of marvelous reunions (<i>Apollonius of Tyre</i>, for instance) or the tight Roman structure
                of mistakes and [<i>5</i>] unravellings took precedence in
                Shakespeare’s imagination. The fact of the matter is that both were contained in
                Plautus, and the historical bifurcation into medieval romances on the one hand and
                dramas of intrigue on the other is largely a matter of theatrical convenience. The
                plays foreground the tangle of errors; the romances—they have the time to do
                so—foreground the precedent vicissitudes. . . . However, in application to
                Shakespeare, a further parameter comes into play.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              After the initial sally of <i>The Comedy of

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>6</i>] The telos of Shakespeare’s early comic
                plots then is recovery: the finding of what was missing or lacking at the start. And
                here the first great novelty is at once apparent—Shakespeare’s protagonists do not
                know what they want, except in the most superficial sense. They discover as they go
                along, and so transform the rather arid Donatan scheme into a heuristic device of
                immense potency and flexibility. When his protagonists, like the Romans in their
                happy ends, get more than they bargained for, it is not simply a bonus (admittedly
                considerable) of a son’s light of love turning out to be respectable . . . but an
                illumination of their entire lives. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              Whatever the predicament sets forth as missing at the start, be it a
                twin . . . it will be found. The plot’s formal coherence depends on this, and so
                does the audience’s perception of the play’s coherence. Since . . . the
                protagonists are themselves seekers, and only partly, or not at all cognizant of
                what they seek, the formal development is a continual, unfolding process of
                disclosure, during which, however, the protagonist and the audience are proceeding
                at different rates, that of the protagonist being positively retarded by tumults and
                confusions on the way, that of the audience proceeding apace by inferences and
                hypotheses.
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              Therefore, when the plot is finally resolved by some appropriate
                recognition which enables the objectives to be attained, the <i>anagnorisis</i> is retrospective as well
                as immediate for the protagonist and holistic or integrative for the audience. The
                recognition invites in effect a second order or interpretative, re-evaluative
                reading of events for both. . . . Scales fall from the protagonists’
                eyes. . . . The manifest purposes, desires, goals and motivations of the
                protagonists reveal their inner, previously concealed, or veiled, or latent
                implications.

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In New Comedy the trickster slave is the author of the plot intrigue. (P. 9): In Shakespeare trickery has gone up in the world [no longer dependent on
                the utilitarian tricksters]. . . . The freeing of the comic device . . . has great
                advantages for variety and flexibility. In <i>The Comedy of
                  Errors</i> the comic device is nature’s own—the freakish identicalness of
                twins—but thereafter we have psychological one-upmanship [<i>Wiv.</i>, etc.]. . . . </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The comic device meshes in marvellously intricate, varied and
                eye-opening ways with the comic disposition of human beings to be deluded, deceived,
                mistaken, unreasonable, perverse, irrational and subject to every kind of folly.
                This produces what the neoclassical theorists of the Renaissance, following Donatus,
                called the <i>incrementum processusque
                  turbarum</i>, the increase and procession of perturbations, or the
                  forward progress of the turmoils. The device then exhausts itself,
              no more can be done with it, and remedies take over.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 10): But as they [the remedies] close the gap opened by the play’s
                beginning, they provide the audience with means for a full and final retrospective
                intelligence of the nature, in all its inwardness, of the desirable, the
                pleasurable, the good, the absence of which motivated the story. Because she
              extends the New Comedy pattern to all ten early comedies, her conclusions are richer
              for the whole series than for <i>Err.</i>, which she locates
              first.</p>

                Rosador</a> (1984, pp. 13–17) studies the plotting from an Aristotelian and
              Terentian point of view, denying that plot is a negligible aspect, less regarded than
              structure, theme, and character: Neither for Aristotle nor for the Terentian
                theorists from Donatus to Scaliger is the meaning of plot confined to a rational
                ordering of subject-matter. All of them conceive of plot as having—and this is the
                basic assumption of this essay—a thematic dimension and an inexorable movement
                forward. The latter is inherent in the [<i>14</i>] axiom of
                necessary sequence, in . . . the dictum that a play must have a beginning, a
                middle, and an end. . . . [<i>Turbae</i>,
                the complications of the plot, are to begin as early as the <i>protasis</i>.] Thus the <i>protasis</i> is not only intended to impart introductory information about
                the play’s setting and characters but also has to awaken the audience’s
                expectations. Even retrospection . . . must make the spectator look ahead; not only
                the end of the play but also the movement towards it must be contained within the
                beginning. . . . [The dramatist must master the art of] precipitation, of preparing
                a concerted forward movement.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He analyzes Egeon’s opening speech to find in the references to a lost family that
              will certainly be found again the necessary expectation, comic precipitation.</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 15): But it is above all the plotting of Egeon’s life-story and of the
                first scene which by indirection ensures the audience that what they are watching is
                a comedy and which pitches their minds forward to a comic conclusion. Moreover, this
                is a kind of plotting which informs the rest of the play as well. The life of Egeon
                and his family from the moment they embark is patterned on a variant of the approved
                romance model of never-ceasing reversals from happiness to unhappiness to happiness.
                It consists of a plot-movement which, again and again, builds up dangers,
                unendurable suffering or mortal peril, only to bypass irrevocable consequences at
                the last possible moment. He recounts that movement in Egeon’s speech. Some
              later examples:</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
              The money Antipholus of Syracuse thinks lost soon turns up again (2.1 and 2.2);
                Antipholus of Ephesus eventually listens to advice and does not break into his own
                house by main force (3.1); Dromio of Syracuse escapes the claims of the monstrously
                spherical kitchen-wench, as does his master the siren-like enchantments of Luciana
                (3.2).
            </p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He finds another pattern, an oscillation (p. 16) between . . . accelerando
                and ritardando. In 1.2 and 2.1 the easy introduction of stereotyped
                figures and the quiet unfolding of relevant themes are abruptly brought to an end
                through the entrance of another figure, in both scenes a servant. Now
                misunderstandings ensue and characterize the following part of each
                scene. . . . Both scenes close with rather meditative, subdued passages of thematic
                interest: Antipholus evokes the aura of magic . . . attributed to Ephesus ([<a href="#tln_0263" class="ref lb">263–7</a>]) and Adriana
                pours out her jealous lament ([<a href="#tln_0363" class="ref lb">363–91</a>]). This tripartite division remains the
                governing principle of scenic structure henceforward. Even if from the fourth act
                onwards the oscillation negates the scene divisions, the movement of the plot still
                pulsates regularly between turbulence and calm, is alternately speeded up and slowed
                down. (And appropriate changes of metre or movement between verse and prose
                underline these differences in scenic quality.)</p>

            <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">A danger of plotting by formula has to be averted. Shakespeare employs two
                plot strategies to counteract such mechanization. First, there is the repeated
                reporting of events dramatically presented earlier on. The Ephesian Dromio’s report
                  ([<a href="#tln_0320" class="ref lb">320–50</a>]) of
                the meeting with his presumptive master in the market-place to fetch him home to
                dinner first instances this plot-device. The incident is related again . . . on
                three further occasions through three different speakers [<a href="#tln_0402" class="ref lb">402–14</a>, <a href="#tln_0550" class="ref lb">550–8</a>, <a href="#tln_0624" class="ref lb">624–33</a>]. More than a third of the
                whole play is taken up by the narration of events which the spectator has [<i>17</i>] witnessed in the flesh. Most of 4.4 and 5.1 are
              largely given over to such reporting. These refractions of what has happened by
                those to whom it has happened provide glimpses of the suffering, jealous, choleric,
                greedy, mercantile humanity behind the swiftly moving plot. . . . The other
                strategy . . . consists in providing explanatory models for all the twists and
                turns of the plot . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_0263" class="ref lb">263–8</a>; <a href="#tln_0333" class="ref lb">333</a>].</p>

              that <i>Err.</i>, because it was performed at Gray’s Inn and was
              perhaps composed for the revels there, is an example of authorial act dividing,

          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Audience Involvement</h4>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">A recent approach to the play sees the audience in the theater as being forced to
            participate in the play. <a href="#b_shac1980" class="ref bibl">Shaw</a> (1980, pp. 17–18, 21–6): <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i> holds a place unique in the Shakespearean canon because it shows at
              once the most direct derivation from Roman comedy and, at the same time, an awareness
              of contemporary audience and occasion. This does not mean that the drama of the
              intervening years, particularly that of Renaissance Italy and the native English
              tradition, does not show its influence. Rather, there is something to be gained by
              looking at either end of a creative process—the pressure of Latin comedy at the
              beginning and the demands of occasion on performance at the end. If we can assume that
              this play as we have it in the Folio text shows signs of catering to an audience at
              least as learned as the playwright, then awareness of specific audience and perhaps
              also of the specific occasion of the Christmas revels at Gray’s Inn in December, 1594,
              encouraged Shakespeare to indulge in authorial virtuosity. . . . [I want to view the]
              play as an artistic performance whose comic success depends upon an [<i>18</i>] awareness of its deliberate eclecticism and of a craft expressly designed
              to set up a confrontation between stage representation and audience
              expectation.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She notes that little of the play is in prose and that the Dromios use blank verse when
            they are getting beaten and that <a href="#tln_0629" class="ref lb">629–746</a> is in rhymed couplets. Surely, the couching
              of such Plautine buffoonery in blank verse and rhyme suggests a conscious dichotomy
              for comic effect. Perhaps in this Shakespeare is following the lead of the courtly
              John Lyly . . . ; but if he is, then his audience would recognize the technique of
              imitation as well as the deliberate juxtaposition of action and speech
              pattern.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She continues with Terentian expansion of plot by <i>contaminatio</i> and how Sh. enriches the tone of the play as well, taking his
            cue from Terence again.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 21): Adriana . . . prevents the serious concerns from swamping the
              whole play. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>22</i>] This view of Adriana should lead us to
              consider with a somewhat less serious eye the disputation on husband-wife relations in
              which she engages with Luciana. Adriana is clearly a crowd-pleaser, and perhaps her
              considerations of marriage are designed to titillate a sophisticated mixed
              audience. . . . Adriana takes a firm view; a man is unruly and
                feeds from home ([<a href="#tln_0376" class="ref lb">376–7</a>]), and, therefore, a wife should be demanding and
              keep a tight rein. . . . [In <i>The Brothers</i>] Terence shows
              that the wisest course avoids the weakness of either extreme [of submission—Luciana’s
              position—or shrewishness], and surely this is what Adriana represents at the end of
              Shakespeare’s play and, regardless of what scripture says, the position that would
              most delight an audience at once aware of the stylistics of the argument and of the
              Terentian compromise.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Finally, how to account for the ending, with the last words given to the Dromios, not
            to those of higher rank? And why is it such a short play? (P. 24): Per­[<i>25</i>]haps a plausible answer . . . is that the play
              as we have it . . . is the version designed to fit into the special entertainment [at
              Gray’s Inn]. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            There is reason to suspect that <i>The Comedy of
                Errors</i> was . . . meant to be followed by a masque.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">She reviews the <i>Gesta</i> description. Considering
              the progress of events to the disorder, the indication is that had the evening’s
              entertainment continued as planned, the presentment, procession to state, and
              ceremonial compliments would have been followed by a play and a
              masque. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The end of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> seems to
              support this suggestion. After the denouement—the discovering and sorting out of the
              Antipholi [<i>26</i>] and the Dromios and the joyous reunion of
              parents with children and brothers with brothers—the major characters, led by the
              Duke, withdraw from the stage to celebrate the happy occasion. The two
              servants . . . are left on stage to go through a series of burlesque gestures as to
              who will leave the stage first, finally agreeing: [quotes <a href="#tln_1917" class="ref lb">1917–18</a>]. This posturing is
              suggestive of an antic dance, one type of comic contrast that gave rise to the
              antimasque in the Court Masques and could have been intended as a prelude to the
              masque dances. These measures, if this were the case, would be performed by members of
              Gray’s Inn and their ladies taking the place of the professional actors for the dance
              finale. She is one of very few who take pains to argue how <i>Err.</i> fits into the evening of revels, though many say casually that it may
            have been written for Gray’s Inn.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_husj1981" class="ref bibl">Huston</a> (1981,
            pp. 14–18, 21, 27): He [Sh.] builds a plot of mistaking, self-consciously
              contrived, and then he exuberantly pushes his characters around the world he has
              trapped them in, all the while encouraging his audience, which knows the reason for
              the mistaking, to laugh with him at the characters’ vain efforts to understand their
              situation. This artifice, which keeps the audience separated from the play (he
            uses play as <i>jeu</i> as well
            as drama), makes it unnecessary to develop character.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Yet (p. 15): In so addressing the audience, Shakespeare is, at least in
              part, attempting to extend the range of his mastery; he is including the audience, as
              well as players, stage, and props, in the world he controls. It is no wonder, then,
              that Shakespeare’s characteristic response to the members of his audience . . . is to
              manipulate them. He manipulates his characters too, and the relationships between
              these two kinds of manipulation variously define the worlds of Shakespeare’s comedies
              of play.</p>

              keeps his audience almost always at a distance from the action.

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">We watch the action from a position of almost godlike superiority, while
            the characters try to make sense of what is happening to them by proposing hypotheses.
            Sh. simultaneously encourages his audience into the play and makes us keep our distance;
            we know nearly everything; the characters appear increasingly mechanical, leading to
            Bergson’s definition of comedy (p. 18), the mechanical imposing itself
              on the human.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Almost. But not quite—because Shakespearean comedy is never as neat as
              a general critical summary would have it. He emphasizes the misleading
            beginning, analyzing 1.1 at length for all the discontinuities he finds,
            stating that discontinuity is thematic in the play.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">On lines <a href="#tln_0040" class="ref lb">40–7</a> (p.
            21): Egeon claims that his wife would have been happy but for him and
              for the fact that their luck was bad, and then he says that they were joyfully married
              and prosperous. The argument makes no sense. Of course, we know what Egeon means: the
              sorrow came <i>after</i> he and his wife had been happily married for
              some time, when they were separated. But that is not what Egeon says. So overwhelmed
              is he by present grief that he makes it color even his account of past
              joy. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            And what Egeon does at the beginning . . . he does throughout: he tries
              to impose a perfect, uncomplicated continuity on the complex, discontinuous
              experiences of his life.

              restorative power of miracle, which comes in the figure of the Abbess.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">At last the playwright reveals to his characters the secret he has shared with
              his audience since the second scene. And in the process he dissolves, at least for a
              moment, the distance between audience and characters. . . . And as characters become
              temporarily an audience [listening to Emilia], Shakespeare’s audience may recognize
              that this situation is reversible—that an audience may be transformed into characters
              by a world more expansive than the one the playwright creates. So Sh. plays
            with his audience, of course surprising them with Emilia’s revelation. The effect of the
            play is to help prepare its audience to cope with the unmanageable discontinuities of
            their own lives.</p>

              basic object, a prop like the rope or chain so solid it can be seen and touched,
              cannot be seen for what it is. The Ephesian Antipholus requests money and is brought a
              rope by his servant; Syracusan Antipholus finds his Dromio bringing not
              a rope as requested [sic; E. Antipholus sent for the rope] but gold, just as earlier
              he had received a chain without asking for one. . . . The characters . . . devise
              numerous interpretations of these strange events, even though all miss the
              mark.</p>

            When we attach a meaning to such objects, if we see . . . a social or

              than the stage’s confused characters? We ourselves thus confuse or
              exchange an object so that we can avoid mere spectacle, and thereby we sustain that
              delicate balance of the visual and the verbal essential to the theater.

              I shall look into the twin questions of how and in what thematic complexes
              Shakespeare avoids taking sides in order to guarantee the neutrality of his point of
              view and to leave the audience viewpoint indeterminate, and of how he seeks to clearly
              and unambiguously reveal his point of view and with it the viewpoint we are intended
              to adopt. My study can thus be seen as an attempt to reconcile deconstruction with
              orthodoxies and to bridge the gap between the two camps from the point of view of
              Shakespeare’s guiding of our response.</p>

            even to make a mark on predominantly male critics, but I do not want to leave the

              primarily with the recipient and his environment. Quite the reverse is the case. It is
              in the first instance the text itself [<i>27</i>] and its persuasive
              strategies that are responsible for the divergence of critical responses.</p>

              through a strange and wonderful turn of events, the audience is offered in the form of
              a rare and wonderful fiction. In the closing moments of
              that fiction the silent figure of Egeon bowled over by the unexpected revelations and
              recovery of wife and sons is a reminder to the audience that begetting children is a
              way of defeating mortality. For those who embrace the solution it offers, the Egeon
              story will have been authentically recreative. For those [<i>44</i>]
              who do not, the merry interval provided by the action it enframes may at least have

            §1): Shakespeare uses the possibility that Syracusan Antipholus is genuinely
              threatened by madness, and therefore death, to manipulate his audience’s
              anxieties. . . . Syracusan Antipholus’ descriptions of his transformed
              mind draw on specific, Elizabethan ideas about both supernatural and natural causes of
              madness.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The supernatural is demonic possession, the natural is the physical infection from
            eyebeams carrying spiritual vapors that produce love melancholy. He associates the
            water-drop passages with other passages in Sh. that connect loss of self with water, and
            these he connects with (§5) Foucault’s statement (<i>Madness and
              Civilization</i>) that one thing at least is certain, water and madness
              have long been linked in the dreams of European man.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He concludes (§26): <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is not <i>King Lear</i>. Nevertheless, as I have argued here, this seeming farce
              touches upon what would have been a genuine anxiety for the Elizabethan audience.
              Syracusan Antipholus is struggling for his mind and his life when he cries
              out . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_1224" class="ref lb">1224–6</a>]. Such outcries are comic because the audience is aware of the cause
              of Syracusan Antipholus’ confusion. But however faint, the anxiety produced by fear of
              madness remains, darkening the play’s entertaining confusions.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">For support of his showing the seriousness of the physical cause of madness, he uses
            from <i>OED</i> a definition of error
              (fury . . . extravagance of passion), the last citation of which is
            1460.</p>

              understood from two opposite points of view simultaneously: a whole plot can have a
              double meaning apparent to an audience but not to the characters in the
            tradition of Renaissance serious play as found in Erasmus and More.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 121): The disorientation of the spectator (and the would-be interpreter) are
              the very first things Shakespeare concentrates on . . . in its first scene. The
              opening lines sound like the end of a play, as a long court hearing concludes with a
              judgement: Egeon declares Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall, / And by the
                doom of death end woes and all [<a href="#tln_0005" class="ref lb">5–6</a>]. The impression that the case has been heard at
              some length seems confirmed by the Duke’s response: Merchant of Syracusa, plead
                no more [<a href="#tln_0007" class="ref lb">7</a>] and by Egeon’s
              answer, which repeats the stress on a long process terminating: Yet this my
                comfort, when your words are done, / My woes end likewise with the evening
                sun [<a href="#tln_0030" class="ref lb">30–1</a>]. The Duke brings matters to a close with perfunctory courtesy:
                Well, Syracusan, say in brief . . .  [<a href="#tln_0032" class="ref lb">32</a>]. Only with an effort can Egeon manage a reply at all:
              he sounds worn out: A heavier task could not have been impos’d / Than I to
                speak my griefs unspeakable [<a href="#tln_0035" class="ref lb">35–6</a>]. So, a wordless valediction and a finis? What
              happened to the rest of the play? The spectators, put off-balance in this way, are
              disconcerted again when the apparently exhausted Egeon embarks buoyantly on his story
              with the leisured amplitude of someone who has all the time in the world. He proceeds
              for an unhesitating sixty-four lines, then briefly pauses—O let me say no
                more [<a href="#tln_0097" class="ref lb">97</a>]—but only for
              rhetorical effect, while the Duke, having before enjoined brevity, is now egging him
              on: [quotes <a href="#tln_0099" class="ref lb">99</a>]. Twenty-two lines later,
              Egeon’s narrative still shows no signs of arriving at the present; meanwhile the Duke
              is settling down for a story he clearly feels is only just getting into its
                stride—Do me the favour to dilate at full ([<a href="#tln_0125" class="ref lb">125</a>]). That it should be just at this point that Egeon runs
              out of steam (he can only manage fifteen lines more) is a further droll Shakespearian
              touch.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He remarks that the play, in its dramatization of (p. 118) a providential
              pilgrimage that moves from a nativity to a last judgement . . . must also,

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_tile1965" class="ref bibl">Tillyard</a> (1965, pp. 64–6): I must digress about the use
              Shakespeare makes of gold, which is very frequently mentioned in the play. The motive
              of the gold chain . . . first enters at the end of the first scene of act two. Here
              Adriana tells her sister that her husband has [<i>65</i>] promised her
              the gold chain. She then proceeds to moralize about gold in lines which unfortunately
              are corrupt. . . . It is at least clear that gold is solid and will stand up to
              rubbing in the way that mere surface enamel will not: [quotes <a href="#tln_0385" class="ref lb">385–7</a>]. . . . But the gold chain
              behaves in a way alien to the solidity from which it is fashioned. It eludes its true
              owner, it leads to all kinds of mistakes, and the man to whom it is given in error
              enjoys it as one of a number of things of whose existence he is doubtful. In fact,
              though Antipholus does not actually state it, the chain for him is fairy-gold and
              might wither away to nothing at any moment. No sooner has the wrong Antipholus got the
              chain than (IV, i) we see a merchant pressing the goldsmith for a debt . . . [quotes
                <a href="#tln_0997" class="ref lb">997–1000</a>]. The
              rope is a substitute for the chain he would have [<i>66</i>] given,
              had his wife behaved herself. But it is more than that, for it was no accident that
              the rope enters the play in a context of gold. As gold keeps on attaching itself to
              Antipholus of Syracuse, so ropes attach themselves, metaphorically and literally, to
              Antipholus of Ephesus. As the latter fails to get the chain that belongs to him and
              later the gold that should set him free from bonds, so does he get the rope’s end he
              has ordered and must submit to be bound by ropes in a way he had not bargained for. In
              fact, gold and rope are contrasted symbols of what the two brothers experience; and
              there is a delightful irony in the younger brother’s distrusting the first, and the
              elder brother’s not welcoming the second.</p>

              of crosspurposes. . . . The physical/verbal emphasis is consistent:
                chain occurs 45 times, and gold (with compounds) 32
              times. They compose an early test case for Shakespearean symbolism. . . . What does
                gold, with chain, signify?</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The first law of Shakespearean symbolism is that it is never forced. The
              symbolic implications flow easily and naturally from the literal object (or activity),
              which itself appears to emerge inevitably from the course of the play. . . . In
                <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> the use made of gold
              (and money, and chain) compels two questions: what are
              the natural associations of gold, and what associations are especially
              generated in the context of the play?
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The second question dominates the first, for gold, [<i>36</i>] clearly, has tremendous positive and negative
              potentialities. . . . In <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, it is plainly
              regarded as an instrument of communication. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            One has to avoid a stock response to gold (and also,
                chain) as something with innate criminal tendencies. Now in this
              play, no one <i>uses</i> gold as a means of expressing personality, or
              of controlling others. It is purely a mode of doing business, and (for Adriana) of
              confirming that a promise will be kept. . . . The recent critical tendency to allow
              the obvious implications of chain to wander into the field, designated
              as Adriana’s possessiveness has little foundation in the text. For
              Adriana’s [<i>37</i>] attitude is stated in her first reference to it:
              [quotes <a href="#tln_0382" class="ref lb">382</a>]; and the word <i>promise</i>, with its associations of bond-holding and oath-keeping
              is the major underlying concept. If Adriana had harped on chain more
              than the others, one could allow a certain associative transference, but in fact she
              does not. I see no ironic juxtaposition of personal and commercial values in this
              play.

            pp. 75–7): E. Antipholus owes Angelo the cost of the chain. Goldsmiths, in
              Shakespeare’s age . . . were more than craftsmen. In the vacuum of formal financial
              establishments . . . they frequently assumed the role of [<i>76</i>]
              bankers. . . . In agreeing to fashion the chain, and in delivering it to the man he
              thinks is the Ephesian Antipholus, Angelo makes a form of loan; the breaking of this
              obligation violates a civil agreement. Shakespeare intensifies the chain’s
              significance as a symbol of civic and professional responsibility . . . by
              constructing another social obligation, that of Angelo’s debt to the Second Merchant
              of Ephesus. . . . Where Plautus was satisfied with what one might call
                simple dramatic confusion, Shakespeare multiplies the line of
              dependency, suggesting . . . that discord on one level of society—that is, the
              familial and marital—translates into the breakdown of convention along others: here,
              the professional/commercial. . . . [<i>77</i>] Just as this scene,
              with its temporal urgency and confusion of identity, goes a significant distance
              toward encapsulating the action of the play itself, so is the golden chain—in its
              concatenation of wife, courtesan, goldsmith, merchant, and brother—a piece of
              dramaturgical currency emblematic of larger issues in the drama.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_dawa2001" class="ref bibl">Dawson &amp; Yachnin</a> (2001) offer essays in which one argues with the
            other about whether to understand the Elizabethan theater (p. 2) on the more or
              less local situation . . . , finding a new understanding of theatrical pleasure in a
              study of the early modern idea of the person, the practice and theory
              of acting, the humoral model of the body, and the sacrament of the Eucharist
            (Dawson) or by locating it in the <i>longue
                durée</i> of western cultural history, looking especially at the long-term
              consequences of the stage’s project of self-definition within the early modern luxury
              market (Yachnin). Dawson writes about the chain in response to Yachnin’s
            comments on the fetishizing of Desdemona’s handkerchief (p. 140): The
              chain is a commodity, a fact that is frequently emphasized in the play, most obviously
              in relation to the money it costs and the many references to its possible or actual
              circulation (from Angelo to Antipholus of Ephesus, to the Courtesan, to Antipholus of
              Ephesus again, to Adriana, and tangentially, but crucially, to Antipholus of
              Syracuse); not to mention the fact that the payment for it is presented as the
              necessary means of bailing the goldsmith out of bondage both to the Merchant who
              appears in 4.1 and to the sergeant at law. It is clear that Ephesus is a [<i>141</i>] deeply commercial city, dedicated to the circulation of
              capital and rife with merchants and ducats, prepared even to forgive its mortal
              enemies if they can ante up a sufficient amount of cash.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            The commercial circulation of the chain is disturbed when it goes to
              Antipholus of Syracuse rather than Antipholus of Ephesus, a derailment that is not
              sorted out until the very end when, as the text suggests, the foreign twin hands it
              over to the native brother. When he first receives it, Antipholus of Syracuse
              transforms what is really a simple commercial transaction into a fortunate
                golden gift ([<a href="#tln_0977" class="ref lb">977</a>]), of a
              piece with the other mysterious goings-on that lead him throughout the play to
              expatiate on the sometimes dangerous, sometimes enticing mysteries of Ephesus, its
                mists ([<a href="#tln_0612" class="ref lb">612</a>, <i>mist</i>]) and madness, its witches and sorcerers ([<a href="#tln_0265" class="ref lb">265–6</a>]). In other
              words, he fetishizes the chain, mystifying its actual commodity value . . . ; but the
              play as a whole takes comic pleasure in showing just how wrong he is. One indication
              of the real social origin of the chain is the fact, emphasized in the play and
              exploited as a source of the errors of the plot, that it is actually being forged as
              the action is proceeding. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Hence the detour via the wrong Antipholus that the chain makes serves a
              double purpose—it leads to a theatrical highlighting of the delusive, magical potency
              of the chain, and to a demystifying of that potency through an insistence on the
              chain’s commercial and artisanal origins. The audience is made aware of the careful
              process of producing luxury items such as jewelry. . . . And the psychological and
              cultural tendency to give such commodities more weight than they can easily bear is
              thereby brought into question, comically deconstructed by the chain’s circu­[<i>142</i>]lation. The demystifying process is abetted by the audience’s
              more or less unconscious awareness that the gold chain is really just a
              prop, probably made of lead or paste, not gold.
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            But still, the chain remains a potent theatrical object—first of all by
              virtue of being highlighted on stage, and secondly as an agent of the cunning process
              of mystification/demystification and, we might add, re-mystification, that the text
              puts into operation. What I mean by this last point is that for all the insistence on
              the commercial foundation of the chain and its circulation, it remains a powerfully
              associative object, linked to the multiple bonds between brothers, between parents and
              children, between husbands and wives—i.e. to those primal sources of feeling to which
              Shakespeare returns again and again in his plays. . . . The play with the chain is an
              instance of theatrical self-promotion, deriving from a delighted recognition that it
              is the theatre, not the market, that confers a charge on objects as they appear on
              stage. To think of it in this way is to shift attention from Yachnin’s broad claim
              that Shakespearean investment in objects like the handkerchief is part of a long
              historical process whereby literature is born out of the theatre’s exploitation of the
              status system, to a more modest and historically specific claim that the theatre, in
              taking over and transforming cultural discourses, heightens its own <i>representational</i> power.

              The third principle [after family and state] which is involved in this
              entanglement is business—the commercial relations of the community. . . . The matter
              [of not paying for the chain] is at first treated as a jest, then it grows serious,
              and at last an officer is called in to enforce the demand. Here Authority is drawn
              into the meshes, and is victimized by an [<i>69</i>]
              appearance. . . . Public order is disturbed [and the resolution must begin]. But the
              difficulty cannot rest here; the abbess has defied the Family in the wife, and the Law
              in the officer; the conflict can only be settled by an appeal to the supreme authority
              of the land. But the Duke is likewise deluded, and all is clarified by the
            recognition of the twins; <a href="#b_broj1957" class="ref bibl">Brown</a> (1957, p. 54); <a href="#b_cutj1968" class="ref bibl">Cutts</a> (1968, pp. 18–19); <a href="#b_hamd1992" class="ref bibl">Hamilton</a> (1992, p. 78): The golden

              Londoners themselves focused on; both identity and status depended increasingly on
              one’s material goods. Because the society was more and more cognizant that what one
                <i>was</i> was largely determined by what one <i>owned</i>, the chief emphasis in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> on
                [<i>185</i>] possessions, on being possessed (by marriage,
              witchcraft, or grace), and on being dispossessed unites the play’s Ephesus with
              Shakespeare’s London.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Closely connected to the imagery involving the golden chain is that of the rope and its
            power to bind as well as to flog. Egeon enters perhaps bound in 1.1, and certainly
            reenters bound in 5.1 (see <a href="#tln_1823" class="ref lb">1823</a>). E.
            Antipholus and his Dromio are bound in 4.4 (after <a href="#tln_1394" class="ref lb">1394</a>), only to have Antipholus gnaw their way free (<a href="#tln_1726" class="ref lb">1726</a>). In 4.1 E. Antipholus sends Dromio to buy a rope’s end
            to punish Adriana for locking him out of his house (<a href="#tln_0998" class="ref lb">998</a>).</p>

            pp. 4, 44, 80–1): Soliloquies and monologic fragments . . . individualize
              Shakespeare’s characters and endow them with motive and intention, conflict and
              complexity. In other words, they communicate a mental life which we perceive as
              lifelike far more effectively than simple description of a psychic event. To
              communicate the sense of a character’s inner life requires a different mode of
              presentation. Monologues must be made to look and sound like dialogue, which
            best presents the illusion of mental activity.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Plautus has been overlooked as a model for imbuing monologue with
            the characteristics of dialogue to give the speaker a mental life, using rhetorical
            questions, objectification of the self in second- or third-person self-references, and
            paradox. These rhetorical devices occur whenever identity is a serious thematic concern
            or when it is parodied.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">These devices she demonstrates in Plautus and Terence, beginning with <i>Amphitryo</i> [her sp.] 404–8 (p. 44): Didn’t our ship arrive this very
              night from Perse Harbour, and me on it? Didn’t my master send me here? Aren’t I
              standing in front of our own house, and so forth, where Sosia is speaking to
            his double, the disguised Mercury; she gives further examples of the rhetorical items
            and devices, drawn mostly from <i>Pseudolus</i>, and then in <i>Err.</i></p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Of 575–81 (p. 80), We find the series of rhetorical questions characteristic of
              such speeches which set up the I/you dichotomy of dialogue. The switch from the first
              to the third person, from I to our . . . includes the
              audience in the errors and mistakes which Antipholus experiences. The inverted syntax
              of sleep I now and the oxymoron sure uncertainty signal
              an unhomogeneous structure of answer and response.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Of 608–12 (p. 81): Shakespeare uses rhetorical schema to represent his divided
              mind: antitheses ([<a href="#tln_0609" class="ref lb">609</a>]), anaphora, and
              chiasmus ([<a href="#tln_0610" class="ref lb">610</a>]). . . . These lines show
              Antipholus learning that identity depends at least in part on others’ conceptions of
              him: on self, but as Adriana has suggested in her speech, on others as
            well.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_cham1993" class="ref bibl">Charney</a> (1993,

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            One final example of the extraordinary test flights of verse . . . is
              the long, hyperbolic description launched by Dromio of Syracuse of the officer who has
              arrested his master: [quotes <a href="#tln_1142" class="ref lb">1142–7</a>]. The hyperboles continue for a few more lines,
              then are taken up again in the next scene for another sixteen lines ([<a href="#tln_1200" class="ref lb">1200–15</a>—prose]). The
              Officer, who is described so elaborately, has no real role in the play but only acts
              as the vehicle of hyperbole. Shakespeare seems to be enjoying himself with verbal
              pyrotechnics, which he imagined to be an intrinsic part of a classical style.

            57): Although much of it is written in verse of considerable virtuosity
                <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is one of Shakespeare’s least
              obviously poetical plays. In it his verbal powers are fully at the service of his
              overall dramatic aims. Often the situations require no more than swift, economical
              writing, carrying us along briskly from one comic point to the next. But Shakespeare,
              already a master of dramatic rhythm, knew that the pace would become wearisome if it
              remained unvaried. From time to time he relaxes the pace of the ongoing action to
              allow the inclusion of passages of comic writing in which the situation is not
              advanced but enlarged upon. Such is Dromio of Syracuse’s brilliant description of the
              kitchen wench who, mistaking him for his twin, presses her attentions upon him:
              [quotes <a href="#tln_0886" class="ref lb">886–91</a>]. . . . [Dromio’s] comic catechism . . . preserves the comic tone
              while giving us a rest from following the complications of the action. Equally
              brilliant in a different way is Antipholus of Ephesus’s description of Dr Pinch and
              his efforts to cure him of his supposed madness: [quotes <a href="#tln_1712" class="ref lb">1712–17</a>].</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In its matching of style to content, its dramatic economy, its tautness
              of construction, and its bold interfusion of farce with romance, <i>The
                Comedy of Errors</i> has claims to be considered as Shakespeare’s first real
              masterpiece.

              through rhymes, puns, figures of speech, and other means—may help to explain in part
              why so many directors from the early nineteenth century to the present have seen
              fit . . . to jazz it up. The play is . . . a virtuoso display of the
              phonetic resources of the language. It insists on putting eye and ear in tension with
              one another, and therefore creates many of its effects through what may be described

              individualities. . . . The differentiation between the brothers amounts mainly to

              Their reactions when faced with the painful or ridiculous consequences to themselves
              of an absurd imbroglio are not quite those of flesh-and-blood people under the shrewd
              or humiliating blows of fortune; they grow most amusing when most persecuted by fate.
              The paradox . . . is very cleverly managed, and each participant in the general
              make-believe preserves his idiosyncrasies too well not to remain individual and
              convincing. But it is plain, at the same time, that everybody is out to make the huge
              joke a success. He calls <i>Err.</i> a pleasant,

              attributes: We raise no question about an underlying character that
              would hold together all his [S. Antipholus’s] attributes because he gives no
              indication of a distinct inner life. . . . His plans and motives coincide with his
              behavior so that he suffers no inner conflict. . . . [S. Antipholus] loves
              Luciana . . . because he is a young man, and it is natural for young men to fall in

              membership in the family. Yet the story leads us to make one tacit distinction among
              his attributes, separating the conditional from the unconditional. Antipholus’s
              irritation at Dromio is conditional upon their misunderstandings; his love for Luciana
              is an unconditional trait of being a young man; so too his desire for fulfillment
              within his family. . . . We assume that Adriana will become a patient, obedient wife
              once she has been instructed properly, that Luciana will love Antipholus once she
              learns that he is not her brother-in-law, and that Antipholus will not beat his
              servant once he learns the source of confusion. We assume that our standards of proper
              behavior are normal, so that some of Antipholus’s traits are temporary

            (1924, pp. 25–6): As a figure of wronged wifehood she becomes almost tragically
              convincing, which very fact makes her, dramatically speaking, the most serious blemish
              on the play. Adultery has always been one of the stock jokes of the fabliau . . . and
              its inevitable concomitant is the perennial jest of the <i>cornuto</i> or his feminine equivalent. For Adriana to have been
              simply the typical jealous shrew would be quite in keeping with a story that is half
              Latin comedy and half Renaissance merry tale. Probably she was first
              conceived as that, for there is a good streak of the shrew in her. But then she
              suddenly steps out of the frame of farce: the conventional carpings with which she has
              been answering the conventional smugness of her sister, break into the bitter reality
              of [quotes <a href="#tln_0365" class="ref lb">365–73</a>].
              At her next appearance she is face to face with, as she thinks, her unfaithful

              the servants’ pates across, though that hardly gives her characteristic distinction in
              a play in which fisticuffs are the regular means of intercourse. She rails at bed and
              board, and jealousy gives venom to her clamours, adding to them a virulence of which
              Plautus could scarcely avail himself, for it is only love in the modern sense
                which is full of jealousy. An English shrew, moreover, . . . is
              hampered by memories of the affection she once had for the man of her choice. Adriana
              even fondles at times. But her single lapse into the broken-hearted bride who will
              weep and die in tears is a fall both from type and from character. A more credibly
              humanizing trait appears in her excited enlargement of her husband’s frenzied acts:
              the duke is treated to a display of rumour’s growth, as facts swell with fancy when
              she recounts the incidents she thought she had seen ([<a href="#tln_1608" class="ref lb">1608</a>] ff.). Yet at the end of the play, the shrew is not so
              much out of countenance as she was meant to be. . . . [<i>69</i>] The
              general temper of life depicted in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is so
              crude, coarse, and brutal, that Adriana’s fault appears to be not so much her
              shrewishness as her undiplomatic use of it. Even the abbess accuses her of nothing
              more heinous than bad tactics: —[quotes <a href="#tln_1552" class="ref lb">1552–5</a>].</p>

              to a servant, Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across [<a href="#tln_0354" class="ref lb">354</a>]. But it is quite natural for their
              forerunner, Adriana, to speak thus to Dromio of Ephesus (line [<a href="#tln_0354" class="ref lb">354</a>]). Her sister Luciana’s rebuke of her—Fie, how
                impatience loureth in your face! [<a href="#tln_0362" class="ref lb">362</a>]—is histrionically revealing; such was the look that Shakespeare intended
              the boy-actor who created this part to employ continually. That look
              goes along with conduct, potentially at least, violent. And certainly the heroine of
              this drama has her full share in its mad doings. Yet louring impatience is merely on
              the surface of her; deep beneath is a devoted, yearning love for her
              husband. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            There is pathos, too, in her case, but the dramatist carefully
              subordinates it. When her sister urges her to be patient with her careless husband,
              Adriana exclaims [quotes <a href="#tln_0308" class="ref lb">308–11</a>]. True enough. But our sympathy with the speaker is overtopped by
              amusement at her mood of angry exaggeration. She is far from being a wretched
                soul bruised with adversity [<a href="#tln_0308" class="ref lb">308</a>]. Her only real woe, here, is that her husband is very late for dinner. To
              be sure, she hints that he may be with another woman (line [<a href="#tln_0304" class="ref lb">304</a>]). But this suspicion, entirely unfounded so far as the
              audience knows, is very faint and transient. All the more comical, therefore, is her
              great blaze of jealousy (lines [<a href="#tln_0363" class="ref lb">363</a>] ff.)
              when the strange demeanour of Antipholus of Syracuse, mistaken for her husband, has
              been reported to her. At this juncture the device of mistaken identity is superbly
              used for comedy of character. Antipholus of Syracuse, unlike his jaunty brother, is
              gravely moral. When finally he enters Adriana’s presence and she regards him as
              Antipholus of Ephesus, he is exactly the man to look strange and frown
                ([<a href="#tln_0505" class="ref lb">505</a>]). No wonder his bearing turns
              Adriana’s suspicion into a settled con­[<i>101</i>]viction. But
              now comes the finest stroke of all. Confronted with real trouble, . . . as she
              believes, in her husband’s life, her better nature comes to the fore. She drops her
              initial notion ([<a href="#tln_0284" class="ref lb">284</a>]) that her own way of
              life should, by rights, be as free as her husband’s. She maintains indeed that there
              should be (in modern parlance) a single standard for both the sexes but she urges
              passionately that it should be pure and high [quotes <a href="#tln_0519" class="ref lb">519–39</a>]. How direct and powerful is
              the style here over against the neat, conventional rhetoric of the preceding
              quotation! This is one of the many instances . . . where Shakespeare’s good luck or
              good revision, or both, enables him to sharpen the style in accordance with the
              emotion. Here the pathos, by itself, would be too keen for comedy. But it is checked,
              for us, even as Adriana speaks, by the amazed looks of her two Syracusan listeners,
              wondering what it is all about; and it is submerged by the mirth, madder than ever,
              that ensues.

              farce: the troubled adventures of Antipholus of Ephesus’ long-suffering wife. She is
              so disturbed when the other Antipholus treats her strangely that one might think
              Shakespeare wanted us to share her tears and frustrations. She and her sister and her
              maid, and eventually her real husband’s mistress, form a dreary female procession
              through the quick twists of the plot. But I believe that Shakespeare expected us to
              laugh at them also, and that, in performance, would be largely a matter of tempo. The
              film of a funeral, even, may be made laughable if it is run off at twice the proper
              speed, and if we saw the bewildered women running and dripping at the same time we

              love is scarcely central to the play, however one assesses it; and to denounce the
                possessiveness of Adriana seriously overstates the
              situation. . . . While Adriana is doubtless in the Roman tradition of the shrew, the
              contours are much softened. She is presented as an intelligent and independent woman
              fretting against an un­[<i>32</i>]reasonable social framework
              rather than one unreasonable in herself. Her scene with Luciana (II, 1) appears to
              place her in the Euripides-Shaw tradition of females who are in no way inclined to
              defer to the mores of a masculine society: Why should their liberty than ours
                be more ([<a href="#tln_0284" class="ref lb">284</a>]) is the position

              that Adriana is making use of to justify her disquiet. She is, quite simply, terrified
              of losing her husband; to regain him, and not a proto-Fabian liberty of action, is her
              desire. . . . [Lines <a href="#tln_1131" class="ref lb">1131–4</a> reveal] the truth of her anguish and fears. She does have

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The lack of any scene in which Adriana directly confronts her erring
              husband is striking because her misery and insistence on the inequity of her situation
              give <i>Errors</i> much of its emotional ballast. Her
            complaints to Luciana and the abbess are not heard by her husband; perhaps Sh. was
            unwilling to risk making the other mistakes trivial by plumbing this discord.
              Although some critics have suggested that Adriana alienated her husband by a
              jealous possessiveness, she is not the eternally suspicious comic shrew that other
              dramatists portray. Her manner is never strident or undignified; her requests are
              never unreasonable. Balthazar, a voice of sanity in the play, speaks of her
                unviolated honor, of her wisdom. / Her sober virtue, years and
                modesty [<a href="#tln_0749" class="ref lb">749</a>, <a href="#tln_0750" class="ref lb">750–1</a>]—hardly the attributes of a
              jealous nag. The worst that [<i>30</i>] Antipholus E. can say of her
              is that she is shrewish if he keeps not hours [<a href="#tln_0620" class="ref lb">620</a>]—that is, if he is not home at a reasonable

            pp. 114–15): Throughout the entire play Adriana is continually given an emotional
              dimension beyond that of the traditional shrew, the one-dimensional figure of farcical
              fun who needs to be beaten into submission, producing a conflict of tone
            between horseplay and matrimonial subplot that looks ahead to later plays.
              Luciana, despite her apparent gentle pliability, also comes across as
              distinctly coldblooded in her suggestion to Antipholus of Syracuse (mistaken for his
              brother) that he dissemble, appear to love Adriana while seeking enjoyment elsewhere.
              She apparently accepts the double standard . . . : [quotes <a href="#tln_0791" class="ref lb">791–810</a>]. . . . [<i>115</i>] This code of behavior leaves a nasty taste with the audience; the
              mettlesome wife has a legitimate complaint, and with feminine friends such as Luciana
              an enemy is superfluous.</p>

            tardiness for dinner Adriana’s behavior assumes a deeper and more richly
              suggestive character than the mere ragings of a jealous housewife. Her determination
              to refrain from eating despite the fact that her husband is two hours late ([<a href="#tln_0277" class="ref lb">277</a>]) indicates a serious attempt to maintain
              personal equilibrium and social bonds in the face of heavy pressure. Adriana is no
              mere jealous shrew (her readiness to forgive later in the play is too often slighted);
              rather she is a fiercely combative woman confronting squarely the threat of an

              however, is that religious withdrawal is not a male response to catastrophe in

              the text suggest an end to Aemilia’s celibacy. Aemilia’s concluding speech abounds in
              Christian references that emphasize her former religious identity rather than a new or
              resumed secular one. . . . A defrocked Aemilia remains outside the play, difficult to
              imagine. Even an Aemilia who leaves her office to live with Egeon, ruling her
              household and extended family as she had the abbey, is more easily envisaged as a
              celibate—affectionately a wife, sexually a widow. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>161</i>] Aemilia rejects sexuality, ensuring her
              fidelity to her lost husband as she serves another Father, another Son, sublimating
              desire through love of a male-engendered God. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[Her] importance is increased as she is moved from the utmost margins
              of the play . . . to a prominent place in its conclusion. She becomes a major
            agent in the plot by holding back the Syracusans, she reproves Adriana and so restores
            domestic order, and she appropriates the Duke’s authority with her long speech.
              Thus as Aemilia suddenly becomes a major character, her actions and authority
              interrogate the doctrine Luciana had expounded in II.i maintaining women’s lower place
              in the world order. . . . Neither wife nor widow, celibate Aemilia is herself an
              error, confounding gender roles and locating an inadequacy in the hierarchizing of the
              social formation, as she bridges and breaches categories, successfully, irreducibly

            as the result of Shn. intentional manipulation. On the one hand her prestige and
            authority are insisted on by making her an Abbess, the head of a priory, and one who
            cures people. But she is undermined too: Not unlike Luciana in the <i>débat</i> scene [2.2] the Abbess repeatedly
              resorts to proverbs and proverbial phrases, whose hollowness . . . undermines her
              conjugal counsel as noted by <a href="#b_ornr1986" class="ref bibl">Ornstein</a>. The Abbess reveals herself to be
              an authoritarian rather than an authoritative adviser. Note that both her first and
              last utterances are orders (ll. [<a href="#tln_1505" class="ref lb">1505</a>] and
                [<a href="#tln_1581" class="ref lb">1581</a>]). And her walking out on Adriana

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            [Her] authority is perhaps most decisively undermined by a crowning
              irony that has escaped critical attention: How can she possibly bring Adriana’s
              husband to his wits and make of him a formal man again, if she is housing the <i>Syracusian</i> Antipholus? By taking in the wrong Antipholus, she,
              too, is taken in. The Abbess, too, becomes a victim of discrepant awareness; she is
              not allowed either to dispose of the (whole) truth needed for her remedial endeavours
              to be successful. . . .

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_knt2" class="ref witness">Knight</a> (ed.
            1842, pp. 206–7): Antipholus of Ephesus is decidedly inferior to his brother in
              the quality of his intellect and the tone of his morals. He is scarcely justified in
              calling his wife shrewish [<a href="#tln_0620" class="ref lb">620</a>]. . . . [He] has somewhat hard measure dealt to him throughout the
              progress of the Errors; —but he deserves it. His doors are shut against him, it is
              true; —in his impatience he would force his way into his house, against the
              remonstrances of the good Balthazar: —[quotes <a href="#tln_0750" class="ref lb">750–2</a>]. He departs, but not in patience
                [<a href="#tln_0755" class="ref lb">755</a>]; —he is content to dine from home,
              but not at the Tiger [<a href="#tln_0756" class="ref lb">756</a>].
              His resolve— That chain will I bestow
                  <br/>(Be it for nothing but to spite my wife) <br/>Upon mine hostess [<a href="#tln_0778" class="ref lb">778–80</a>]—
              would not have been made by his brother in a similar situation. He has spited his
              wife; he has dined with the courtesan. But he is not satisfied: —[quotes <a href="#tln_0997" class="ref lb">997–9</a>]. We pity him not
              when he is arrested, nor when he receives the [<i>207</i>]
                rope’s end instead of his ducats [<a href="#tln_1297" class="ref lb">1297</a>, <a href="#tln_1294" class="ref lb">1294</a>].
              His furious passion with his wife, and the foul names he bestows on her, are quite in
              character; and when he has Beaten the maids a-row, and
                  bound the doctor, [<a href="#tln_1643" class="ref lb">1643</a>] we cannot have a suspicion that the doctor was practising on
              the wrong patient. In a word, we cannot doubt that, although the Antipholus of Ephesus
              may be a brave soldier, who took deep scars [<a href="#tln_1669" class="ref lb">1669</a>] to save his prince’s life, —and that he really has a
              right to consider himself much injured, —he is strikingly opposed to the Antipholus of
              Syracuse; that he is neither sedate, nor gentle, nor truly-loving; —that he has no
              habits of self-command; —that his temperament is sensual; —and that, although the
              riddle of the perplexity is solved, he will still find causes of unhappiness, and
              entertain a huge infectious troop
                  <br/>Of pale distemperatures [<a href="#tln_1550" class="ref lb">1550–1</a>].</p>

              about the matter of his lost family; O’Brien apparently supposes that he has
            some information about that family. It is no wonder that he is exasperated; yet
              his whole tone is coarser and more violent than his brother’s; and indeed he is not at
              all an engaging personage in himself, though his storms of rage and his ineffectual
              struggles to get into his own house doubtless heighten the fun of the

              is good, and he has been a valiant soldier in the service of the Duke. . . . [He] is

              choleric; the younger Antipholus is in comparison melancholy, sensitive, and of a
              livelier imagination. He gives examples, from E. Antipholus’s proposing to
            break into his house to S. Antipholus’s pessimism about finding his brother and being
            slow to figure out why people greet him.</p>

            30): In the play’s design he is the temperamental complement of his brother; his
              explanation of a disordered world is that the others are mad or leagued in conspiracy
              against him. The proud, self-sufficient man of property, bound in a dark room, is a
              note whose significance in Shakespeare’s future no one fails to recognize, but it is
              allowed to develop no overtones here.</p>

            (1977, pp. 33–5): Antipholus is no model husband who—as Eph.
              5:33 says—should love his wife as he loves himself.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 34): It has often been explained that his visit to the Porcupine is a spontaneous
            reaction to being locked out of his own house. That explains it indeed, but whether
            sufficiently or not remains a question. He is not simply an affronted husband who
            wanders aimlessly through the streets and finally finds consolation with a
            courtesan. . . . Our Antipholus knows the maiden and describes her from his own
            experience [quotes <a href="#tln_0770" class="ref lb">770–1</a>]—doubtless a pleasant partner, unlike Adriana (possibly because she
            wasn’t forced to marry), but she is still an anonymous courtesan whom one can buy for
            money. To annoy his wife the rich citizen Antipholus will give the Courtesan a gift. The
            gold chain that he meant to give to his wife to appease her and make up for his neglect,
            is now supposed to buy free love. Since later on his Syracusan brother
            gets the chain, he takes the Courtesan’s ring he had
              at dinner
            perforce ([<a href="#tln_1251" class="ref lb">1251</a>, <a href="#tln_1277" class="ref lb">1277</a>]). [<a href="#b_scha1977" class="ref bibl">Schlösser</a> seems to believe the
            Courtesan’s fiction, <a href="#tln_1275" class="ref lb">1275–9</a>.] The ring symbolizes rather straightforwardly the kind of good
              cheer ([<a href="#tln_1881" class="ref lb">1881–2</a>]) he enjoyed with her; this relationship is not just platonic. His
            parenthetical assertion that Adriana suspects him without reason ([<a href="#tln_0773" class="ref lb">773</a>]) is simply intended not to give himself away in front of
            his acquaintances (and possibly before certain parts of the audience). Reputation is
            important to an honorable citizen; his credit is based on it; he doesn’t dare, as
            Balthazar warns him . . . , to expose himself to vulgar comment ([<a href="#tln_0761" class="ref lb">761</a>]), and he will try to cover up his affairs
            (Ger.). [Schlösser is alone in his cynicism.]</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">At home he need not be so careful. As Luciana’s plea to the wrong brother shows, he
            doesn’t even try [<i>35</i>] to <i>act</i> the loving
            husband. Her all too Solomonic advice to have his affair conducted secretly and to play
            the loyal husband ([<a href="#tln_0801" class="ref lb">801</a>]) is no recipe for
            an ideal marriage, but it explicitly refers to a marriage for money where convenience is
            substituted for feeling. But even this is foreign to Adriana’s husband. He wants to
              tame the shrew as well as the servants with a rope’s end ([<a href="#tln_0998" class="ref lb">998</a>]). This would not be a capital crime in the
            British tradition of burlesque; but it is, along with the endless beatings, a drastic
            signal of the loss of human bonds; and it serves this Antipholus right when he is
            mistakenly arrested for debt and declared crazy by a psychiatric expert [sic] Dr. Pinch
            and is then tied up and led away (Ger.).</p>

              soldier and a man about town—he is like him in his solitude of spirit. This is
              suggested not only in the neglect of his wife, but in the little debate he conducts
              with his guest Balthazar on the respective merits of food and conviviality [quotes
                <a href="#tln_0638" class="ref lb">638–50</a>]. . . . [He] tends to be materialistic [<i>169</i>] and
              lacking in charity. This is amplified a few moments later when, enraged by his wife’s
              innocent refusal to let him in . . . he threatens to break down the door with a
              crowbar until Balthazar persuades him that to do so might permanently damage his
              reputation. . . . [Rather than patiently bide his time by dining at the Tiger,] he
              invites his guests to the Porpentine, where the courtesan resides, and presents her
              with the golden chain intended for Adriana. He is a petty and legalistic man, who sees
              a wife merely as a mindless instrument of his own comfort.</p>

              so it seems, of insensitivity rather than habitual infidelity. He is obtuse and
              quick-tempered, ready to engage in a flyting match with his servants or to tear down
              the gate to his house with a crowbar, but he is not loutish. . . . [His description
              of the courtesan is a] circumspect description [that] does not come from the lips of a
              libertine; Antipholus E. is a successful businessman who uses his wife’s mistreatment
              of him as an excuse for a night on the town. Because he is too coarse-grained and
              attached to his comforts to spend years in search of a lost brother, one doubts that
              he would understand Adriana’s ideal of marriage even if he heard her pleas.

            masters. But there is certainly a marked difference in the quality of their
              mirth. [E. Dromio] is precise and antithetical, striving to utter his jests with
              infinite gravity and discretion, and approaching a pun with a sly solemnity that is
              prodigiously diverting: —[quotes <a href="#tln_0209" class="ref lb">209–12</a>, <a href="#tln_0247" class="ref lb">247–9</a>]. He is a formal humorist, and, we have no doubt,
              spoke with a drawling and monotonous accent, fit for his part in such a dialogue as
              this: —[quotes <a href="#tln_1355" class="ref lb">1355–62</a>]. On the contrary, the merry jests [<a href="#tln_0184" class="ref lb">184</a>] of Dromio of Syracuse all come from the outpouring of
              his gladsome heart. He is a creature of prodigious animal spirits, running over with
              fun and queer similitudes. [<i>208</i>] He makes not the slightest
              attempt at arranging a joke, but utters what comes uppermost with irrepressible
              volubility. He is an untutored wit; and we have no doubt gave his tongue such active
              exercise, by hurried pronunciation and variable emphasis, as could alone make his long

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_clac1873" class="ref bibl">Clarke</a> (1873,
            pp. 525–6): Luciana . . . is a domestic philosopher. She has conned
              lessons of connubial discretion in an excellent school—the house of her married
              sister, Adriana. She has learned forbearance from observing the other’s intolerance;
              she has acquired the art of making allowance, from noting her sister’s exacting
              impatience; she grows confirmed in smooth acquiescence, from seeing the folly as well
              as misery of irritable and irritating opposition. . . . While Adriana frets and
              fumes, Luciana gathers composure and a philosophy of obedience. Their first colloquy
              shows this characteristically: the one all heat and anger, the other all coolness and
              propriety. Shakespeare . . . has made Luciana . . . such a woman as would make one
              of those wives considered by common-minded men as model wives; that is,
              obedient and fawning wives. Luciana is calculating, submissive, and shrewdly obedient.
              She is ultra-passive outwardly, while inwardly maintaining a perfectly self-satisfied
              independence of opinion. Moreover, like all those women of systematic yieldingness
              rather than rational yieldingness, Luciana is given to palter with truth. It
              follows . . . that a woman who makes to herself a law, a mere calculating law, of
              blind and prone submission as the best course for her own interest, inevitably
              becomes, if not a liar, yet an equivocator, a sophisticator, a prevaricator, in some
              way a deviator from straightforward truth. All the little shifts and evasions; the
              paltry tricks and petty artifices; the carnying deceptions; the amiable falsifyings
              which women who adopt implicit obedience as their stock in trade in
              wedlock allow themselves, are the necessary growth of the course they pursue. Artful
              speech [<i>526</i>] and conduct are sure to proceed from forced and
              unnatural compliance; and uniform compliance is unnatural. . . . [Quotes <a href="#tln_0791" class="ref lb">791–801</a>.]</p>

              challenge is exactly what the woman of to-day would urge. Yet in the rest of the play,
              though it is our sentimental sympathy with Luciana which has reflected on Adriana a
              deeper condemnation than has any of the formal charges laid against her, our sympathy
              with Luciana is not in the least founded on a concurrence in her explicit propositions
              about the relationship of man and wife. It is indeed Adriana who speaks with the voice
              of to-day in these matters. Why should man’s liberty than our’s be
                more? [284, slightly misquoted] she asks her sister, adding that none but
              asses will be bridled in such fashion by their husbands’ will. But this is Luciana’s
              creed: —[quotes <a href="#tln_0290" class="ref lb">290–9</a>] [<i>70</i>]. No mortal in this world of ours now would
              venture to swear by such a creed: nor could a subject of Queen Elizabeth have easily
              dared to do so. And yet though Luciana’s terms are mere relics of the past, she
              secures from the moderns more instinctive sympathy than does her sister, despite the
              almost Georgian modernity of Adriana’s views on conjugal equality. For Luciana brings
              into the play a range of sentiment utterly incompatible with the atmosphere of this
                <i>Comedy of Errors</i>. When Antipholus of Syracuse woos her as
              [quotes <a href="#tln_0850" class="ref lb">850–3</a>] he is
              putting into words a way of looking on the relationship of man and woman different
              fundamentally from the point of view expressed in Roman comedy and its English
              imitations. He summarizes the rise of romance, medieval romance embedded in
            the 16th c., and even when Sh. is recoiling from romance, he could not divest
              himself of the romantic. . . . Luciana is a singing mermaid, [<i>71</i>] spreading o’er the silver waves the echoes of her song and wisps of golden
              hair as a bed whereon her love may lie. Not even Shakespeare can make sisters of two
              such beings. They are of different family, and indeed of different race, if not of

              Unlike her blundering sister, Luciana is observant. In her loyalty she tells Adriana
              of Antipholus’s advances (IV, ii). Though shocked with their impropriety, she takes
              note of their nature and admits that, addressed to the proper person, they would be in
              very good style. In another place her observant nature is conveyed with a subtlety
              that few readers would expect of Shakespeare in so early a play. In II, ii, Adriana
              and Luciana, mistaking one Antipholus for the other, try to persuade Antipholus of
              Syracuse to enter the house and eat the long-postponed dinner. Utterly bewildered, he
              allowed himself to be persuaded and tells us so in an aside. Whereupon, Luciana cries

            81): Like Egeon, Luciana is a character for whom there is no analogue in Plautus.
              The voice of reason and tolerance in the play, sane in the midst of madness, she
              counters the possessiveness and jealous frenzy of her sister Adriana with counsels of
              generosity and patience. Her own ideal of marriage is . . . a relationship of mutual
              trust in which the woman is frankly subservient to her husband, as St. Paul believed
              she should be, but finds her own liberty and independence within this circumscription.
              It does not seem to be an ideal which Luciana has had much opportunity to see in
              practice. Faced with a nagging and suspicious sister and a brother-in-law who is
              careless of his wife’s feelings and quick to anger . . . Luciana has remained
              single, though it is assumed she will marry S. Antipholus.</p>

              from the Abbess at the end of the play, when marital relationships become the centre

              bed</i> (<a href="#tln_0301" class="ref lb">301</a>) is
              puzzling . . . mysterious, wondering if she speaks from experience as
            a widow, or whether as a decent virgin, [she is] slightly apprehensive about the
              marriage bed. About 22 of her 43 speeches are about adultery, and this
              line might be read simply as one more, oblique, allusion to her favourite
              subject. S. Antipholus’s offer in Act 5 is tepid and she [<i>111</i>] responds nothing, so we don’t know if they will marry.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            Yet Luciana must be strongly inclined . . . to accept Syracuse
              Antipholus’s offer of marriage. She seems to have very quickly become infatuated with
              him. [fn.: If it is accepted that Luciana is infatuated, there is no way of knowing
              how long she has been so before the start of the play. It is worth
              suggesting . . . that perhaps Luciana suddenly feels for Syr. Ant., while thinking
              him Eph. Ant., an affection she had not felt for the real Eph. Ant.; that is, she
              entirely unconsciously knows that Syr. Ant. is not Eph. Ant.] Only infatuation may
              satisfactorily explain the direction of some of her Act III words to Antipholus and
              her Act IV revelations to her sister. Without even infatuation to act as a partial
              justification, Luciana must appear a thoroughly Machiavellian young
              lady, participating quite by accident in a farce.

            Some of Luciana’s lines . . . could be supposed spoken by Lady Macbeth

              complicated rather than simplified by what is revealed at the opening of IV,ii.
              Luciana there reveals her brother-in-law’s proposals to his sister. For her then to
              report to Adriana, with some show of anguish and displeasure, that Antipholus is
              attempting the very thing that she herself has just counselled him to do, makes
              Luciana somewhat less than morally trustworthy. Perhaps she
              calculatingly tells her sister of Antipholus’s advances simply because she
              wants to make an ostensibly clean breast of the matter. . . . [Then] she may get on

            that this is heavy stuff. It can only be rejoined that the Luciana that [<i>113</i>] complains of the troubles of the marriage bed while yet
              unmarried and tells her own brother-in-law to try to be more exquisite in the
              deception of his wife, is for many readers and spectators a character difficult to
              understand and not easy to love.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_ornr1986" class="ref bibl">Ornstein</a> (1986,
            pp. 31–2): In the debate with Luciana Adriana has the last word because here as
              elsewhere in Shakespeare’s plays, platitudinous counsel and painted comforts shatter
              against the hard reality of suffering and anger. Moreover, Luciana is not simply a
              spokesman for conventional pieties; she knows too much about the world to have any
              illusions about the way men treat women. When Antipholus S. woos her, she is not
              horrified even though she thinks him Adriana’s husband. Indignant at his advances, she
              does not, however, threaten to expose his adulterous (indeed,
                incestuous) lust to her sister and she does not rebuff him with pious
              sentences. Instead she pleads with him to be circumspect in his philandering and
              thereby considerate of his wretched wife . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_0791" class="ref lb">791–8</a>]. On other lips this might seem
              Machiavellian advice, but Luciana’s anger shows through her seeming acceptance of the
              cynical way of the world. She knows too well the emotional dependence of women on men
              and their willingness to deceive themselves about their marriages if their husbands
              will give them half a chance: [<i>32</i>] [quotes <a href="#tln_0807" class="ref lb">807–8</a>]. It is remarkable that the
              pathos of a woman’s subservience in marriage should be made more explicit in <i>Errors</i> than any other comedy to follow.</p>

          
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_hent1986" class="ref bibl">Hennings</a> (1986,
            pp. 95 ff.) opposes the view of others—he cites <a href="#s_sig" class="ref witness">Levin</a> (ed. 1965, p. xxviii) and <a href="#b_bara1974" class="ref bibl">Barton</a>—that Luciana is the
              play’s spokesperson on the theme of marriage. But their interpretation does not
              explain the further development of Luciana’s character, her charactonymic link and
              structural parallelism to the erotic Luce, or why before the presence of Aemilia,
              Adriana rebukes the contentious Luciana and sides with the Abbess.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Though she makes the argument for obedience and the double standard, she is running
            against a growing opposition to such behavior, as e.g., the  “Homilie of
              the state of Matrimonie.”  (P. 97): Explicitly contradicting Luciana’s
              defense of the double standard, the homily defines the grand folly of human
              nature. He quotes—the gist being that men were to suppress their domineering
            and learn to be equal in affections.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 98): Furthermore, Luciana’s own confession of why she is not married
              undercuts her pose as a moral advisor. Her claim that she fears the troubles of
                the marriage-bed ([<a href="#tln_0301" class="ref lb">301</a>]) points
              to a reluctance about sexuality and the consequences of childbirth, referred to in the
              homily as griefe and paines, the paine of their
                trauailing,
              great perils, and great afflictions (p. 243 [of <i>Certaine Sermons</i>, 1968]), accurate enough when one considers the
              medical risks of the time and the number of women who died in childbirth. But
              overcoming this natural fear—that is, of being married—is the chief nobility of women,
              advises the sermon, which thereby counters the Catholic claims for celibacy.
            He quotes this is the chiefe ornament of holy matrons . . . in
                that they refused not from marriage for the businesse thereof, for the gifts and
                perils thereof . . . (p. 243). In advising her sister, Luciana does not
              uphold those ideals about marriage and the perfection of women that the original
              audience had been taught to cherish. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            It would be unwise to overlook the charactonymic link between Luce and
              Luciana. In making the commonplace observation that the scenes of Luce and Dromio
              burlesque those of Luciana and Antipholus, we may note that as the drab [!] Luce
              represents the physical level of love, the supposed natural sexual lightness of women,
              so Luciana is thematically linked to her as her [<i>99</i>] higher
              self, a secular, a social or psychological restraint upon human sexuality which proves
              ultimately ineffective in trying to control the sexual appetites. . . . 
          </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
            What is wrong with Luciana is that she here exists solely on a
              superficial secular level. She speaks to the appearances of things and sounds like
              Lady Macbeth: [quotes <a href="#tln_0798" class="ref lb">798–9</a>]. Where Luce will almost physically mount her partner, Luciana’s
              approach to sexuality more subtly reflects the deep and troubled forces of the
              concupiscible appetites. As Kenneth Muir [1979, p. 21] has observed, she is attracted
              to Antipholus; and Antipholus—suspecting as much, believing that she has taken her own
              advice and is dressing her vice as the herald of virtue—mistakenly comes to regard her
              as a clever temptress pretending to be his sister-in-law inviting him to have an
              affair with her. . . .

              focus and momentary gain in dramatic status, affect our response to Adriana? There is
              no doubt that most of the ridicule in [4.4] is directed against his attempts to
              exorcise EAntipholus’s evil spirits. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>63</i>] Shakespeare resorts to two more standard
              comic devices in order to discredit the exorcist: incongruity is one, automatism the
              other. The first [is found in] the discrepancy between self-complacency, flaunted
              learnedness, and pretentiousness and prejudice, ignorance, and blindness,
              which . . . inevitably result in one between effort and effect. Nothing could
              illustrate this incongruity more vividly than . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_1335" class="ref lb">1335–6</a>], which is answered by
            Antipholus’s blow. The second comic device . . . is what Bergson calls
                &lt;a&gt;utomatisme. . . . Pinch is in his actions guided by an
                <i>idée fixe</i>, which deprives him of
              mental (and physical) flexibility. It makes him utter empty phrases and engage in
              other automatisms. And his actions become highly predictable.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">But he gives no examples. (P. 64): To emphasize the point that Pinch’s practices
              deserve nothing but derision and contempt, let me finally look at his dramatic
              fate . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_1641" class="ref lb">1641–50</a>]. The utter relentlessness in Shakespeare’s treatment of Doctor Pinch
              leaves no doubt whatsoever that the audience, whether Elizabethan or modern, is meant
              to disapprove unconditionally of his dubious practices. His not being on stage
            in Act 5 likewise means he is to be regarded with great
              suspicion. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>65</i>] If we turn to the question of how Pinch
              affects our response to Adriana, we can discover a very paradoxical phenomenon. At
              first sight, he seems to incriminate Adriana and discredit her. After all, it is her
              decision to hire an exorcist in the first place. On the other hand Pinch soon frees
              himself from Adriana to live a dramatic life of his own, so that Shakespeare is able
              to use him as a kind of scapegoat. It is he who is blamed and finally punished for
              errors committed by other characters; he is the scapegoat that
              Shakespeare . . . sacrifices on the altar of genre expectation and persuasive
              strategies. With regard to Adriana and her predisposition to excess and impatience,
              the quack functions as some sort of safety valve, or lightning conductor. With it,
              Shakespeare can divert the reservations and objections we may still have vis-à-vis
              Adriana and direct them against the conjurer.</p>

            explores why Sh. violates genre and long dramatic custom by introducing rulers into
            comedy. He begins with a sketch of the debate gaining strength in the period as to
            whether the prince ruled under the law or above it, whether he ruled absolutely or was
            an officer of the law. He then examines <i>Err.</i>, <i>MND</i> and <i>MM.</i> (P. 10): Shakespeare improbably
              introduces [an] absolutist ideal of transcendent authority into his drama not as the
              overweening dream of a tragic or historical protagonist but as the comic desire of
              comic rulers. . . . Shakespeare represents political cultures in which independent
              legal codes impinge on the authority of rulers. Thus, among the young lovers, rustics,
              younger sons, and ethnic marginals seeking to gratify their desires, we also encounter
              rulers who would free themselves from legal limits imposed on their actions. We might
              think of these as constitutionalist comedies, for they enact the tension between the
              law and desire.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Not only does the law condemning Syracusans to fine or death oppress Egeon, but
              the same law oppresses . . . Solinus, ruler of Ephesus.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Quoting <a href="#tln_0145" class="ref lb">145–8</a>, he
            says (p. 11) Solinus’s apposition of the laws of the state and his
              crown, oath, and dignity suggests that his personal power is strictly inscribed within
              the authority of the Ephesian legal code. . . . </p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The Duke’s political status as a mere official of the law is confirmed
              by his inability to exercise that most symbolically important of all princely acts,
              the pardon. Despite his sympathy for the merchant, Solinus confesses to Egeon,
                we may pity though not pardon thee ([<a href="#tln_0100" class="ref lb">100</a>]). Indeed, Solinus strains his authority by granting
              Egeon twenty-four hours [sic] to secure his ransom.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Hence, when he does pardon Egeon, the act (p. 12) constitutes his own comic
              liberation. The law constrained Solinus’s desire.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He notes that the pardon seems superfluous, since S. Antipholus has the ransom to free
            his father. (P. 13): Shakespeare, then, stops short of making Solinus’s triumph
              over the law <i>necessary</i>; that is one reason the play does not
              constitute an endorsement of absolutism.</p>

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Comparing <i>MND</i> and <i>Err.</i> (p. 16),
              Both plays register the limits of monarchic power not only by suggesting that
              rulers are appropriate subjects for a vulgar literary form but also by figuring the
              ruler’s assertion of unimpaired power as a comic fantasy.</p>

        <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">Staging</h4>

        
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The play may be performed by 12 men and 4 boys, with, probably, a minimum of 4
          nonspeaking extras, resources well within the capabilities of whatever acting company
          performed the play, either after the establishment of the Lord Chamberlain’s men in 1594,
          or earlier, by an unknown company (Strange’s? Pembroke’s?) (<a href="#b_gura1996" class="ref bibl">Gurr</a>, 1996, pp. 59 f.). Actually
          there are 19 speaking roles, but doubling the Jailor, the Officer in 4.1 and 4.4 (and the
          silent Headsman in Act 5); the First and Second Merchant; Balthazar and the Messenger of
          Act 5; and Luce (perhaps never seen) and the Courtesan produces what would have to be the
          minimum cast of 16, 12 men and 4 boys (Act 5 calls for 13 speaking parts and the silent
          Headsman; Pinch, undoubled, and Luce do not appear). Casting 4 others would
          bring the total needed to 20.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_engj1926" class="ref bibl">Engelen</a> (1926,
          pp. 43–4) notes the technical possibility of five doublings: Solinus and the Officer in
          Act 4; Aegeon and Pinch, S. Antipholus and the Messenger in Act 5; the First Merchant and
          Angelo, and Balthazar and the Second Merchant. She doubts that Luce appears, but thinks
          she could double with Luciana. Because Engelen apparently does not count the Jailor’s four
          words in 1.1, she has 18 speaking roles, which after doubling could be played by 13
          actors. She grants that doubling S. Antipholus and the Messenger is merely possible, but
          unlikely because of the dominance of S. Antipholus’s role and the ease of other
          doublings.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_balt1927" class="ref bibl">Baldwin</a> (1927,
          chart inserted pp. 228–9) assigns the chief speaking parts to actors he knows or believes
          to be active and available to Sh. in 1588–91. He says, for example, that Sh. played
          Solinus, William Kemp played E. Dromio, Henry Cundall (his spelling) played Adriana, and
          so on. His assumption that Sh. was already a member of a stable acting company in 1588 has
          not been widely accepted. This company, he believes, played <i>Rom.</i>
          and <i>H5</i> in 1590–1. He was anticipated in this casting by <a href="#b_sarg1897" class="ref bibl">Sarrazin</a> (1897, p.
          107), who suggests that Kemp played one Dromio, Thomas Pope perhaps the other, Sh. and
          Burbage the Antipholuses—Sh. perhaps the warmer S. Antipholus—and Edward
          Alleyn played Egeon, though he knows that Alleyn belonged to Sh.’s company only in
          1593.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_rinw1968" class="ref bibl">Ringler</a> (1968, p.
          123 n.) says that <i>Err.</i> requires a minimum cast of 14 (see above),
          but does not cast the parts.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#pw_hara1969" class="ref bibl_pw">Harbage</a> (ed.
          1969, p. 31), in a table for all the plays, casts <i>Err.</i> for 11 men
          and 5 women; these are the named roles, but apparently he leaves out the Jailor,
          Messenger, and Officer.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_kint1992" class="ref bibl">King</a> (1992, p.
          80): Eight men can play eight principal and one minor male roles; five boys play
            five principal female roles. These thirteen actors speak 97% of the lines. . . . In
            minor parts, five men can play four speaking parts and seven mutes, for a total
          of 18. He counts Luce’s 11 lines as a major role, but doubles First Merchant’s 15 lines
          (in 1.2), Pinch’s 12 (4.4), and Messenger’s 14 (5.1) as minor roles. Doubling Pinch seems
          problematic because he is described with such particularity (<a href="#tln_1715" class="ref lb">1715–18</a>).</p>
        

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The play calls for three specific locales, the houses of E. Antipholus (the Phoenix), of
          the Courtesan (the Porcupine), and the abbey. Much of the action takes place in an area
          called the Mart. A stage direction reads <i>Enter Dromio
            Syra. from the Bay</i> (<a href="#tln_1073" class="ref lb">1073</a>). On the
          public stage there were two doors flanking an aperture, usually covered by a tapestry
          hanging (see <a href="#b_gura2000" class="ref bibl">Gurr &amp;
              Ichikawa</a>, 2000,  below). Presumably one of the doors
          would have to do double service as the abode of E. Antipholus or of the Courtesan and as
          the entrance to the bay, since there is no evidence of entrances through the audience to
          the stage.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">How to manage the lock-out scene (3.1) is another problem. <a href="#s_pen2" class="ref witness">Wells</a> (ed. 1972, pp.
          145–6): The location is before Antipholus of Ephesus’s house, in which his twin is
            dining with Adriana and Luciana. Dromio of Syracuse is guarding the gate, with
            instructions to let no one in. . . . At line [<a href="#tln_0651" class="ref lb">651</a>], Antipholus tries the door and finds it locked. Dromio of Syracuse speaks
            from behind the door, and so is out of sight. . . . [<i>146</i>] It may
            be that Dromio of Syracuse, Luce, and Adriana should be out of sight of the audience
            throughout the scene. But they have so much to say that this seems clumsy. Another
            possibility is that some convention should be employed whereby the audience can see both
            sets of actors, but they are understood not to see one another. There is no reason why
            Luce should not come into the presence of the on-stage party, but it is necessary that
            the Dromios should be kept apart, and that Adriana should not confront her real husband
            at this stage of the play. It may well be that the main point of bringing Luce on here
            is to have some servant other than Dromio to sustain the altercation. To have Luce throw
            the words What a coil is there, Dromio! Who are these at the gate?
            (line[s <a href="#tln_0680" class="ref lb">680–1</a>]) behind
            her to an invisible Dromio seems clumsy, and there is something to be said in favour of
            the suggestion that Luce and perhaps Adriana should enter on an upper level—the upper
            stage of the Elizabethan theatre. This may be suggested by Adriana’s statement that she
            and her supposed husband would dine <i>above</i> ([<a href="#tln_0603" class="ref lb">603</a>]). However, it sounds from line [<a href="#tln_0701" class="ref lb">701</a>: Let him knocke till it ake] as if Luce
            were expected to be able to open the door herself, rather than simply instruct Dromio to
            do so. . . . The producer is free to engineer the scene in his own way.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Last, in Act 5, S. Antipholus and his servant flee into and emerge from the abbey. How
          that was managed on the Gray’s Inn stage, described below, or on any stage fitted with
          free-standing houses which might be quite small and thus crowded with three
          actors, is a problem.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The first recorded performance was at Gray’s Inn. See , for an account of what happened on
          that occasion. Here I examine what can be known or guessed at about the staging
          itself.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Gray’s Inn hall (see diagram in <a href="#b_knam1984" class="ref bibl">Knapp &amp; Kobialka</a>, 1984, p. 74, but
          notice that the compass points east and west are reversed) measures 70′ by 34′8″,
          dimensions similar to those of two Cambridge college halls also occasionally used for
          performances, Queen’s (44′ x 27′) and Trinity (85′ x 40′) (<a href="#b_nela1994" class="ref bibl">Nelson</a>, 1994, pp. 17, 43). The hall
          featured a dais (half-pace) at the so-called upper end and a hall screen with two openings
          in its five arches at the lower end, with a gallery above it, an oriel (bay) window on the
          north side of the half-pace, and a possibly 7′-sq. fireplace roughly in the middle of the
          hall, centered on the width but about 30 feet from the upper-end wall and a little farther
          from the other end. The hall was damaged by bombs and fire during the Second World War,
          but not seriously, and with the exception of the removal of the fireplace and construction
          of a second oriel window opposite the first, it looks very much as it did in Sh.’s day,
          though the screen does not certainly date from before 1594.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Gray’s Inn mounted an elaborate revels lasting with breaks from about 12 Dec. 1594 to
          Shrove Tuesday 1595, when a final masque was performed before the queen at court. Sometime
          after 20 Dec., certainly by 28 Dec., until about 4 Jan., a stage and scaffolds (bleachers)
          were erected in the hall, and for an unknown period an elevated chair of state for the
          prince of the revels was placed on the half-pace. At his enthronement on 20 Dec.,
            The Prince, with all his Train in Order . . . took his place in his Throne,
            under a rich Cloth of State: His Counsellors and great Lords were placed about him, and
            before him; below the Half-pace, at a Table, sate his learned Council and
            Lawyers (<i>Gesta Grayorum</i>, the account of the revels, ed.
          Bland, 1968, p. 13).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_nela1994 #b_nela1992" class="ref bibl">Nelson</a> (1992 and 1994) shows that college halls likewise employed
          scaffolds ranged along the walls, above the screen in the gallery, and sometimes against
          the upper-end wall overlooking the stage. Performances in these halls were on a stage that
          covered the dais, not apparently the way Gray’s Inn hall was configured, but otherwise
          useful for comparison. The timbers that transformed the halls into theaters were used over
          a period of many years, put up and taken down whenever occasion demanded. Plays had been
          performed at Gray’s Inn—<i>Jocasta</i> and <i>Supposes</i> in 1566 and <i>The Misfortunes of Arthur</i> perhaps
          in 1587—so Gray’s may have had what Nelson calls a demountable stage and seating. At the
          mock trial following the disaster of overcrowding and near riot on 28 Dec., the
            Sorcerer or Conjuror who had presumably arranged for <i>Err.</i> to be played was charged because he had caused the Stage to be
            built, and Scaffolds to be reared to the top of the House, to increase
            Expectation (<i>Gesta Grayorum</i>, ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 32,
          70). This charge could either point to a new construction—very expensive—or, considering
              <i>the</i> Stage, not <i>a</i> Stage,
          to the erection of a demountable one. In any event, the stage and scaffolding were taken
          down on the command of the (p. 70) Readers and Ancients of the House, by reason of
            the Term, to free up space the lawyers and students needed for eating.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_knam1984" class="ref bibl">Knapp &amp; Kobialka</a> (1984) believe that the stage was erected in the
          space between the half-pace and the fireplace, a stage (p. 77) about nine feet deep
            and as wide as the hall, that is, thirty-four feet, eight inches. This is a
          depth close to the 10′2″ at Queen’s (<a href="#b_nela1994" class="ref bibl">Nelson</a>, 1994, p. 29) but quite shallow. Nelson judges that the
          stages in Cambridge were six feet high, but might vary from hall to hall. The space in
          front of the stage between the fireplace and the hall screen, with the scaffolding aligned
          along both sides, was left open for the frequent dancing that formed part of the revelry.
          Such a position for the stage meant that at least half the audience saw the play from the
          rear, though the height of the scaffolding where they sat (to the top of the
            House) improved sight lines; besides, actors were accustomed to playing to three
          or four sides of the public stage. Entrance to the stage could be through the door at the
          right rear of the half-pace, though actors would have to squeeze past the audience seated
          around the prince; or through the doors in the screen, forcing them to walk half the
          length of the hall and climb to the stage. Or they might wait in the tiring houses
          described below, if Gray’s Inn had such structures. <a href="#b_hotl1954" class="ref bibl">Hotson</a> (1954, facing p. 136) has a
          reconstruction of Whitehall that anticipates Knapp &amp; Kolbialka in some features,
          especially the staging in the middle of the hall and the use of the bleachers.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_mahm2000" class="ref bibl">Mahood</a> (2000, p.
          36) favors entrances and exits at the dais end.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_nela1994" class="ref bibl">Nelson</a> (1994, p.
          108) demonstrates that cloth houses were used on the Cambridge stages,
          sometimes in clearly facing pairs. He also shows (pp. 24–9) that the
          Queen’s and Trinity College stages had tiring houses integrated into the stage at the left
          and right ends, straightforward three-storey structures, measuring
          (Queen’s) 11′2″ by 4′8″. Something similar seems to have characterized the Gray’s Inn
          stage. On 3 Jan. another large company gathered to be entertained. <i>Gesta
            Grayorum</i> (ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 35–6): When they were all thus
            placed and setled in very good Order, the Prince came into the Hall [from the screen
            end] with his wonted State, and ascended his Throne at the high End of the Hall, under
            His Highness’s Arms; and after him came the Ambassador of <i>Templaria</i>, with his Train likewise [and were duly seated]. Then, after variety
            of Musick, they were presented with this Device.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          At the side of the Hall, behind a Curtain, was erected an Altar to the
            Goddess of Amity; her Arch-Flamen, ready to attend the Sacrifice and Incense that
            should, by her Servants, be offered unto her: Round about the same sate Nymphs and
            Fairies, with Instruments of Musick, and made very pleasant Melody with Viols and
            Voices, and sang Hymns and Praises to her Deity.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Then issued forth of another Room the first pair of Friends . . . [who]
            offered Incense upon the Altar to [<i>36</i>] their Goddess.
          Those two Friends, as they are called in <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>, are
          followed by eight more characters in the masque, which celebrates the renewed friendship
          of Gray’s Inn and the Inner Temple. At each side of the hall, behind curtains, there must
          have been enough space to enclose at least ten masquers. The oriel window on the north
          side of the half-pace juts out 4′7″, running from the floor to midway up the wall; it
          would suggest itself as an acting space save that it is an extension of the dais, where
          the dignitaries are seated, and it lacks its counterpart across the dais on the south
          side.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_kerg1944" class="ref bibl">Kernodle</a> (1944,
          p. 133) describes staging of four plays presented in the Inns of Court, <i>Gorboduc</i> (1561 at the Inner Temple), <i>Jocasta</i> (1566 at
          Gray’s), <i>Gismond of Salerne</i> (1567 at the Inner Temple), and
            <i>The Misfortunes of Arthur</i> (1587 perhaps at Gray’s). All four
          need two side doors and a centered acting space. Of <i>Jocasta</i> he
          writes: [It] had the most interesting façade of all . . . a façade in the
            centuries old pattern of a central castle gate flanked by two side doors. Here the
            central castle was the palace doorway of Jocasta; and of <i>The
            Misfortunes of Arthur</i>, produced just seven years before <i>Err</i>: A complex background even more like the public stage façade was
            used. Two entranceways . . . served as the houses of Mordred and of Arthur . . . ; and
            a third entrance is spoken of at one moment as the cloister of the nuns,
          reminding us of the abbey in <i>Err.</i> These stages fit well enough
          with those <a href="#b_nela1994" class="ref bibl">Nelson</a>
          describes and offer the same problems of just who got to see what if the plays were staged
          as <a href="#b_knam1984" class="ref bibl">Knapp &amp; Kobialka</a> propose, rather than at one or the other end of the
          hall, as I think most discussions assume. There is the added fact that now only one door
          opens to the dais; the east wall has been paneled and I find no evidence that another door
          used to exist.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">At the 300th-anniversary production at Gray’s, 14 Dec. 1895, the stage was set at the
          screen end, using the two doors. At the 400th anniversary, the stage was set along the
          lower end of the north wall, the gallery, and the screen—a right-angle set.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_hodc0001" class="ref bibl">Hodges</a> (in <a href="#s_cam4" class="ref witness">Dorsch</a>, ed. 1988, p.
          27) illustrates a stage built over the dais. The throne for the revels prince is on stage
          at the right, surrounded by courtiers, and another group of courtiers is opposite; the
          action of the play takes place in the constricted remainder of the stage. At the rear of
          the stage is an arras hiding the tiring house and at the front are steps leading from the
          floor of the hall to the stage, which is about three feet high.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Using the same illustration, <a href="#b_hodc1999" class="ref bibl">Hodges</a> (1999, p. 150) says of the lock-out scene: Though this may
            be staged in any number of fanciful ways, in fact the only article of scenery that is
            really needed . . . is the door itself. It should be remembered that the Chamberlain’s
            Men had mounted this play at Gray’s Inn at very short notice. With no time at all to
            make special arrangements, I suggest they simply brought themselves and their costumes
            with one property door across from Bankside to Gray’s Inn, and with only the clearing of
            some space on the stage everything was thus ready for them. For this scene, on cue, two
            of their tire men carried in and held the door as needed. His solution is very
          attractive but, as he admits, he has reduced the number of spectators on stage from those
          implied in <i>Gesta</i> (see )
          and has retained, in front of the dais, the table, which almost certainly was removed.
          Hodges does not address the <a href="#b_knam1984" class="ref bibl">Knapp &amp; Kobialka</a> proposal.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In illustrating the stages in Cambridge University colleges, <a href="#b_nela1994" class="ref bibl">Nelson</a> (1994, pp. 17, 41) apparently
          shows the dais as covered by the stage, but he says only that the stages were
            near the upper end of the hall.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The interest in these structures lies particularly in how to stage the lock-out of E.
          Antipholus in Act 3 and the entry into and return from the abbey in Act 5. Fabric houses
          arranged across the stage would block the view of that part of audience seated below the
          raised stage unless the houses were set up as clearly facing pairs (<a href="#b_nela1994" class="ref bibl">Nelson</a>, 1994, p. 108)
          at the ends of the stage. Perhaps such structures could be semipermanent features of the
          demountable stage. Tiring houses fitted with doors and possibly windows on an upper level
          would answer many questions about staging those two scenes.</p>

        
        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It used to be thought that plays might be staged using the screen as a tiring–house
          facade. But <a href="#b_nela1992" class="ref bibl">Nelson</a>
          (1992, pp. 69–70) makes these objections: First, halls of all kinds were
            constructed with social hierarchies in mind. Normally, the higher orders sat at the
            higher end, the lower orders at the lower end. The logical place for performances was
            the space just in front of or at the sides of the high table. A performance at the lower
            end of the hall would be less accessible to the head of household and to guests seated
            on the dais at the upper end of the hall, and might well be thought to violate
            proprieties. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          Second, the screens served as the principal entrance to the hall [<i>70</i>] for the majority of guests, especially those of lower rank.
            Staging a play hard against the screens would either block this normal means of access
            and egress, or would restrict the stage platform to the width of the space between the
            doors. Further, a platform erected in front of the screen doors not only might block the
            normal swing of the doors, but would take an inch from the height of the door opening
            for every inch of the height of the stage. A five-foot stage would require a ten-foot
            door to make a five-foot entrance. . . .

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          Third, hall screens in late Tudor times were ornately decorated: it is
            difficult to believe that they were routinely and deliberately subjected to the hard use
            virtually inevitable in the course of a dramatic performance.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_cam4" class="ref witness">Dorsch</a> (ed. 1988,
          pp. 23–4), believing that there were five handsome arched doorways in the
          screen, proposes a staging at the screen end (p. 24): The three inner
            doors . . . would have served admirably as the entrances to the houses of Antipholus
            and the Courtesan, and to the priory. The two outer doors could well have been left open
            to represent the ways leading to the port and the city. Gray’s Inn hall screen
          has, however, always had just two doors (and it is not certain that the present screen was
          in place in 1594 [<a href="#b_capl1988" class="ref bibl">Caplan</a>, 1988]). Dorsch’s proposal is wholly accepted by <a href="#b_riew1990" class="ref bibl">Riehle</a> (1990, p. 21)
          and provisionally accepted by <a href="#b_gura2000" class="ref bibl">Gurr &amp; Ichikawa</a> (2000, pp. 102–3). <a href="#b_mahm2000" class="ref bibl">Mahood</a> (2000, p. 55

          (2002, p. 168 n.) confirm that the screen has always had two doors.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Once one has hypothesized about staging under the unusual circumstances at Gray’s Inn, a
          question arises about what Sh. had in mind when he conceived the play, and this is a
          question that is connected to the unsettled question of when he wrote it. His casting of
          the play, including the characters he added to Plautus’s play, argues that he knew what
          resources he had available to him. If he wrote <i>Err.</i> specifically
          for its first performance at Gray’s Inn in 1594, counting on staging methods (including
          three houses) that would allow him a classical flavor, then the report in
            <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> that the performance was huddled together at a
          moment’s notice is a palpable fiction (which it may indeed be). <i>Err.</i> was also played at court in 1604, and most likely in the public
          playhouses. Elizabethan staging was nothing if not flexible, but in what follows scholars
          openly or implicitly choose only one of the alternatives.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_cam3a" class="ref witness">Wilson</a> (ed. 1922,
          pp. 81–2, 98): The chief difficulty . . . is to determine the relative positions
            of the Mart and the house of Antipholus. At times they seem some distance apart, at
            times they are close together, if not in the same locality. . . . We have come to the
            conclusion that the most satisfactory arrangement for a modern reader’s text is to
            alternate between two localities: (i) an open space before the house of Antipholus,
            which will have the priory on one side and a street-exit on the other, and (ii) the
            Mart, which will have the Courtesan’s house in the centre and street-exits, one of them
            leading to the bay, on either side. We believe too that those responsible for the text,
            as we have it, kept those two localities more or less in mind, distinguishing them at
            the time of performance by means of placards, when necessary. Evidently the play was to
            be acted upon a simple platform with three doors at the back, and no
            inner-stage. He goes through the scenes, showing what placards would have to be
          erected. Possibly the three doors . . . were simply the entrances to the painted
              houses which are known to have been used on the academic and court
            stage; [<i>82</i>] but it is not necessary to our argument to suppose
            this, since the bare dais of a hall, with three doors at the back, would
            serve. . . . The obvious necessity for an upper-stage in 3.1., a scene which must have
            lost much of its effect when played in a hall without a gallery . . . suggest[s] that
            [Sh.] had the ordinary Elizabethan stage in mind throughout. (P. 98, on <a href="#tln_0679" class="ref lb">679</a>): In a public playhouse, for which
            this scene is clearly arranged, S. Dromio would be within i.e. behind the
            door or curtain at the back of the inner-stage, while Luce and Adriana would appear on
            the balcony which overhangs the inner-stage. All previous edd. have placed the two women
              within with S. Dromio. Such an arrangement is extremely awkward from
            the theatrical point of view, since the audience would be greatly puzzled by three
            unseen characters, more especially as one of them appears nowhere else in the play. Luce
            and Adriana, on the upper-stage, could be seen by the audience without themselves seeing
            E. Dromio and E. Antipholus, who would be at the door out of sight under the balcony. On
            the other hand at a performance such as that at Gray’s Inn . . . where no inner-stage
            and probably no balcony would be available, the three characters would have to be
              within. Gray’s Inn hall has a balcony over the screen end, but
          Wilson seems to envision the dais as the stage. Gray’s Inn hall has only a single door
          opening to the dais.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_chae1930" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> (1930,
          1:307–8): Probably the stage was set in the same way throughout. At the back of the
            stage three houses or doors represented to the right and left the Priory with some
            religious emblem over it, and the Courtesan’s house with the sign of the Porpentine, and
            in the centre the house of Antipholus with the sign of the Phoenix. As Wilson [ed. 1922,
            p. 98] points out, Adriana [<i>308</i>] and Luce must here appear
              above in iii. I. There is no other action above and none within; all is
            either at the doors of the houses, or in an open place, often referred to as the
              mart. The mart scenes were played at the front of the stage, and the
            side entrances were supposed to lead to the bay and to the town respectively. But while
            characters sometimes seem to move direct from the mart to the houses, there are also
            passages which suggest that they go off the stage on the way between these. Such
            inconsistencies would probably not be much felt in a bustling action.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_alep1939" class="ref bibl">Alexander</a> (1939,
          pp. 68–9), arguing that Sh. did not have the Elizabethan stage in mind, but rather that of
          classic convention: One side entrance leads to the Bay, the other to the Town. This
            was the proper classic setting for the stage, since the Comedy, which was Shakespeare’s
            model, was born at Athens between [<i>69</i>] the Bay and the Town. And
            the courtesy of convention allowed Comedy to enjoy the advantages she was born to, even
            in cities where they were unsanctioned by the laws of nature. Plautus in his <i>Amphitruo</i> gives a harbour to Thebes.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_grew1954" class="ref bibl">Greg</a> (1942; 1954,

            from the Bay,
            to the Priory,
            to the Abbess point clearly to a set stage with three houses and
            entrances between. The play cannot therefore have been written for the public theatre,
            and in fact the earliest recorded performance was on 28 Dec. 1594 at Gray’s
          Inn.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed. 1962,
          pp. xxxiv ff.): <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is unique
            among Shakespeare’s plays in the way localities are indicated . . . ; it seems to
            require only four playing-areas, or at the most five, three of which were clearly marked
            by signs [i.e., placards]. These localities are the street ([<a href="#tln_0659" class="ref lb">659</a>] etc.) or mart ([<a href="#tln_0239" class="ref lb">239</a>], etc.), presumably the main playing area
            of the stage; the house of Antipholus of Ephesus, called the Phoenix ([<a href="#tln_0240" class="ref lb">240</a>]); the house of the Courtesan, called the
            Porpentine (i.e. Porcupine, [<a href="#tln_0777" class="ref lb">777</a>]); and the
            Priory which houses the Abbess ([<a href="#tln_1502" class="ref lb">1502</a>]). It
            is possible that an upper storey or gallery in the house of Antipholus was also used
              ([<a href="#tln_0603" class="ref lb">603</a> . . . ; <a href="#tln_0679" class="ref lb">679</a>]), [<i>xxxv</i>] but is not essential to
            the play’s action. The evidence of the text points to one conclusion [he quotes <a href="#b_chae1930" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a> on the
            three houses]. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The text indicates a continuous action on a stage with three fixed
            locations, which could have been houses, shallow structures from which
            characters could speak or make entries. The use of houses . . . was
            common in Court productions, and standard practice in the dramaturgy of Lyly, from whom
            Shakespeare learned much in writing his play. However, Shakespeare may also have had in
            mind the traditions of Gray’s Inn, if <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> was
            written for performance there. For the educated gentlemen of the Inns of Court were
            familiar with the conventionalized arcade setting with which Renaissance editors
            illustrated editions of Terence and Plautus, apparently in the belief that they were
            imitating the Roman stage. In these arcades, each compartment would represent a house or
              domus, and it seems that staging at the Inns of Court followed this
            pattern [quotes <a href="#b_kerg1944" class="ref bibl">Kernodle</a>, above]. . . . [<i>xxxvi</i>] All these
            [plays] had three fixed locations, and an arcade with three doors such as that used for
              <i>Jocasta</i> and possibly for <i>The Misfortunes of
              Arthur</i> would have served admirably for <i>The Comedy of
              Errors</i>, which seems to call for exactly this kind of setting.

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He quotes <a href="#b_alep1939" class="ref bibl">Alexander</a> (above). This is a reasonable suggestion, but I
            do not think we need suppose that Shakespeare had read Vitruvius, or realized what was a
              proper classic setting; his reading of Plautus would have been enough,
            for <i>Menaechmi</i> and <i>Amphitruo</i> clearly
            indicate a harbour and a city. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          However, the indications in stage-directions and within the text all
            suggest a simple staging of a special kind. It is tempting to suppose that this short
            play, with its classical background, was designed for performance in a hall with no
            gallery, and for an audience used to houses on stage, and perhaps
            familiar with the [<i>xxxvii</i>] kind of arcade setting to be seen in
            several editions of Terence.

          but observes that notions of Elizabethan staging have become simplified since 1922—an
          overhanging balcony and an inner stage with door at the rear are no longer believed to
          have existed. He wonders whether one or more stage doors included a wicket or
            aperture in the upper part, as seems to be suggested by the jesting cry of Dromio of
            Syracuse to his [<i>xxxviii</i>] twin, Either get thee from this
              door, or sit down at the hatch ([<a href="#tln_0655" class="ref lb">655</a>] . . . ). The aperture may have been a half-door, or at least large enough
            for several figures to be visible to the audience, and Luce certainly appears from the
            dialogue to be located within the door . . . [quotes <a href="#tln_0692" class="ref lb">692</a>, <a href="#tln_0698" class="ref lb">698</a>]. In
            addition, there is little evidence for the use of a gallery here; at [<a href="#tln_0603" class="ref lb">603–4</a>] Adriana says Husband, I’ll dine above with you to-day, <br/>And shrive you of a thousand idle
              pranks, but it is doubtful whether this can be taken literally as referring to
            the stage. . . . [<i>xxxix</i>] It seems to me that Luce and Adriana
            are meant to be visible to the audience in this scene, while apparently, or in
            supposition, remaining concealed from Antipholus of Ephesus and his companions, and that
            this could be more easily and convincingly staged by using a structure on stage than by
            placing the mistress and her maid on a balcony.</p>

            same doors throughout the performance, for not only the three houses but also the
            standard entryways had to be represented by the three entries of the tiring-house wall.
            The doors for entrances and exits in this play are uniquely odd and distinctive. It does
            seem most likely that each house was represented by the same door at least throughout
            each scene when the three locations were in use.</p>

            Porpentine, and in accord with the fast-extending complications has no one focal point:
            the action is related by turns to the Phoenix, the Porpentine, and neither. The third

          pp. 108–9): If we turn to neoclassic tradition [from Tudor drama and royal
            and civic entertainment] . . . with its emphasis on ambiguity and surprise, we find
            Shakespeare using the stage façade to frame a world of illusion, escape, and rebellion
            against authority. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          If, as seems likely, Shakespeare began his exploration of such liminal
            spatial relationships in <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, his indebtedness
            to neoclassic theater is clear enough. In modified form he seems to have [<i>109</i>] adopted the model set forth in <i>Ralph Roister
              Doister</i> and <i>Gammer Gurton’s Needle</i>, for example,
            where two or more houses face on a street scene throughout the play. Shakespeare
            evidently intends one stage door to represent the dwelling of Antipholus of Ephesus
            throughout, with the Abbey near at hand and represented by another door. What attracts
            Shakespeare to such a setting is not the verisimilar scenic effect—there is no
            indication that scenery or stage housing was used in the original production—but rather
            the spatial interconnection of the main stage and the space lying within. The stage
            façade becomes a part of Shakespeare’s comedy of illusion and misunderstanding, much as
            it must have done on Plautus’ and Terence’s stage before him. Antipholus of Ephesus
            arrives at one point to find his house door—presumably a door in the tiring-house
            façade—locked against him. He and his servant . . . call in vain to those in the house,
            who speak apparently from within. When Luce and then Adriana enter and
            yet are presumed to be still inside the house, they may be visible to the audience as
            they stand in the gallery or some such acting area, out of sight of the frustrated
            master and his servant on the main stage ([<a href="#tln_0680" class="ref lb">680–705</a>]). The façade thus expresses misunderstanding and
            inversion between husband and wife and between servant and servant; it is a device of
            complication.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          Later in the play . . . this same façade becomes the means of revelation
            and discovery. It is through the stage door representing the Abbey that the Abbess
            emerges with Antipholus and Dromio of Syracusa to undeceive all those who have begun to
            question their own sanity. The actors’ tiring-house contains all secrets and eventually
            explains all mysteries; with its two or more doors, it is at once the source of comic
            confusion and eventual clarification. The apertures into the façade are not, on
            Shakespeare’s illusionistic stage, simply a means of allowing characters to appear from
            and disappear into an understood offstage location; they stress a duality between what
            is seen and unseen, between what a character supposes to be within and what in fact is
            to be found there. The stage façade is an essential source of illusion in the liminal
            world of Shakespeare’s first comedy of mistaken identities.

          Adriana is deaf, and idiotic into the bargain, to insist that another man was [her]
            husband; similarly <a href="#b_dupp1828" class="ref bibl">Duport</a> (1828, 2:266). <a href="#b_scha1815" class="ref bibl">Schlegel</a> (1809–11; tr. 1815, 2:158): In such pieces we
            must, to give to the senses at least an appearance of truth, always pre-suppose that the
            parts by which the misunderstandings are occasioned are played with masks, and this the
            poet no doubt observed.
          <a href="#b_flef1876" class="ref bibl">Fleay</a> (1876, p.
          25): It is seldom acted, the extreme difficulty of obtaining two pairs of actors
            sufficiently like to realize the errors enough for modern taste being
            insurmountable.</p>

          117) disagrees with <a href="#b_hazw1817" class="ref bibl">Hazlitt</a>, though he confesses never to have seen the play: It
            appears to us that every one of an <i>audience</i> . . . who keeps his
            eyes open, will, after he has become a little familiar with the persons of [the two sets
            of twins], find out some clue by which he can detect a difference between each.
          He quotes <a href="#b_scha1815" class="ref bibl">Schlegel</a>
          above on masks. Whether masks, properly so called, were used in Shakspere’s time in
            the representation of this play, we have some doubt. But . . . each pair of persons
            selected to play the twins must be of the same height . . . and be dressed with
            apparently perfect similarity. But let every care be taken to make the deception
            perfect, and yet the observing spectator will detect a difference between each; some
            peculiarity of the voice, some trick o’ the eye, some dissimilarity in
            gait, some minute variation in dress.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_haic1978" class="ref bibl">Haines</a> (1978, p.
          109) worries about just how identically the twins are to be costumed: If they are
            dressed identically, the other characters are at least partially justified in their
            mistakes and confusions (although it is not easy to justify a wife’s failing to
            recognize her own husband at intimate range); but, too, if they are dressed identically
            (and two sets of actors have been found who will prove indistinguishable), the audience
            will themselves be confused for at least a part of the evening. Is it well, the director
            must decide, to have the audience know something that the characters on the stage do not
            know? Is it funnier? . . . How is it, too, that the Antipholi, and the Dromii, speak
            exactly alike, with no trace of a foreign accent to betray them? These
            matters are the stuff of which farce is made.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Others who comment on the staging of the play are <a href="#b_strt1965" class="ref bibl">Stroup</a> (1965, p. 100): Though one
          doesn’t expect pageantry and ceremony in Roman-based comedies, a half-dozen entrances and
          exits require formation, four of them being the Duke and his
            attendants. The pageantry and ceremony occur in material Sh. added to his Roman
          sources. <a href="#b_wels1966" class="ref bibl">Wells</a>
          (1966, p. 107) on the subdued ending of <i>Err.</i>, not the promised
          gossips’ feast: But the actual ending of most of the comedies is subdued in tone.
            This fact is of course inseparable from practical considerations. The Elizabethan
            theatre had no curtain to fall on a festive tableau.
          <a href="#b_cham1971" class="ref bibl">Charney</a> (1971, pp.
          21–2) considers the stage properties, the bag of gold, the chain, rope’s end, diamond
          ring, that visually define the play’s distinctive mercantile atmosphere. <a href="#b_holm1972" class="ref bibl">Holmes</a> (1972, p. 36):
            The parts of Adriana . . . , Helena in <i>A Midsummer Night’s

              Shrew</i> call for a player who can be at the same time genuinely pitiable and
            slightly absurd.
          <a href="#b_wilj1982" class="ref bibl">Williams</a> (1982,
          pp. 34 ff.) offers as one staging plan a neo-classic design based on 15th-
          and 16th-c. illustrations of Terence and Plautus, as in <a href="#s_ard2" class="ref witness">Foakes</a> (ed. 1962, pp. xxxviii f.), as
          well as other contemporary paintings. The set has the abbey on the left, the Porcupine on
          the right, the Phoenix next to it, and in the center a thrust out blank section with
          gallery above and a centered window (optional, depending on how the lock-out scene is
          played). He recommends costumes based on those illustrations.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">1594Gray’s Inn and <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>. The
          first recorded performance of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is that at
          Gray’s Inn on 28 Dec., Holy Innocents’ Day, 1594, recorded in the <i>Gesta
            Grayorum</i>, which was published in 1688. In May and June 1594 the Admiral’s men
          and the Chamberlain’s men were formed to make some order out of the chaotic playing
          conditions caused in part by the extended closure of the London acting houses during the
          plague of mid 1592–mid 1594. The Admiral’s company played at court on 28 Dec. (<a href="#b_chae1923" class="ref bibl">Chambers</a>, 1923,
          4:109), freeing Sh.’s company, themselves at court on the two previous nights, to play at
          Gray’s Inn. <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> implies that the actors were called on
          the spur of the moment to calm what looked to be turning into a riot. If so, what good
          fortune to have a short Plautine comedy at hand. Here is the report of the event (ed.
          Bland, 1968, pp. 29–34): The next grand Night was intended to be upon <i>Innocents-Day</i> at Night; at which time there was a great Presence of
            Lords, Ladies, and worshipful Personages, that did expect some notable Performance at
            that time; which, indeed, had been effected, if the multitude of Beholders had not been
            so exceeding great, that thereby there was no convenient room for those that were
            Actors; by reason whereof, very good Inventions and Conceipts could not have opportunity
            to be applauded, which otherwise would have been great Contentation to the
            Beholders. About 9:00 p.m. the Inner Temple sent an ambassador with a large
          entourage to pay a formal visit to the mock prince of Purpoole, Henry Helmes, a law
          student, and was conducted to a (p. 30) Chair besides His Highness, to the end that
            he might be Partaker of the Sports intended. Polite speeches followed,
          emphasizing the long friendship between the Temple and Gray’s Inn.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">(P. 31): When the Ambassador was placed, as aforesaid, and that
            there was something to be performed for the Delight of the Beholders, there arose such a
            disordered Tumult and Crowd upon the Stage, that there was no Opportunity to effect that
            which was intended: There came so great a number of worshipful Personages upon the
            Stage, that might not be displaced; and Gentlewomen, whose Sex did privilege them from
            Violence, that when the Prince and his Officers had in vain, a good while, expected and
            endeavoured a Reformation, at length there was no hope of Redress for that present. The
            Lord Ambassador and his Train thought that they were not so kindly entertained, as was
            before expected, and thereupon would not stay any longer at that time, but, in a sort,
            discontented and displeased. After their Departure the Throngs and Tumults did somewhat
            cease, although so much of them continued, as was able to disorder and confound any good
            Inventions whatsoever. In regard whereof, as also for that the Sports intended were
            especially for the gracing of the <i>Templarians</i>, it was thought
            good not to offer any thing of Account, [<i>32</i>] saving Dancing and
            Revelling with Gentlewomen; and after such Sports, a Comedy of Errors (like to <i>Plautus</i> his <i>Menechmus</i>) was played by the
            Players. So that Night was begun, and continued to the end, in nothing but Confusion and
            Errors; whereupon, it was ever afterwards called, <i>The Night of
              Errors</i>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The uproar led the Lawyers of the Prince’s Council to set up a mock court
          of inquiry concerning some great Disorders and Abuses lately done and
            committed with[in] his Highness’s Dominions of <i>Purpoole</i>,
            especially by Sorceries and Inchantments; and namely, of a great Witchcraft used the
            Night before, whereby there were great Disorders and Misdemeanours, by Hurly-burlies,
            Crowds, Errors, Confusions, vain Representations and Shews, to the utter Discredit of
            our State and Policy.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The next Night upon this Occasion, we preferred Judgments thick and
            threefold, which were read publickly by the Clerk of the Crown, being all against a
            Sorcerer or Conjurer that was supposed to be the Cause of that confused Inconvenience.
            Therein was contained, How he had caused the Stage to be built, and Scaffolds to be
            reared to the top of the House, to increase Expectation. He is also charged with
          inviting throngs to the party, disgracing the Templars, and disappointing them of the
          expected entertainments. Also that he caused Throngs and Tumults, [<i>33</i>] Crowds and Outrages, to disturb our whole Proceedings. And
            Lastly, that he had foisted a Company of base and common Fellows, to make up our
            Disorders with a Play of Errors and Confusions; and that that Night had gained to us
            Discredit, and it self a Nickname of Errors. All which were against the Crown and
            Dignity of our Sovereign Lord, the Prince of <i>Purpoole</i>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The prisoner was allowed to make a petition explaining his actions, wherein was a
            Disclosure of all the Knavery and Juggling of the Attorney and Sollicitor, which had
            brought all this Law-stuff on purpose to blind the Eyes of his Excellency, and all the
            honourable Court there, going about to make them think, that those things which they all
            saw and perceived sensibly to be in very deed done, and actually performed, were nothing
            else but vain Illusions, Fancies, Dreams and Enchantments, and to be wrought and [<i>34</i>] compassed by the Means of a poor harmless Wretch, that never
            had heard of such great Matters in all his Life: Whereas the very Fault was in the
            Negligence of the Prince’s Council, Lords and Officers of his State, that had the Rule
            of the Roast, and by whose Advice the Commonwealth was so soundly mis-governed.
          He makes irrefutable countercharges against the grandees. But the Prince
            and States-men (being pinched on both sides, by both the Parties) were not a little
            offended at the great Liberty that they had taken, in censuring so far of His Highness’s
            Government; and thereupon the Prisoner was freed and pardoned, the Attorney, Sollicitor,
            Master of Requests, and those that were acquainted with the Draught of the Petition,
            were all of them commanded to the Tower; so the Lieutenant took charge of them. And this
            was the End of our Law-sports, concerning the Night of Errors.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">When we were wearied with mocking thus at our own
            Follies, at length there was a great Consultation had for the Recovery of our lost
            Honour. Plans are made to perform divers plots and devices on 3 Jan., with
          provisions made to keep out gate crashers and otherwise to ensure order.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">How to understand these events? On 28 Dec. a notable Performance was made
          impossible because worshipful Personages and Gentlewomen
          invaded the specially erected stage to such a degree that there was no convenient
            room for those that were Actors; the Templarian guests took offense and
          departed; order was mostly restored, and dancing and reveling, followed by a performance
          of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, were substituted, substitutions that
          were not . . . any thing of Account in comparison to what had been
          planned. The Actors seem not to be the same as the Players,
          later called a Company of base and common Fellows, though it is just
          possible that the notable Performance was <i>The Comedy of
            Errors</i>, not substituted but merely delayed until the rather small stage could be
          cleared for performance (<a href="#b_smib1997" class="ref bibl">Smith</a> [1997, p. 102]: The first recorded
            performance . . . almost didn’t happen). The embarrassment caused by the near
          riot led to the events of the succeeding days.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Is <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> an eyewitness report of an event that went
          badly wrong, leading to ad hoc substitutions of wholly different, planned entertainments,
          followed the next day by a hastily convened arraignment and trial of someone who was to
          blame for not controlling the evening better and for having, without planning, assembled
          the Lord Chamberlain’s men, well after 9 p.m., to play <i>Err.</i> on
          what was perhaps an unfamiliar stage with no opportunity for familiarizing themselves with
          the physical attributes of that stage? Or is the whole account a fiction, one that
          pretends there was such mismanagement and such good fortune, followed by a mock
          arraignment and freeing of the prisoner? No one has put <i>Gesta
            Grayorum</i> under much scrutiny, though <a href="#b_quia1922" class="ref bibl">Quiller-Couch</a> (in <a href="#s_cam3a" class="ref witness">Wilson</a>, ed. 1922, p. x) doubts that its
          account is trustworthy: We doubt then that it [the ad hoc substitution of <i>Err.</i>] was a makeshift: we suspect rather that it was pre-arranged;
            that the players had been pre-empted from Greenwich to present just such an extravaganza
            upon Plautus as would tickle the scholarly taste and amuse the serious
              lawyers amid their bowers. The reference to Greenwich alludes to a
          probably mistaken report of payment to the Chamberlain’s men for a performance at court on
          28 Dec. 1594; see . Bland (ed. 1968, <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>, p. xiii n.), denying <a href="#b_hotl1954" class="ref bibl">Hotson</a> (1954, p. 50), who supposes
          the interruption and its consequences were planned: This was certainly not the case
            here, whatever may have happened on other occasions. The record leaves no doubt that the
            disorders were quite unexpected.
          <a href="#s_cam4" class="ref witness">Dorsch</a> (ed. 1988,
          p. 28) believes the Actors were members of Gray’s Inn, and the
            Players were the Chamberlain’s men, who had been purposely engaged for

          <a href="#b_hura1996" class="ref bibl">Hurley</a> (1996, pp.
          103 ff.) studies the role of interruption in court and festive rituals,
          specifically in the plays and entertainments at the Inns of Court, whose purpose was to
          help students learn how (p. 112) to adjust to disruptions occasioned by collisions
            of status and power, a regular feature of late Renaissance court life. Noting
          Hotson and <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> (ed. Bland), p. 114: I suspect
            that the truth lies somewhere between the arranged and the completely
            spontaneous. . . . Specific interruptions might indeed arise spontaneously, but the
            patterns they assumed [<i>115</i>] were derived from previously existing
            social arrangements they then both reflected and modified.
          <a href="#b_smib1997" class="ref bibl">Smith</a> (1997, pp.
          103, 108, 118): Reinserted into the social context in which it was given
            its first recorded performance, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> offers
            itself as a particularly revealing document about what it meant to be male—for one
            privileged group of men, at least—in early modern England. . . . </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>108</i>] Whether or not <i>The Comedy
              of Errors</i> was written specifically for performance at Gray’s Inn has been the
            subject of philological inquiry for some time. From the standpoint of cultural
            anthropology, however, it doesn’t really matter which is the chicken and which the egg.
            More important is the fact that <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> and the
              <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> that occasioned its first recorded performance
            constitute . . . a single piece of social process. He studies the two documents
          to show them as describing a rite of passage involving such matters as adolescent
          anxieties about identity, the emphasis in both on sexuality, and adult assurances,
          including (p. 118) in the end, both play and pageants find a place for women that
            supports rather than threatens male identity.
          <a href="#b_kina1999" class="ref bibl">Kinney</a> (1999, pp.
          321, 323), commenting on <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>: This passage
            [quoted from pp. 31–2 above] has long been interpreted as a factual account . . . ; but
            there is at least another reading possible: that Confusion was the theme and the whole
            evening performed as planned. He suggests that the play is (p. 323)
            itself a mixture of the pagan and the Christian. And this is true, in turn,
            because it comes out of a profoundly unsettled cultural moment, the time of
          transition between abandoning Catholicism, when the mystery plays continued to be
          performed in the face of official opposition, and embracing a secular worldview, as
          evidenced in the secular drama.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The first suspicious element is the one just alluded to, getting an acting company
          assembled late at night on the spur of the moment. How would the actors have been rounded
          up? They had probably played in the afternoon on the public stage, if not in fact at
          Greenwich, and had played at court the two preceding nights as well; they would be tired
          and dispersed. Supposing they were assembled, could they perform <i>Err.</i> on an unfamiliar stage, by all estimates an odd one (see Staging) erected
          near the middle of Gray’s Inn hall? The difficult scenes to stage, of E. Antipholus locked
          out and the exiting and reentrance of S. Antipholus, S. Dromio, and the Abbess in Act 5,
          would call for some familiarity with that stage. Next, the vocabulary used to account for
          the mishaps—Sorceries and Inchantments . . . Witchcraft . . . Sorcerer or
            Conjuror—closely mirrors that of <i>Err.</i>, as does the
          surprising coincidence of being pinched on both sides with its possible
          glance at Doctor Pinch. If <i>Err.</i> influences <i>Gesta</i>—and no one knows how long after Shrovetide 1595 the latter was
          written—could a single performance have had such an effect on the writer? (Of course, he
          might have seen <i>Err.</i> later, as often as it was played.) Were the
          Gray’s Inn members as humiliated by the disgraceful goings on as they say? Did they cover
          that embarrassment by quickly setting up a court to interrogate the Sorcerer? Had they not
          planned anything for 29 Dec.? Did they really decide after that trial to have a next grand
          night on 3 Jan., when an elaborate masque was presented (see )? Such performances take great planning. Granted that the report
          sounds authentic as it describes the Night of Errors and its immediate consequences, it
          does not square with the extremely elaborate, very expensive planning that the first words
          of <i>Gesta Grayorum</i> (ed. Bland, 1968, pp. 5–6) describe: The great number of gallant Gentlemen that <i>Grays-Inn</i>
            afforded at ordinary Revels, betwixt <i>All-hollontide</i> [1 Nov.] and
              <i>Christmas</i>, exceeding therein the rest of the Houses of Court,
            gave occasion to some Well-willers of our Sports . . . to wish an Head answerable to so
            noble a Body, and a Leader to so gallant a Company: Which Motion was more willingly
            hearkened unto, in regard that such Pass-times had been intermitted by the space of
            three or four Years, by reason of Sickness and Discontinuances.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">[<i>6</i>] After many Consultations had hereupon, by the
            Youths, and others that were most forward herein, at length, about the 12th of <i>December</i> . . . it was determined, that there should be elected a
            Prince of <i>Purpoole</i>, to govern our State for the time; which was
            intended to be for the Credit of <i>Grays Inn</i>, and rather to be
            performed by witty Inventions, than chargeable Expences. But the expenses were
          high, causing a levy on the members (and getting ten pounds from an alumnus, Lord
          Treasurer William Cecil).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">An alternative is to say this was all scripted, including a near riot that did not occur,
          a display of Templarian anger that never happened, and a planned performance of <i>Err.</i> to an audience so suitable for it that many have proposed that
          the play was written for Gray’s Inn (though not necessarily for these revels, which seem
          to have been determined on only some two weeks before it was played). There is some allure
          to the notion that Sh. wrote the play especially for these revels, for then the appearance
          of the Chamberlain’s men is most easily accounted for. <a href="#b_thos1956" class="ref bibl">Thomas</a> (1956, pp. 380–1) makes the
          most closely reasoned case for such an occasional composition (see ), though like others who argue that <i>Err.</i>
          was written for Gray’s, he does not mention the apparently impromptu nature of the events
          recorded in <i>Gesta Grayorum</i>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The contemporary influence of <i>Err.</i> was sufficient to encourage
          the anonymous author of <i>The Birth of Hercules</i>, a version of
          Plautus’s <i>Amphitruo</i>, to include a witty servant named Dromio. The
          date of this manuscript play is uncertain, but on the basis of watermarks cannot be before
          1597 (ed. <a href="#b_theb1911" class="ref bibl">Bond</a>, 1911, p. v). Bond goes on
          to say (pp. x f.), The <i>Birth of Hercules</i> is a pretty close
            adaptation, or even translation, of the <i>Amphitruo</i> . . . increased in bulk nearly one third by the addition of the
            second servant, Dromio [etc.] . . . additions probably suggested by the <i>Comedy of Errors</i>. Dromio is a second servant (with Sosia) of
          Amphitruo, sent by the returning master to tell Alcmena he is coming home, hence
          interrupting Jupiter’s night with her. Dromio has been delayed by a tempest that nearly
          wrecked his ship, another detail possibly suggested by <i>Err.</i></p>

            F1 marked for performance, perhaps by the so-called Nursery company,
          whose function was to train actors, male and female, to take their places in the two
          Restoration companies, the King’s (Killigrew’s) and the Duke’s (Davenant’s). Evans (p. 6)
          allows the possibility that a provincial touring company, drawn from Nursery and King’s
          company players, might have used the prompt copy as late as 1672. Three actors, John Coysh
          (E. Dromio), Thomas Disney (S. Antipholus), and Sarah Cook (Adriana), were associated with
          Killigrew’s company at the time. <i>Err.</i> was assigned to the King’s
          company in 1668–9 when older plays were alloted to the new companies to help fill up their
          repertories (<a href="#b_nica1952" class="ref bibl">Nicoll</a>, <i>History</i>, 1952, 1:354). No performance of
            <i>Err.</i> by that company is recorded, but it appears that the mixed
          company did play it because the parts have been cast in the margins. <a href="#b_thel1960" class="ref bibl">Van Lennep</a> (<i>London

            production in [<i>187</i>] London, but it seems somewhat more likely
            that the cast represents a provincial touring company.
          <a href="#b_burs1966" class="ref bibl">Burner</a> (1966)

          Drury Lane; the version he used, Hull’s very slightly modified, was probably the one
          published in 1808 by Inchbald; she, however, almost certainly had no hand in the text but

          mimicked. The performance was as adapted to dramatic representation, and performed
            at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden; Odell (3:236) thinks this refers to some

            11. . . . The new director, Mr. Clifford Williams, was less capricious [than
            Komisarjevsky], even if some of us were alarmed at first by what seemed to be a stern
            invitation to the dance: a portentous and needless mime. Then cheerfulness broke in: the
            occasion became a blend of Mr. Williams and the livelier <i>commedia dell’ arte</i>, Shakespeare intervening. The night
            depended most surely upon the brothers Antipholus, the mild Ephesian and the fussy
            traveler from Syracuse. [McCowen and Richardson] were plausibly twins. Mr. McCowen
            presented a blandly sententious young man who, on being offered a wife, a house, a gold

            war. Not a man to be toyed with unwisely. Did he not gnaw with my teeth my bones

            nothing particularly sophisticated about this choreography in itself, but for a comedy
            of improbable coincidences it made an irresistible visual assertion that ritual and

            the style of Shakespearean production characteristic of the Peter Hall years at
            Stratford: Kenneth Tynan observed that this style could be recognized by solid
              Brechtian settings that emphasise wood and metal instead of paint and canvas; and by
              cogent, deliberate verse-speaking that discards melodic cadenzas in favour of meaning

          p. 15a): The 1962 production has mellowed with success, and has lost the
            original ingredient of anxiety and inward restlessness. Some of the characters now seem
            aware that there is no problem in this business of mistaken identity, that it is
            moonshine.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          Two new members of the cast, Mr. Donald Sinden as the Duke and Mr. John
            Walsh as the father of the Antipholuses, certainly suggested this. Since theirs is the
            first scene, if we overlook the parade of the whole company followed by the
              ballet of figures from some picture of eighteenth-century Venice, the
            tone set by the Duke and Aegeon is important to the whole. Their scene lacked tension
            and appeared long drawn out. . . . 
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The fun and the reality now derived chiefly from the resemblance between
            the Antipholuses in attitude and temper of mind. Neither knew that he had a double
            possessing the same mixture of deep-seated complacency and superficial excitability, but
            we knew it. Soon the mere entrance of one twin was enough to conjure up the thought of
            the other and in fact absent twin. Mr. Rose by making Dromio of Ephesus the simpler,
            slower witted of the two servants added something new to the setup. Mr. MacGregor has
            developed Dromio of Syracuse into a man for all seasons where farce is
            concerned.

          Both the new Luciana (Miss Janet Suzman) and the new Courtezan (Miss Susan

            valuable weight to the ending. She brought out, as Miss Diana Rigg as Adriana continues
            to do, both the reality of the character and the aspect of farce that it is compelled by
            the situation to present. But on the whole there is too little of the first element in
            this year’s revival.

          Ephesus, as staged by John Napier and Dermot Hayes, is a fun-city bursting
            with novelty shops and tourist traps, swarming with gloved mobsters and amiable
            thigh-flashing tarts, and under the thumb of a hulking ducal dictator . . . who first
            waddles on under a load of military fruit salad to deliver his judgment on Aegeon over

          All this represents no particular time or place, but it is certainly the
            domain of comedy; and comedy of a kind that expands naturally into music. As with the
            RSC’s previous excursions into popular music, Guy Woolfenden’s score knows its place. It
            does not give you much to hum on the way out, but it supplies an admirable springboard
            into dramatic song and dance. The lyrics, mainly built from turning points in the plot,
            have the effect of further translating the story into fairy tale.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The sentence on Aegeon is worked up into a chorus number that turns his
            predicament into a game. Likewise, Antipholus’s proposition to the indignant Luciana (a
            spinsterly bespectacled Francesca Annis) changes into a playful duet.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          By such means the whole show ascends into comic fantasy. Antipholus,
            locked out of his house, conducts an enraged debate over the intercom which he finally
            pulls away from the wall. The culminating hue and cry starts during a western and takes
            place to the sound of gunshot and thundering hooves. Also, there are delicious added
            details such as Richard Griffiths’s officer, a glum stooge dragged around after his
            captive and making a dejected ceremonial appearance in Greek army tutu and long

          We are unlikely ever to see a funnier Adriana than Judi Dench, a

            close casting from Roger Rees (wearing his camera even into the bedroom) and Mike
            Gwilym, a sharp gum-chewing resident who fits precisely the Las Vegas-like setting.
            Michael Williams and Nickolas Grace dispatch two carrot-haired, baggy-jeaned Dromios
            with balletic clowning. And Robin Ellis’s Dr Pinch goes off nicely in a puff of

          the Shakespeare Centre Library at Stratford-upon-Avon. E.g., (p. 15): Adriana
            taking refuge in Campari and soda, and the bespectacled Luciana attractively peering
            around her book at the play’s action, were given a lengthy, amusing duet and dance
            routine concerning A man is master of his liberty.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The setting, presumably a Greek resort town, was uncertain enough to make one reviewer
          (Ned Chaillet, <i>Times</i> [London] 15 Nov., p. 17) call it an
            Italian village square bedecked with trinkets and tourist goods and another,
          reviewing the previous year’s Stratford-upon-Avon production: A contemporary
            Turkish market where garments hang from the balconies, the Porpentine and the
          Tiger are bars, and Aegeon [is] clearly in the rag trade (Roger Warren,

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Nunn’s production seems to have been the first in which Adriana takes S. Antipholus to
          bed, raising pretty serious problems about how he and Luciana are to behave thereafter.
          Reviewers, however, hardly even mention the seduction, and none reports how the aftermath
          was handled. In the 1980 San Diego National Shakespeare Festival production, Adriana
          started out as a dowdy housewife opposite a sexy, knowing Luciana who instructed her how
          to improve her appearance. She did so, and entered Act 5 visibly pregnant, fainting when
          she saw that there were two Antipholuses. See n. <a href="#cn_0607a" class="ref note_cn">607–14</a>.</p>

          The other Karamazovs play the twins . . . and it is difficult to tell one

            Cossacks quick with a retort. Their Dromios (Samuel Ross Williams and Randy Nelson) look
            different but their comedy is equally demented. More than his partners, Mr. Nelson has a

            possible, the company takes its cue for comedy from Shakespeare. A Dromio reference to
            football . . . is followed by a huddle, a game of touch and a cheer for old Notre

          O’Callaghan (Dromios), Zoe Wanamaker (Adriana), Paul Greenwood and Peter McEnery
          (Antipholuses). Adrian Noble directed. Ultz designed the costumes and makeup. All the
          actors had colored faces, usually white, but blue for the Antipholuses. The Dromios were
          in clown suits (baggy pants, oversize shoes, and big noses). The pit band marked every
          pratfall, collision, fart, and kiss with appropriate sounds. Luciana’s blond hair looked
          like an inverted ice cream cone. James Fenton (<i>Sunday Times</i>
          [London], 14 Aug., p. 35) admires Noble’s making the actors speak the verse
            pantomime style, with a blatant emphasis on simple rhythms and rhymes. This is some of
            the best verse-speaking we have had at Stratford in recent years. Anthony
          Masters (<i>Times</i> [London], 10 Aug., p. 11) regrets the unrelieved
          farce: The one element in the play which will never be there is the very real drama
            surrounding Adriana’s marriage with the Ephesian Antipholus, which is cracking up badly
            when his Syracusan twin brother blunders in. Husband’s back from lunch late and
            reluctantly after long business drinks, wife’s sister refusing marriage because she sees
            it in practice: there is plenty here a director could have used.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">199025 Apr. Stratford-upon-Avon, RSC. Desmond Barrit (Antipholuses),
          Graham Turner (Dromios), Estelle Kohler (Adriana), Caroline Loncq (Luciana), David Waller
          (Aegeon), David Killick (Pinch). Stanley Wells (<i>Times Literary
            Supp.</i>, 4–19 May, p. 474): Ian Judge’s production . . . is
            firmly grounded in David Waller’s serious delivery of the grief-stricken Aegeon’s
            opening narration, its comic potential acknowledged only as, warming to his task, he
            obligingly draws a diagram [of the arrangement of the family on the mast] to explain to
            the increasingly sympathetic Duke how he and his family succeeded in surviving
            shipwreck. This is affecting and true, but as soon as it is over we are thrust into a
            world of farcical stereotypes and mechanistic stylization which, accurately though it
            may reflect the dexterity of Shakespeare’s plotting, drains the play’s characters of
            even the limited reality with which Shakespeare has infused them. The Merchant becomes
            two nearly identical, strutting, bowler-hatted business men, one in green, the other in
            purple, carrying briefcases and umbrellas—these figure largely in the production—and
            sharing the character’s lines, sometimes speaking them in unison. Balthasar is a
            conventionally funny huntin’-and-shootin’ old buffer, Luciana a bespectacled frump first
            seen reading a copy of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, in violent contrast to Estelle Kohler’s
            wearisomely outrageous Adriana, prancing around in billowing veils and relentlessly
            burlesquing every line with exaggerated gestures, simpering leers, and camp
            intonation.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          This production style puts a premium upon cleverness. It takes its tone
            from the decision to have each pair of twins played almost throughout by a single actor.
            Their casting is unconventional. Antipholus (Desmond Barrit) is a fat, sleek-haired
            Latin type, actorishly skilful at milking lines for comic effect, more convincing in his
            flirtations with the audience than in his wooing of Luciana. Dromio . . . is usually
            thought of as a robust contrast to his more gentlemanly master, but Graham Turner, a
            natural mime with expressive features, is a slight figure, sweet-natured in his efforts
            to entertain and with a delicate touch of pathos in his put-upon
            resilience. . . . 
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The most original aspect of the production lies in its evocation of the
            Surrealist movement in, for example, the reproduction of Salvador Dalí’s couch modelled
            on Mae West’s lips on which Adriana and Luciana rise from below the stage on their first
            entry, and also in the symbolic devices hanging over the stage in Mark Thompson’s
            attractive, door-lined set. This is acceptable because there is something surrealistic
            in the confusions of this play, especially in its hints at supernatural forces at work
            in Ephesus. Less happy is the director’s use of traditions of popular entertainment.
            There is delicacy in the initial reminiscences of René Clair, Ibert and Chaplin, but
            before long we are in the world of <i>Carry On</i> films and television
            magic shows.

          Two especial traps for self-indulgent directors . . . are the Courtesan
            and Dr Pinch. Mr Judge falls into both. His Courtesan is a leering, hobble-skirted
            madam, drawing easy laughs as, tottering on high heels, she flails around with a
            besequinned handbag; and the Dr Pinch episode is drawn out interminably with Pinch as a
            tasteless caricature of Dali himself in the role of a conjurer (in the standard
            misinterpretation of Shakespeare’s use of the word) who causes Antipholus to disappear
            and Dromio to be sawn in half.
        </p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">
          The production reaches a climax of self-destructive vulgarity with the
            descent of a madonna surrounded by flashing neon lights to indicate the Priory from
            which the Abbess and her attendants emerge in parodic costumes. If at this late stage in
            the proceedings something Shakespearean emerges it is, first, because Cherry Morris as
            the Abbess, triumphing over her ludicrous get-up, gives a sense of emotional reality to
            her reunion with her long-lost husband, and second because, in the play’s delightful
            coda, with two Dromios at last on stage together, Shakespeare’s point that we depend for
            our sense of identity on the reactions of others is realized in the embarrassed joy with
            which Graham Turner’s Dromio finds not only his brother but himself.

            <i>Err.</i> was played infrequently in the 18th and 19th c., but in
          the 20th c. performances increase. Hans Rothe’s version (1921), which strips the play of
          the romance plot, emphasizes Luce and gives her a low-comic cook Emmelina, was popular
          well into the late 20th c.; sometimes the romance plot is restored (Stahl, pp. 620–1; <a href="#b_goob1991" class="ref bibl">Gooch, Thatcher, et al.</a> 1991, e.g., 1:210, #2185, 12 Dec. 1982).</p>

          producer Tetsuo Anzai (p. 491), relied upon the style of the Commedia dell’Arte. We
            built a sham, play-within-a-play stage roofed with a tent upon the real stage of the
            hall; and all the action was done on this counterfeit stage . . . to induce a more
            willing suspension of disbelief by making the audience aware that everything is a play,
            so that we could pursue the intensity of the action to a greater extremity than possible
            otherwise. In Norio Deguchi’s production of 1987 the actors wore masks until the

          Theatre, London (simulcast in the United States); the Trevor Nunn production, 1976,
          discussed above; and the Flying Karamazov Brothers’ 1983 production, filmed at Lincoln
          Center after moving to New York from Chicago.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The most available of the television productions is a BBC version from 1984. Director:
          James Cellan-Jones, Cyril Cusack (Aegeon), Susanne Bertish (Adriana), Roger Daltrey (both
          Dromios), Charles Gray (Solinus), Wendy Hiller (Aemilia), and Joanne Pearce (Luciana).
            <a href="#b_rotk1990" class="ref bibl">Rothwell &amp; Melzer</a> (1990, p. 44): A main feature is the
              doubling of the principal characters, the Antipholuses and the Dromios,
            the latter being portrayed by rock star, Roger Daltrey. . . . The <i>commedia dell arte</i> style allows integration of
            mimes and street-players into the plot and <i>mise en
              scène</i>. Equally attention-getting is the huge map of the eastern
            Mediterranean that makes up the market floor and the marvellous lighting that gives the
            illusion of a sun-drenched Mediterranean seaport town.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Locating the play, with some interest either in showing an Ephesus or, as
          is now more common, in devising a setting far removed from a historical locale, depends on
          the physical resources and aesthetics of the time. <i>Err.</i> requires
          no interior locations; it does require doors to be knocked on and entered and exited from.
          But over time conventional spaces have developed. With the establishment of movable
          scenery following the Restoration, the painted flats and drops follow the same pattern
          until the rise of elaborate fixed sets in the 1870s. Prompt-books and playbooks describe
          the scenery, even stipulating into which grooves the flats were to be placed. The play now
          requires a throne room, a street in the mart, a chamber in E. Antipholus’s house, and the
          exterior of the priory. For Hull’s version, there has to be a garden, and, under the
          influence of Reynolds’s staging, a chamber in the priory for the revised conclusion.
          Costumes apparently made little attempt to give a Near Eastern atmosphere. <a href="#pw_dang1827" class="ref bibl_pw">Daniel</a> (ed. 1827)
          lists what is needed: DUKE.—Rich shape with long flowing arm-hole robe of blue
            velvet, white pantaloons, white shoes, hat and feathers . . . TWO ANTIPHOLISES.—Light
            blue shapes trimmed with yellow buttons, blue stockings, russet boots, cross belts,
            swords, hat and feathers . . . ADRIANA. Rich embroidered satin dress, with flowing
            crimson satin robe, jewels, &amp;c.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">By the end of the 19th c. elaborate scenery becomes popular. Photographs of the Crane and
          Robson production of 1885 noted above show decorative excess. The Duke, in oriental
          finery, sits on a raised throne with a canopy, guarded by soldiers in Roman armor
          (helmets, shields, chain armor). This opening scene features huge Corinthian columns and a
          view of Ephesus through a large bow window. The Abbess wears a Greek Orthodox–style habit.
          The Courtesan (Phryne) is borne in on a sedan chair carried by four bare-chested black
          youths. For Act 5, there are palm trees in the foreground, and Ephesus harbor in the
          background (<i>The Illustrated American</i>, 14 Oct. 1893).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In recent times, beginning with Komisarjevsky’s famous Stratford-upon-Avon production
          (1938), the settings have taken on surprising qualities. <a href="#b_leis1986" class="ref bibl">Leiter</a> (1986, p. 69): Hudd
            [Old Vic, 1957] and Treyz chose the environment of Elizabethan playhouses; Robin
            Phillips (1975) [Stratford, Ont.] found fun in the Canadian West of Conestoga
            wagons . . . ; John Ezell (Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival, 1980) used a classical
            Mediterranean town; Arthur Storch employed seventeenth-century Florence; Gillette A.
            Elvgren, Jr. (Pittsburgh, 1981), evoked Turko-Hollywood-Roman . . . and
            Robert Woodruff [1983] went for a theatrical world suggestive of the circus. Aiming at
            an Ephesus where the strangest things could happen, Nagle Jackson in 1970 [Oregon Sh.
            Festival, Ashland] created a town with a flamboyant assortment of colorful, often
            bizarre, theatrical images. Modern dress also has been tried, as in John Bell’s
            Australian production of 1978, set in the clearly cosmopolitan city of
              Ephesus. . . . Trevor Nunn created a loosely defined modern setting that
            suggested anywhere from Turkey to Las Vegas. The 1920s were the background for Bill
            Cain’s 1980 Boston Shakespeare Company version: strobe lights, barbershop
              quartets, and costumes made of long-johns . . . tickled many funny bones.
            That same year Paul Barry’s New Jersey staging found the Mardi Gras in a 1920s New
            Orleans a congenial setting; a wild assortment of costumes was thus justified. Ben
            Levit’s 1978 Dallas production . . . successfully placed the play in a 1930s Neapolitan
            world. . . . In such modern dress productions the Duke was likely to be a garish
            dictator and the Syracusans foolish tourists.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><i>Err.</i> has invited two staging opportunities that stand out, the
          doubling of one or both sets of twins by a single actor, and the perhaps surprising
          introduction of <i>commedia dell’arte</i> when the
          play makes no clear call for such staging.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The first instance I can find of one actor’s playing both twins comes in 1899, when Ben
          Greet plays the Dromios (see above). In the 1923 production by the Ethiopian Art Theatre
          (also above), the <i>New York Times</i> (20 May 1923) praises Charles
          Olden for doubling the Dromios. Both sets of brothers were doubled in Stratford, Conn.
          (1963); in Stratford, Ont., in 1989, in a double bill with <i>Tit.</i>;
          in the BBC television production (1984) with Michael Kitchen as Antipholus and Roger
          Daltrey as Dromio (<a href="#b_wils1991" class="ref bibl">Willis</a>, 1991, a detailed performance diary); and in the 1990 RSC
          production at Stratford-upon-Avon (above). The doubling requires that some speeches be cut
          or that they be combined. Sometimes a mute twin appears, playing with his back to the
          audience. In the television version, split-scene capabilities let the twins talk to each
          other.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The problems that arise in doubling are addressed by <a href="#b_slar1991" class="ref bibl">Slawson</a> (1991, pp. 67–8):
            While casting one actor as both Dromios or both Antipholuses may solve the
            problem of their appearance, it creates new problems for the director. Chief among these
            is blocking the final scene, in which both sets of twins appear onstage simultaneously.
            The most common solution . . . is to use a mute double for one of the
            twins and to cut or reassign the lines of that twin. However, unless skillfully done,
              [<i>68</i>] cutting parts of the final scene lessens the comic effect
            of the whole production.
          <a href="#b_holp1997" class="ref bibl">Holland</a> (1997, pp.
          58–9) elaborates on the use of a single actor for both twins: Since the idea cannot
            possibly work in the theatre [as it can on television], I shall be wondering what is
            lost in the process. . . . One of the great [<i>59</i>] pleasures for
            the audience watching <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> is that we know the
            answer. We know, because Egeon has told us, that there are two pairs of twins; we know
            why Antipholus of Syracuse is recognized by the citizens of Ephesus and that the reason
            has nothing to do with Ephesus’ reputation for sorcery nor is it a dream. But we also
            find that the overweening confidence with which we begin, knowing the answers, is shaken
            in the course of the play. Every time I watch the play, I end up forgetting which Dromio
            has been sent on which errand by which Antipholus. . . . We are nearly as confused as
            the characters. When both Dromios are played by the same actor the audience’s ability to
            be confused, a confusion that the play wants us to undergo, is simply evaded, evaded
            because the audience comes to follow actor, not role, Graham Turner not
          Dromio.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It has become usual to stage <i>Err.</i> with <i>commedia dell’arte</i> aspects, started on the English stage by
          Komisarjevsky in 1938. The first mention of such staging that I have found occurred at
          Strasbourg in 1935 in a performance by a traveling German company; the Dromios wore
            <i>commedia</i> costumes (<a href="#b_kosa1935" class="ref bibl">Koszul</a>, 1935, p. 184). How much
          earlier that company had adopted the costumes I do not know. The next I have found is
          Douglas Seale’s Birmingham Repertory Theatre production in 1948 (<a href="#b_trej1963" class="ref bibl">Trewin</a>, 1963, p. 146). Clifford
          Williams’s 1962 RSC production featured an unobtrusive harlequinade as audience for
          Egeon’s tale, and thereafter as needed. Coincidentally, the 1963 Stratford, Ont., and
          Stratford, Conn., productions continued the trend.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The Ontario production was directed by Jean Gascon to very bad reviews, not limited to
          the <i>commedia</i> aspects. <a href="#b_edia1963" class="ref bibl">Edinborough</a> (1963, p. 433): He
            chose to ignore the text of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> and make it a
            Punchinello pantomime affair . . . [with] five Punchinellos acting as general
            theatrical factotums around the stage. All the actors save the women wore
            <i>commedia</i> masks.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The Connecticut production was directed by Douglas Seale, who presumably repeated his
          Birmingham production. <a href="#b_ogdd1963" class="ref bibl">Ogden</a> (1963, p. 438) on Seale’s production: Apparently in order
            to alleviate the long opening recital, the director introduced a troupe of <i>commedia dell’arte</i> players. As Aegeon related
            his past history, the half-masked actors filed on, seated themselves facing the audience
            along the front edge of the apron, and occasionally one or the other mimed a bit of what
            was being said stage center. But as the evening progressed one began to wonder just what
            these figures had to do with the play. Upstage center they erected portions of a trestle
            stage, moved from pose to pose, watched the action, and at one point two members of the
            company interrupted the drama with a dance. But never did the troupe become part of the
            performance.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent"><a href="#b_rogg1964" class="ref bibl">Rogoff</a> (1964, p.
          168) wonders why <i>commedia</i> should be used at
          all, referring to the coincidence of the employment of it in the two preceding
          productions, and says: As a directorial exercise, [<i>Err.</i>]
            asks only for a jubilant return to what might be called basic theatre . . . [to]
            primitive mummeries, lampoons, and Dionysiac celebrations. . . . There may be little
            inherently wrong in choosing <i>commedia</i> for
            production background, but it is, at least, less right than the available choice of
            earlier models, the Roman perhaps more than the Greek. . . . Why leave the roots
            behind?</p>

          on, With a view to remedy these defects, the editor, a few years ago, reduced the

        <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="normal">The Text on the Stage</h4>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">I have examined the following prompt-books and printed texts based on performances at
          specific theaters and dates. The prompt-books contain, on interleaved pages or blank
          spaces in the text, descriptions of the scenery, props, costumes, and stage business; I
          have excerpted a few of these to give some flavor of productions. But much of my
          discussion deals with the changes made in Sh.’s language. <a href="#b_halw1979" class="ref bibl">Halstead</a> (1979, vol. 2) collates most
          of the following prompt-books, and several more, but his collations are sometimes
          incorrect or misleading. For the theatrical texts I give the Folger Library identification
          number, <a href="#b_shac1965" class="ref bibl">Shattuck</a>’s
          (1965) identification number, or a library call number.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The treatment of the text, from Smock Alley in the 1670s through most of the 19th c., is
          a history of cutting what is already a very short play. At 1,920 lines it is the shortest
          in the canon (line counts before the standardizing of TLNs use 1,735, 1,787, or some such
          as the number of lines). Songs were added as early as the Nursery arrangement; in the 18th
          c. the play was either the main piece or an after-piece in an evening of two plays, and
          indeed it has been paired with <i>Tit.</i> in the 20th c. The earliest
          cuts often involve ten or more consecutive lines, totaling 400–500 lines per version. All
          these cuts take out pretty much the same material: most of Egeon’s and the Abbess’s roles,
          Adriana and Luciana’s debate on wifely subordination, badinage between master and servant
          involving obscure or indecent puns, speeches expressing Adriana’s jealousy, S.
          Antipholus’s highly decorated wooing of Luciana, indecent or blasphemous material
          involving the Courtesan, and speeches in Act 5 that recapitulate the action.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The data detailed below are drawn from the following versions of the play:</p>

        


        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The Smock Alley reviser, probably Joseph Ashbury, streamlines the text in often admirable
          ways, as for example <a href="#tln_0045" class="ref lb">45b–52</a>, where Egeon muddies the water about why he was away (business trip) from
          his wife for most of her pregnancy (muddies because the lines about his
          agent’s death’s endangering his wealth and the periphrasis about her pregnancy are not
          strictly necessary). At To <i>Epidamium</i>, a hand adds
          something like where some time | wee liv’d, and at <a href="#tln_0053" class="ref lb">53</a> rewrites: There had we [not <i>she</i>] not been long, before the birth of the twins.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Balthazar is deleted from the SD to 3.1, and a single line surviving from his part, <a href="#tln_0640" class="ref lb">640</a>, is spoken instead by Angelo. Even that line
          is cut by Hull. Oddly, Balthazar reappears in Inchbald’s Dramatis Personae (Mr. Atkins),
          presumably because Hull retained (his spelling) You’re sad, Signor
            Balthasar (<a href="#tln_0638" class="ref lb">638</a>); the character is
          silent, and yet the custom of casting him continued, beginning with Cumberland (1827).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">These cuts number about 538 lines and half-lines. They inevitably anticipate most of what
          later producers would cut, chiefly by shortening long speeches, getting rid of the
          unintelligible (either garbled lines or references that no longer made sense), and
          deleting offensive sexual or religious language. It is interesting that, as a reflection
          of changes in taste, Sh.’s images are sometimes apparently thought to be too
          ingenious.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">There is also some minor rewriting, e.g., <a href="#tln_0106" class="ref lb">106</a>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Hull’s 1793 version, adopted by Kemble, influenced performances of <i>Err.</i> until Phelps restored much of the original text and cut Hull’s additions,
          though many of Hull’s cuts were retained. <a href="#b_chih1935" class="ref bibl">Child</a> (1935, p. 8) summarizes the nature of Hull’s changes
          when he writes about Kemble’s theatrical practices: His <i>Comedy of
              Errors</i> at Covent Garden in 1808 was nothing but the version made for that
            theatre nearly thirty years before [i.e., Hull’s] . . . —a version which takes infinite
            pains to remove every trace of rhyme; turns the chain into a bracelet; mixes up
            Balthazar and Aegeon [sic for Angelo]; squeezes pathos or sentiment into
            the Antipholis (<i>sic</i>)-Adriana-Luciana plot, writes up Dromio of
            Syracuse into a fat part (Gentleman Lewis had been great in it, and Munden followed
            him), and gives to Antipholis of Syracuse one immortal line of blank verse: In
              spite of my assertion to the contrary—where Shakespeare had written:
              For urging it the second time to me.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Hull rewrites the rhymed speeches into blank verse at <a href="#tln_0286" class="ref lb">286–317</a>, <a href="#tln_0577" class="ref lb">577–81</a>, <a href="#tln_0787" class="ref lb">787–860</a>, and <a href="#tln_1104" class="ref lb">1104–34</a>; the rewriting involves cuts as
          well. The quality of Hull’s rewriting may be seen in Luciana’s speech on female
          subordination (<a href="#tln_0289" class="ref lb">289–99</a>):
            Why, headstrong liberty belongs to a man, <br/>And ill befits a
            woman’s gentle mind. <br/>There’s nothing situate under Heaven’s eye, <br/>But hath it’s
            [sic] bound on earth, in sea, and air; <br/>The beasts, the fishes, and the winged
            tribes, <br/>Are their males subjects, and at their controul. <br/>Man, more divine, the
            master of them all <br/>Indued with intellectual sense and soul, <br/>Is master to his
            female—nay her lord! <br/>Let then your will attend on his commands.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Hull retains some of the Smock Alley cuts—how could he not?—but he also initiates many
          other changes. In 1.1, he avoids the problem of how the boys came to have the same name
            (And, which was strange, the one so like the other, | As could not be
            distinguish’d but by names,
          <a href="#tln_0055" class="ref lb">55–6</a>) this way: our wealth increas’d <br/>By prosp’rous traffic—’till
            my factor’s death, <br/>Drew us unwillingly to Epidamnum. <br/>There had we not been
            long, but she became <br/>A joyful mother of two goodly sons, <br/>And, strange to hear,
            the one so like the other, <br/>They hardly by ourselves could be distinguished.
          He rewrites the opening speech, adding after TLN <a href="#tln_0005" class="ref lb">5</a>
          And terminate, by this, thy rig’rous doom, | Ægeon’s life and miseries
            together. After <a href="#tln_0064" class="ref lb">64</a>, the Duke
          interrupts Ægeon’s account with Stop thy tears—| I long, yet almost dread to hear
            the rest, to break up the long speech, which he, like most producers, cuts by
          close to half. At the end of the scene, Ægeon’s exit speech becomes What friends can misery expect? <br/>This pity but prolongs the date of pain: <br/>And
            to a sure, though short protracted end, <br/>Helpless and hopeless doth Ægeon
            wend, which shows that Hull will write rhymes, though why he reverses Sh.’s
            Hopelesse and helpelesse is a mystery.</p>

          meane, Dromio wonders why Antipholis trusts him with so much money, and
          Antipholis replies that he believes that Dromio loves him too much to rob him; the
          dialogue amounts to 16 lines, serving to cement the loyalty of master and servant. The
          rest of the scene goes by largely unscathed until S. Antipholis’s final speech, which is
          replaced after <a href="#tln_0262" class="ref lb">262</a> by lines beginning
            Misguided by my hopes, in doubt I stray, | To seek what I perchance, may never
            find; the note of a frightening Ephesus is replaced by sentimentality.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Except for rewriting the rhymed dialogue on marital obedience and cutting <a href="#tln_0354" class="ref lb">354–7</a>, perhaps to get rid
          of the puns in 2.1, Hull allows the scene to stand, though he rewrites the garbled passage
            <a href="#tln_0382" class="ref lb">382–9</a>: Sister, you know he promis’d me a bracelet— <br/>Some stranger fair hath
            caught his truant eye, <br/>And triumphs in the gifts design’d for me. <br/>Such trifles
            yet with ease I could forego, <br/>So I were sure he left his heart at home! <br/>I see
            the jewel best enameled <br/>Will lose its lustre—so doth Adriana— <br/>Whom once,
            unwearied with continual gazing, <br/>He fondly call’d the treasure of his
          life!</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In 2.2 much of the punning between servant and master on sconces and Time (<a href="#tln_0429" class="ref lb">429–502</a>) is cut by Hull
          (and by most others, beginning with Smock Alley); the scene resumes at Adriana and
          Luciana’s entrance (<a href="#tln_0504" class="ref lb">504</a>). For the rhymed
          couplets of <a href="#tln_0577" class="ref lb">577–81</a>, he
          substitutes What, was I married to her in my sleep; | Or sleep I now, and dream I
            hear all this? | What error thus deceives our eyes and ears? | Yet, that the mystery I
            may explore, | I’ll seem to entertain the fallacy. He then cuts S. Dromio’s <a href="#tln_0583" class="ref lb">583–7</a>, on being caught in
          fairy land; rearranges some lines; cuts <a href="#tln_0607" class="ref lb">607–15</a>; and substitutes 16 lines, beginning Spread for dinner. I am afraid I shall <br/>Be somewhat awkward, as I am
            not <br/>Acquainted with the ways of the house, <br/>Tho’ I suppose they’ll be so
            courteous <br/>As to instruct a new-comer.—Ay, there they go— <br/>The house with the
            green doors, which answers a question—whoever asked it?—about how the stranger
          managed to guard the door so well; it also tells us a bit about the scenery. The
          prompt-books specify a practical, i.e., workable, lockable door outfitted
          with a bell; this was built into the flat usually called the Street house,
          located in the second groove.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He makes several changes in 3.1. He cuts <a href="#tln_0630" class="ref lb">630–7</a>, adding Silence, thou sot, or I shall sober
            thee! before <a href="#tln_0638" class="ref lb">638</a>, and then cuts <a href="#tln_0641" class="ref lb">641–50</a>, as does Smock
          Alley. At <a href="#tln_0651" class="ref lb">651</a>, But soft, my doore is
            lockt, he adds, Sirrah, ring the bell, allowing E. Dromio to say
            Oh, he’s a little soberer, and he does know his own house now, before an
          accompanying <i>Rings</i>. He then inserts before <a href="#tln_0652" class="ref lb">652</a>: <b>An. of
                Eph.</b><p class="noindent">Will they not hear?</p><br/>
            <br/><b>Dr. of Eph.</b><p class="noindent">In good truth, I think they will not.—My
                mistress, sure, means to be quits with you, master—you denied her a while ago, and
                now she’s determined to deny you.</p><br/>
            <br/><b>An. of Eph.</b><p class="noindent">Have done, thou varlet. Call to them, bid them
                let us in.</p><br/> He cuts Either get thee from the dore, or sit
            downe at the hatch (<a href="#tln_0655" class="ref lb">655</a>), presumably
          because his stage door was solid. Following <a href="#tln_0712" class="ref lb">712</a>, he cuts <a href="#tln_0713" class="ref lb">713–44</a>, as does Smock Alley in large part, and substitutes: <b>An. of Eph.</b><p class="noindent">Get from the gate?—What means this saucy
                language? <br/>There’s something more in this!—Why, Adriana!</p><br/>
            <br/><b>Ad.</b><p class="noindent">[Within.] Hence, you
                familiar coxcomb! Cease your noise, <br/>Or you shall surely pay for all this
                outrage.— <br/>Dromio, make sure you keep fast the doors against ’em.</p><br/>
            <br/><b>An. of Eph.</b><p class="noindent">Why, wife, I say.—</p><br/>
            <br/><b>Dr. of Syr.</b><p class="noindent">[Within.]
                She’s gone back to dinner, sir, to take a refreshing cup, and has no time to answer
                idle questions now.</p><br/>
            <br/><b>An. of Eph.</b><p class="noindent">Now, on my soul, some strange mysterious
                guile, <br/>Lurks underneath this unaccustom’d usage. <br/>Some shameful minion is
                here entertain’d— <br/>Shall I be thus shut forth from my own house, <br/>While they
                are revelling to my dishonour? <br/>Go, fetch an instrument—I’ll break the door,
                <br/>Shatter it to pieces, but I’ll enter.</p><br/> At the end of the scene,
          he cuts <a href="#tln_0781" class="ref lb">781–2</a> and adds
          after <a href="#tln_0783" class="ref lb">783</a> for E. Antipholis: I thank you, sir.—And now, my dainty wife, <br/>Checking my rage, I’ll
            leave you to your follies <br/>Some few short hours; enjoy them while you may,
            <br/>Perchance to-morrow you may rue your jest.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">His largest addition comes at the beginning of 3.2, where he brings onstage in a
              <i>A Garden</i> S. Antipholis, Adriana, Luciana, and
            Hermia, whose sole function is to sing Michael Arne’s setting of Hull’s
            Stray not to those distant plains, a pastoral wish that the beloved
            tarry here with me and love. This addition with its song presumably goes
          back to the 1762 <i>Twins</i> (above), since Arne died in 1784; for the
          1779 revival, Charles Dibdin’s setting was used (<a href="#b_goob1991" class="ref bibl">Gooch, Thatcher, et al.</a>, 1991,
          1:197). The song is preceded by Adriana’s asking S. Antipholis why he is so distant, and
          he replies I would some friendly light | Might chase away the mist that clouds our
            fancies, | And give this dream a meaning! He goes on to describe the garden,
            These beauteous bowers, in nature’s fragrance rich, the whole addition
          apparently concocted to employ pastoral scenery and the song. Sometimes the addition was
          cut. Fawcett, in the J. S. Clarke prompt-book: When wanting to play the piece
            quickly this scene is cut to the entrance of Ant of S . . . beginning with Why
              how now Dromio [<a href="#tln_0862" class="ref lb">862</a>], a
          drastic cut that deletes the wooing of Luciana.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">After the song, Adriana continues, using lines adapted and repeated from <a href="#tln_0505" class="ref lb">505–41</a> in 2.2 until she and
          Hermia exit and 3.2 begins as in Sh. Hull’s repetition of <a href="#tln_0525" class="ref lb">525–41</a> in 2.2 and 3.2 is puzzling; the
          lines disappear from 2.2 as early as Inchbald (1808); the lines had been cut by Smock
          Alley.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Hull now adds 3.3, the meeting between S. Antipholis and Angelo (<a href="#tln_0956" class="ref lb">956–72</a>), which cannot take place in the
          garden but rather requires a change of scenery. At the end of his 3.2 Hull, having cut
          Dromio’s geography of Nell (<a href="#tln_0889" class="ref lb">889–927</a>), has Antipholis exit and lets Dromio conclude the scene with <a href="#tln_0944" class="ref lb">944–5</a>, As from a
            bear a man would run for life, | So I from her that swears she is my wife, and
          exit. His new scene begins with the entrance of Angelo greeting S. Antipholis (<a href="#tln_0956" class="ref lb">956</a>). The scene is required because the garden
          scenery (located in the sixth or last groove, noted in the prompt-books) has to be
          replaced by The Street scenery (located in the first or second grooves) so
          that the two can speak. This new scene requires that Antipholis exit and return
          immediately after Dromio’s lines, unless Hull’s Act 1 ends at Dromio’s exit. This latter
          appears to be what happens. Kemble (1811) adds in his hand to the new entrance of Angelo
          and Antipholis and Dromio of Syracuse, plus the line <i>Ant. of Syr.</i> Haste to the port, and find me out some ship,
          before Angelo’s greeting (<a href="#tln_0956" class="ref lb">956</a>). Kemble is
          elaborating the beginning of Sh.’s Act 2. The scene ends with Antipholis’s rewritten
          soliloquy praising Luciana, which concludes with Unwillingly I go—my wounded soul,
            | (Howe’er from Ephesus my body part) | Lingers behind in Luciana’s heart.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Despite the preservation of F’s five-act division in print, Hull’s 1793 version perhaps,
          and later performances certainly, were presented in three acts. The Folger Library has a
          playbill for the 31 May 1791 performance, a benefit for Hull: After which [i.e.
              <i>The Midnight Lover</i>] will be performed (in Three Acts) The
            COMEDY of ERRORS.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The 19th-c. prompt-books make it clear that the curtain drops at Dromio’s exit at 3.2
          (the bear line), and again at the end of 4.4. As we will see, Reynolds’s
          prompt-book describes a pantomime between S. Dromio and Luce that marks the end of his Act
          1. Act 2 (in a three-act version) begins with Dromio entering, repeating those two lines
          about running from a bear, and being sent off to the port. Act 2 ends at <a href="#tln_1461" class="ref lb">1461</a>, with a good deal of horseplay, recorded in
          the prompt-books, involving struggles between Pinch and the Syracusans, who enter at <a href="#tln_1440" class="ref lb">1440</a>. In fact, Cumberland’s SD is <i>Dr. Pinch runs across from</i> R. <i>to</i> L. <i>after them</i>. This business continues well after Phelps had
          returned to the authentic play, as prompt-books 12, 13, and 14 testify.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Hull’s Act 2 follows Sh.’s Act 4 closely. At the end of Sh’s 4.1 he expands Dromio’s
          speech about returning to Adriana’s to get the purse of ducats; Dromio worries that
            Blowzabell, the renamed Dowsabell, may appear and fright me from
            my purpose. In Sh.’s 4.2, after <a href="#tln_1128" class="ref lb">1128</a>
          Hull gives Luciana an expanded speech urging Adriana’s patience while expressing
          admiration for S. Antipholis’s person as a prelude to her accepting him at
          the end of the play. In 4.3, the meeting of the Courtesan/Lesbia with the Syracusan twins
          is greatly rewritten. Lines <a href="#tln_1231" class="ref lb">1231–63</a> are replaced with S. Antipholis’s scolding her for her looseness: What more temptations? <br/>Mistress, you do impeach your modesty,
            <br/>Here in the street to commit yourself <br/>Into the hands of one who knows you
            not. The Placides give us stage business to accompany her entrance:
            Fondling around his neck. As the Syracusans move to leave her, she
          follows, and Dromio turns on her: No, you don’t. [<i>Draws.</i>]
            Here’s my charm against witches, followed by <a href="#tln_1237" class="ref lb">1237–40</a>. The Placides, Clarke, and Crane
          &amp; Robson record a variant piece of business involving a horseshoe, the charm against
          witches and evil in general: Lesbia turns to Dromio. he faces her, pulls out a
            Horseshoe, and Xes in front to R. H. Hull follows Sh.’s 4.4 almost exactly, but
          he changes Adriana’s Oh binde him, binde him (<a href="#tln_1396" class="ref lb">1396</a>) to O! hold him, hold him, which signals a
          change in business. Reynolds’s prompt-book below shows how the scene was played.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Hull says in his preface that he provides a more satisfactory
            catastrophe than Sh.’s. Following <a href="#tln_1831" class="ref lb">1831</a> Ægeon, Æmilia, and S. Antipholis supply the feeling that Hull finds missing,
          beginning <i>Ægeon</i>. Æmilia! O! support thyself, my soul! | Till
            I, once more, have caught thee within my arms, | Their long, lost happiness!
          Antipholis’s speech includes O raise my father, raise your reverend hands | And
            bless your truant son! Ægeon asks where his lost son is, Æmilia speaks <a href="#tln_1841" class="ref lb">1841–7</a>, then E. Antipholis
          comes forward with an affecting greeting of his parents, and the brothers embrace.
          Following <a href="#tln_1863" class="ref lb">1863</a>, Hull amplifies the future of
          Luciana, as S. Antipholis continues: <p class="noindent">And that the heart which
                beats alone for you, <br/>May, now the mist of error is dispers’d, <br/>Which made
                thee fearful for thy virgin fame, <br/>Obtain a gentle hearing.</p><br/>
            <br/><b>Luc.</b><p class="noindent">Should I find thee <br/>Worthy, and constant, as my
                mind suggests, <br/>The general joy, that smiles around, shall not <br/>Be damp’d by
                any vain reserve of mine.</p><br/> Following <a href="#tln_1897" class="ref lb">1897</a>, the Duke continues: <p class="noindent">And be a
                cheerful witness of the blessings, <br/>Your pious faith, and virtuous resignation,
                <br/>Have drawn upon you from relenting Heaven!</p><br/>
            <br/><b>Ægeon.</b><p class="noindent">Come, and partake <br/>The joys, that gild the
                evening of our days.</p><br/>
            <br/><b>Æmilia.</b><p class="noindent">Joys past the reach of hope!—our lesson this,
                <br/>That misery past endears our present bliss; <br/>Wherein we read with wonder
                and delight, <br/>This sacred truth, Whatever is, is
            right.</p><br/></p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">So ends the play. Strikingly, Hull omits the happy recognition of the Dromios that ends
          the play proper.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">His 1793 text is 1,544 lines long.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Inchbald’s 1808 version copies Hull; the differences may be no more than mistakes. For
          example, thy natiue home (<a href="#tln_0033" class="ref lb">33</a>)
          becomes my native home, and is immediately corrected in 1811. The First and
          Second Merchants have not yet been given names.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Kemble’s 1811 prompt-book has a few handwritten directions for cuts and wording, as well
          as directions for actors’ movements. As we have seen, Kemble adjusts Hull’s 3.3, the
          meeting of S. Antipholis and Angelo, to bring on S. Dromio. He cuts <a href="#tln_1540" class="ref lb">1540–5</a>, <a href="#tln_1614" class="ref lb">1614–16</a>, and <a href="#tln_1618" class="ref lb">1618–19</a> (as do most playbooks after 1811,
          which are willing to shorten the Abbess’s role even more; Smock Alley anticipates many of
          these cuts). The first Merchant is now Cleon, the second is Chares, as they will continue
          to be named.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Reynolds’s 1819 musical version involves some rewriting that describes stage business
          that comes to be recorded in the 19th-c. prompt-books.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">At the end of Sh’s 2.2, Reynolds modifies Hull’s lines (gone is the reference to the
          green door). Dromio is haled from within Dromio, Dromio, and he responds,
            Oh! a lady in waiting—Dear sweet unknown! thy doating Dromio comes. The
          Placides milk this business a bit: after lady in waiting, they add,
            Oh, Oh! its my turn now, and if love making be the only mischief going forward,
            the servant may take place of the master, concluding as Hull does. This business
          prepares for the pantomime at the end of Sh.’s 3.2 (Reynolds’s Act 1).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In 3.1, when E. Antipholis has decided to break down his door, he says to Dromio
            Go. (To Dromio, stamping and menacing). <i>Dromio</i>.
            Gone! This addition becomes common.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Reynolds replaces Hull’s 3.3 with S. Antipholis entering alone to
          praise Luciana, followed by S. Dromio’s lines from Sh.’s 3.2 saying that he is afraid the
          kitchen wench will turn him into a curtal dog made to turn i’ the wheel
            (<a href="#tln_0935" class="ref lb">935–6</a>); Reynolds adds
            I fly with joy, for now I shall be blown safe, | From this same scullion—this
            mountain of mad flesh (moved from <a href="#tln_1457" class="ref lb">1457</a>), then As he is going off, the fat Kitchen Wench suddenly throws up
            the window in Antipholis’s house, and shakes her fist at him. <i>Kitchen
              W.</i> Come back, or I’ll so baste thee Dromio. <i>Dr. of Syr.</i>
            ’Tis she. Notice that the flat containing the workable door now requires a
          workable window. The Placides add more to the pantomime: the Cook (their Kitchen Wench)
          leans out of the window to shake a ladle (a prop suggested by the basting
          language in <i>Err.</i>) at him, leaves the window, enters to Dromio,
          and She catches Dromio. He throws her down—and runs off. L[eft]. She pursues him,
            through 1st &amp; 2 entrances. Dromio hides behind 1. E[ntrance]. R[ight]. H[and].—Cook
            falls over his foot—Dromio hastily pulls her dress over her feet and runs off. Cook
            rises limping. Ring quick, ending their Act 1. This business appears
          irresistible to the actors. J. S. Clarke adds Music. Enter the cook, made up very
            large, but neat—sees Drom. of S. she chases him round as she x’s he trips her up up
            [sic] &amp; while down he exits L. 1. E she being large takes time to rise &amp; as she

            in Cooks embrace: Ring! These calls for a quick curtain complete the evolution
          of a 3-act structure going back to Hull.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Reynolds provides more business for S. Dromio in 4.2, after he bursts in to get the purse
          E. Antipholis needs to pay Angelo. At <a href="#tln_1158" class="ref lb">1158</a>,
            this I wonder at, Adriana (turning to Dromio, who is fanning
            himself) Why how now? Thou art faint! <i>Dr.</i> To be sure I am. <i>Adr.</i> Go—refresh thyself—(Dromio smiles and bows.) Haste—repair thee
            to the kitchen. <i>Dro.</i> The kitchen! O Lord!—don’t mention it—I’m
            quite well, ma’am—quite! The 19th-c. prompt-books examined below write this
          material in.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">In 4.4, Reynolds follows Sh.-Hull to <a href="#tln_1405" class="ref lb">1405</a>,
          Pinch’s cry to Go bind this man, for he is frantic too, meaning E. Dromio.
          But Reynolds elaborates the action. <i>Dr. of Eph.</i> (Rubbing his
            hands with joy.) Good seize the gaoler! the shoulder slapper. <i>Pinch</i>. And him! (Pointing to Dromio.) Seize on that varlet—they are all
            possess’d, | And must be bound and laid in some dark room. <i>Dro. of
              Eph.</i> I! I bound in a dark room. <i>Off.</i> (To Doctor’s
            servants.) Stand off—. Only the Placides retain the business.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Reynolds restores some of the Dromios’ reunion at the end of the play. They are allowed
          to say I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth. . . . And now let’s go hand in hand,
            not one before the other (<a href="#tln_1910" class="ref lb">1910–18</a>), followed by their exit into the Abbey, for which
          Reynolds writes a final scene that preserves most of Hull’s sentimental conclusion. This
          restoration leads to greatly enhanced business for the Dromios. The most elaborate
          prompt-book description is the Placides’. The two Dromios at extreme corners Look
            at each other and turn away laughing—Approach each other C. and stepping in the same
            manner. When near each other, both burst out laughing and run back to proceniums [i.e.,
            the proscenium doors]. Both advance again to centre. They put up L. foot and laugh—they
            put up R. foot in same manner. Dromio of E. looks at himself from head to foot, Turns
            his brother round to look at him, and then giggles to himself—same business with Dromio
            of S. The dialogue ensues, then They place hands on each other’s
            shoulders, and go up as the others advance. The two Dromios change smiles at back, and
            come down extreme corners. Even this business evolves; J. S. Clarke gives part
          of it: at <a href="#tln_1909" class="ref lb">1909</a>
          [Dromios] who have been asleep R &amp; L Now gradually awake—yawn—both X to C &amp;
            up not seeing each other &amp; at the [proscenium] door as they are about to enter, see
            each other—start—, come down C—look at each other—the[y] embrace &amp; look
            together. Finally, the whole business becomes clear in the Crane &amp; Robson
          prompt-book, 1878: at <a href="#tln_1775" class="ref lb">1775–6</a>
          during this Dromio of Ephesus has gone to sleep L[eft]. H[and proscenium
            door], so <a href="#tln_1783" class="ref lb">1783–7</a> is cut. At <a href="#tln_1832" class="ref lb">1832</a>
          During this Dromio of Syracuse enters quickly and unperceived and goes to sleep
            opposite the Dromio of E. R. H.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Henry and Thomas Placide adopt many of the standard cuts noticed already; the following
          are either unique to the Placides or are the first. The most startling cut, considering
          that the passage has drawn the most academic comment, is that of S. Antipholis’s
          water-drop speech (<a href="#tln_0199" class="ref lb">199–204</a>). Since the Placides played the Dromios, they may have thought that there
          was no need to make Antipholis needlessly interesting; they also take away his <a href="#tln_1187" class="ref lb">1187–94</a>. They cut the
          redundancy of <a href="#tln_0255" class="ref lb">255</a>, which repeats <a href="#tln_0254" class="ref lb">254</a>. Nearly like Smock Alley, they cut E.
          Antipholis’s plan to dine with the Courtesan (<a href="#tln_0768" class="ref lb">768b</a>–<a href="#tln_0075" class="ref lb">75a</a>), a cut followed by almost
          no one else. Cutting Pinch’s diagnosis of E. Antipholis as being possessed and needing to
          be tied up in a dark room (<a href="#tln_1380" class="ref lb">1380–2</a>) may reflect current medical practice. They are the only ones to cut all
          of <a href="#tln_1406" class="ref lb">1406–39</a>—others cut
          bits and pieces—a passage that requires a lot of the cast to be onstage in very busy
          action at the end of Act 4. The Abbess’s refusal to turn E. Antipholis over
          to Adriana until she has cured him (<a href="#tln_1572" class="ref lb">1572–6</a>; Smock Alley cuts <a href="#tln_1575" class="ref lb">1575–81</a>) may have seemed too detailed,
          though it is part of the other cuts having to do with illness, or perhaps it is just in
          the tradition of reducing the Abbess’s importance. The Placides are alone in cutting
          Ægeon’s misery at not being recognized by the Ephesian twins (<a href="#tln_1774" class="ref lb">1774–88a</a>). One wonders whether the lines
          are expendably long, susceptible of misplaced laughter rather than pity, or what. Cyril
          Cusack, in the 1984 BBC TV production, wore no beard, so <a href="#tln_1792" class="ref lb">1792–3</a> was cut.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Samuel Phelps’s restoration (1855) has already been mentioned. He cuts only about 234
          lines, considerably fewer than anyone before him. Many are the usual cuts,
          bowdlerizations, removal of unintelligible puns, and the like. For example he cuts, from
          Egeon’s opening speech, <a href="#tln_0037" class="ref lb">37–9</a>, <a href="#tln_0046" class="ref lb">46–52</a>,
            <a href="#tln_0072" class="ref lb">72–8</a>, <a href="#tln_0087" class="ref lb">87</a>, <a href="#tln_0091" class="ref lb">91–3</a>, <a href="#tln_0096" class="ref lb">96</a>, <a href="#tln_0103" class="ref lb">103–5</a>, <a href="#tln_0107" class="ref lb">107–9</a>, <a href="#tln_0116" class="ref lb">116–17</a>, <a href="#tln_0120" class="ref lb">120–3</a>, <a href="#tln_0139" class="ref lb">139</a>, <a href="#tln_0149" class="ref lb">149–52</a>, and <a href="#tln_0158" class="ref lb">158–9</a>, many anticipated by Smock Alley or Hull and followed
          by most others. He restores the garbled <a href="#tln_0385" class="ref lb">385–9</a>. Surprisingly, some of Hull’s additions remain: the
          Duke’s interruption after <a href="#tln_0064" class="ref lb">64</a>, Stop thy
            tears—| I long, yet almost dread, to hear the rest, seems irresistible; Dromio’s
          lines added by Hull at the end of 2.2 (following <a href="#tln_0607" class="ref lb">607</a>) are penciled in following <a href="#tln_0615" class="ref lb">615</a>—these are the important additions. His cuts include the punning on Time (<a href="#tln_0458" class="ref lb">458–502</a>); E. Antipholis’s
          recapitulation (<a href="#tln_1698" class="ref lb">1698–1730</a>); and <a href="#tln_1910" class="ref lb">1910–15</a>, reducing the Dromios’ reunion by half. The Merchants are Kemble’s Cleon
          and Chares, but Lesbia gives way to Courtezan. Phelps also adopts the act and scene
          divisions of F. Hence, the familiar statement that the Phelps production restored Sh.’s
          original text is only partly accurate.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The Clarke prompt-book (3 Oct. 1864) is valuable in describing the
          marketplace setting of 4.3, as S. Antipholis remarks on how he has been familiarly
          approached. The prompt-book begins: Music. Scene 3. The Mart. A lively scene.
            Stalls R. &amp; L. on the extreme L. C. a tailors stall, with goods—and a large basket
            with cover to shut; goods hung over. As scene opens—Citizen Xx recross—stop at
            stalls—during which Enter Ant of Syracuse, some recognize him,—1 A woman meets him &amp;
            bows—2 A man gives him a scroll—3 a page gives him a letter—after this bus the music
            ceases and Ant of S speaks. The basket comes into play at the end of Act 2
            (<i>Err.</i> 4.4, TLN <a href="#tln_1460" class="ref lb">1460</a>) with business of a scuffle involving Pinch and both sets of twins, first the
          Syracusans who escape, then the Ephesians. E. Dromio breaks free and sees large
            basket L. H. jumps in &amp; shuts lid. Pinch sees him &amp; he &amp; 4 officers empty E
            Dro into the water &amp; seem done with Dro. Enter Dromio of Syracuse L. 1. E Comic
            horror of Dr Pinch—&amp; officers as they see Dromio who is C—with his back to the
            audience—&amp; Curtain. Music all through bus very ff.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">George Ellis’s prompt-book (for the 27 Feb. 1864 performance) markings are somewhat
          unlike the preceding ones because of his frequent canceling or replacing of just a word or
          two in a line, as well as adding more frequent notes on how to emphasize readings, e.g.,
            Gaze where you <i>should</i>, and that will <i>clear</i> your sight (<a href="#tln_0844" class="ref lb">844–5</a>). Examples of his minor changes are
            troubles for <i>travels</i> (<a href="#tln_0142" class="ref lb">142</a>), failing for <i>falling</i>
            (<a href="#tln_0201" class="ref lb">201</a> in the water-drop speech), males
            subject for <i>males subjects</i> (<a href="#tln_0293" class="ref lb">293</a>), woman for <i>strumpet</i>
            (<a href="#tln_1416" class="ref lb">1416</a>), and strangers for <i>harlots</i> (<a href="#tln_1682" class="ref lb">1682</a>). He
          follows several bowdlerizations of his predecessors: and she
            would . . . Sir-reverence (<a href="#tln_0876" class="ref lb">876–82</a>), diviner (<a href="#tln_0929" class="ref lb">929</a>), privy (<a href="#tln_0930" class="ref lb">930</a>), as well as the expected replacements for
            God.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">He has fuller notes of business than his predecessors as well, especially when others
          than the Dromios are concerned. In 2.2, when Adriana and Luciana approach the Syracusans,
          Adriana takes his hand (<a href="#tln_0505" class="ref lb">505</a>),
            embraces him (<a href="#tln_0507" class="ref lb">507</a>), and at
            <a href="#tln_0515" class="ref lb">515</a>, Antipholus is bewilder’d during
            this,—suddenly withdraws from Adr,—Dromio greatly excited, also. At <a href="#tln_0560" class="ref lb">560–1</a>, How can she
            thus then call us by our names | Unless it be by inspiration,
          Dro goes up L—in bewilderment,—looks about, at every thing &amp; every body &amp;
            goes over to R,—stands gaping with wonder—his back to the audience.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">It is interesting that in the same year (1864) that Clarke’s American prompt-book records
          the marketplace setting at the beginning of 4.3, Ellis has a new scene, his scene 7, that
          begins at Angelo’s entrance in 3.2 (<a href="#tln_0955" class="ref lb">955</a>); this
          new scene is the one examined as Hull’s 3.3 above. Ellis’s setting is Exterior of
            the House of Antipholus of Ephesus | 2 Gro[ove]; the scene opens with Dromio’s
            As from a bear a man would run for life, | So fly I from her that would be my
            wife (<a href="#tln_0944" class="ref lb">944–5</a>),
          then Enter Antipholus of Syracuse from the House. X’s stage—is going off R-1C—as
              Merch<sup>t</sup> &amp; friend enter L-1C—friend X’es &amp; Exit
            R-2C—as Merch<sup>t</sup> calls Ant—. His next scene, Sh.’s
          4.1., is the Mart, with a sketch showing two bales; directions call for two merchants and
          two porters, Merch<sup>t</sup> seated on a bale, writing mems
            &amp; notes—which he gives to both porters, and sends them off R &amp; L. These
          extras have additional business as far as <a href="#tln_1040" class="ref lb">1040</a>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Ellis’s production was in Feb. 1864, Clarke’s in Oct., but Ellis’s prompt-book was not
          prepared until 1882. Just when the staging of the busy marketplace began I cannot say.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Komisarjevsky’s 1938 prompt-book gives a fascinating description of that landmark
          production, famous for its set with a manic clock that chimes hours unconnected with the
          chronology of the play. In the center of the stage is the abbey, with the clock, flanked
          on stage left by the Phoenix, Pinch’s house, the Tiger Inn, a pawn shop (the
            usurer’s, designated the 4th Merchant in SPs), Balthazar’s
          house, and the Porcupine, and on the right by the Centaur, a tailor’s house, an unmarked
          door, a fish stall (5th Merchant), and Angelo’s house. The Phoenix and the
          Porcupine have windows, used prominently. Ranged before the houses are three squat blocks
          used as seats. Sh.’s cast has been fleshed out with a tailor, innkeeper, three policemen,
          two sailors, two ladies, and the extra merchants. Luce is always called Nell. These extras
          groan, sigh, and murmur during the long speeches in the first and final acts. They are
          also given portions of the long speeches (e.g., <a href="#tln_1588" class="ref lb">1588–97</a> are divided among the fourth Merchant, Balthazar,
          Angelo, Courtesan, the fifth Merchant, the tailor, and the first Merchant). Another
          feature of this production is the silent presence of Pinch and the Courtesan throughout
          the play; Nell appears at the Phoenix’s window or at the door, once amorously embracing E.
          Dromio.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Komisarjevsky rearranges one section of the play to conclude his first act: after S.
          Antipholus’s wooing of Luciana and her exit to get Adriana’s goodwill (<a href="#tln_0860" class="ref lb">860</a>), Angelo enters with the chain, offering it
          to the wrong brother (<a href="#tln_0955" class="ref lb">955–79</a>). After the exit, Komisarjevsky inserts <a href="#tln_1103" class="ref lb">1103–34</a> from 4.2, Adriana’s mortified
          response to Luciana’s report, played from the window of her house, followed by Dromio’s
          description of Nell, which brings down the curtain.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The clock strikes seven times in the play, ringing 12 o’clock at the end of 1.1; 1
          o’clock and 2 o’clock at the end of 1.2, with the notice to Turn hands of clock
            quickly; 3 o’clock at <a href="#tln_0615" class="ref lb">615</a>, and 4
          o’clock at the interval curtain. But the next time it rings, it sounds 9 o’clock at <a href="#tln_1161" class="ref lb">1161</a>, presumably to account for the interval,
          then twice more, the last (10 o’clock) at <a href="#tln_1598" class="ref lb">1598</a>. The dialogue is adjusted either by cutting references to the passage of time
          (e.g., halfe an houre since—<a href="#tln_1051" class="ref lb">1051</a>) or by rewriting (nine, eight for <i>two</i>, <i>one</i>—<a href="#tln_1166" class="ref lb">1166</a>).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Very little of the play is cut, but some speeches are reassigned, as we have seen.
          Perhaps the most interesting rearrangement occurs at <a href="#tln_0290" class="ref lb">290–9</a>, part of Luciana’s speech on female subordination;
          these lines, which sound bookish, are spoken by Pinch, who enters reading a book and is
          perhaps quoting from it.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The 1962 Clifford Williams prompt-book contains by far the most detailed descriptions of
          movement of all these prompt-books. Pages of the unidentified printed play are pasted on
          workbook pages measuring 8″ x 10″ so as to put between 30 and 45 lines on a page, on
          average. Opposite these pages are the directions, sometimes as many as 30 to a page, which
          typically read (1.2): Enter U|S P|S Antipholus of Syracuse with 1st
            Merchant (to Ant’s P|S). X to C ros[trum] 1. Dromio of Syracuse follows X behind Ant to
            O|P C ros 1 to 8.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">1. 1 Mer gives Ant. money bag. Ant X to Dromio and gives it to him. 1 Mer
            break to P|S and face U|S. This full detail, some of it recording what common
          sense demands (giving and receiving the money bag), perhaps is the result of Williams’s
          having to get this production ready under emergency conditions, Paul Scofield’s inability
          to play Lear (above, ).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The stage consisted of a podium at the rear, a rostrum of two levels four steps lower,
          and a forestage or proscenium lower still. There is no scenery; the locked door (3.1) is
          mimed. The wittiest direction is the introduction to 2.1: [Luciana] carries a small
            felt board with patience [solitaire] cards which she begins to prepare—witty
          because she urges patience on the impatient Adriana.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">The language of the play is practically untouched, the changes being in the nature of
            lighter for <i>lesser</i> (<a href="#tln_0111" class="ref lb">111</a>), unstain’d for <i>distain’d</i> (<a href="#tln_0541" class="ref lb">541</a>), and
            Who for <i>That</i> (<a href="#tln_1829" class="ref lb">1829</a>); Thirtie three is changed to <i>Twenty three</i> (<a href="#tln_1890" class="ref lb">1890</a>). Most
          surprising is the single cut of Fly pride, says the peacock,
            mistress, that you know (<a href="#tln_1262" class="ref lb">1262–3</a>). <a href="#b_halw1979" class="ref bibl">Halstead</a>, who collates the 1963 revival, records a few more
          cuts.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Nunn’s 1977 production at the Aldwych cuts fewer than 100 lines, though many are used as
          songs. The play begins with the Duke’s I am not partial to infringe our
            laws (<a href="#tln_0008" class="ref lb">8</a>), followed by Egeon’s
          opening lines, then <a href="#tln_0009" class="ref lb">9–14</a>, minus Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more, which is moved to
          follow <a href="#tln_0023" class="ref lb">23</a>. The cuts of <a href="#tln_0068" class="ref lb">68</a>, <a href="#tln_0072" class="ref lb">72–8</a>, <a href="#tln_0101" class="ref lb">101–2</a>,
            <a href="#tln_0122" class="ref lb">122–4</a>, <a href="#tln_0143" class="ref lb">143–4</a>, <a href="#tln_0155" class="ref lb">155</a>, and <a href="#tln_0161" class="ref lb">161–2</a> pare away awkwardnesses, especially Try all the
            friends thou hast in <i>Ephesus</i> (<a href="#tln_0155" class="ref lb">155</a>), which seems silly considering that Egeon has just arrived
          after his five-year search for his sons. Well, perhaps a merchant might have business
          associates, a consideration that may explain why none of the other acting versions
          considered cuts the line. But he does not sound confident about getting the money.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Act 1 ends with the first song,  “Beg Thou,”  a setting of <a href="#tln_0156" class="ref lb">156–7</a>, performed while the
          stage is transformed into an outdoor cafe. In 1.2, only the joke about scoring on posts
            (<a href="#tln_0229" class="ref lb">229–30</a>) is cut. In
          2.1, the rhymed couplet <a href="#tln_0300" class="ref lb">300–1</a> is cut, making way for  “Liberty Song,”  set from <a href="#tln_0304" class="ref lb">304–16</a>. The garbled <a href="#tln_0385" class="ref lb">385–9</a> disappear. In 2.2,
          following porridge (<a href="#tln_0493" class="ref lb">493</a>) comes
          the setting of the jokes on time and baldness (<a href="#tln_0494" class="ref lb">494–502</a>), though the lines are not canceled as they are for
          all the other songs. The scene ends with  “Am I on Earth,”  set from
            <a href="#tln_0608" class="ref lb">608–12</a>.</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">Act 3.1 is the last before the interval; cuts include <a href="#tln_0713" class="ref lb">713–14</a>, <a href="#tln_0725" class="ref lb">725–6</a>, <a href="#tln_0756" class="ref lb">756–7</a>, <a href="#tln_0762" class="ref lb">762–3</a>, <a href="#tln_0766" class="ref lb">766–7</a>. The pattern of cutting, usually
          involving no more than a single obscure speech, continues in the second part. Antipholus’s
          wooing of Luciana provides  “Why Call You Me Love,”  a duet setting
          of <a href="#tln_0839" class="ref lb">839–60</a>. S.
          Antipholus’s wondering report of his treatment in Ephesus (<a href="#tln_1184" class="ref lb">1184–94</a>) is set as  “Everywhere I Go.”  In 4.4, E. Dromio’s lament over his unceasing punishment (<a href="#tln_1310" class="ref lb">1310–20</a>) is set as  “Beats Me.”  Lines <a href="#tln_1414" class="ref lb">1414–15</a> are bracketed, with  “Pinch Song and
            Dance”  written opposite them. Act 5 stands nearly untouched. Of the cuts,
            the Diall points at fiue (<a href="#tln_1587" class="ref lb">1587</a>), cut by Smock Alley but then allowed to stand until Komisarjevsky (whose
          set prominently features a clock), must seem unintelligible; and Egeon’s complaint about
          the transforming power of age (<a href="#tln_1788" class="ref lb">1788–98</a>) might cause unwanted merriment and is usually trimmed, from Smock Alley
          onward. Opposite  “Thirtie three”  (<a href="#tln_1890" class="ref lb">1890</a>) is a firmly written 25. The last song is  “Hand in Hand”  (<a href="#tln_1917" class="ref lb">1917–19</a>).</p>

        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="noindent">These prompt-books record the theatrical tastes of their eras, from a time beginning in
          the Restoration, when <i>Err.</i> could be cut to the barest of bones
          and serve as an after-piece lasting less than an hour, to Hull’s 18th-c. rewriting to make
          up for Sh.’s perceived deficiencies, to an increasing willingness to accept the play as it
          appears in F1. In this history, <i>Err.</i>’s fate is
          no, or not much, different from those of Sh.’s other plays.</p>
